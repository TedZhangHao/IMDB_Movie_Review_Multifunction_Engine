          "content": "Director and writer Ryan Coogler shared that some of his most vivid cinematic memories come from watching horror films in theaters as a young man - experiences that sparked his deep love for cinema. According to him, \"Sinners\" is a kind of love letter to that feeling, crafted with the hope that viewers in theaters will experience the same thrill. And honestly? Mission accomplished.\"Sinners\" is one of those films best experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible - we strongly recommend not reading anything, not watching trailers, and avoiding all conversations about it beforehand if you can. The film's plot flows with organic ease, taking unexpected and refreshing turns that hit especially well if you go in spoiler-free. So we'll steer clear of plot details here, too.The initial inspiration behind the film came from Coogler's connection to his late uncle, James, who had a deep interest in music and history, particularly in the Mississippi blues tradition. James's stories and musical tastes left a lasting impression on Coogler and sparked the creative process that ultimately became this film. As you might guess, \"Sinners\"is at its core a musical film. Not in the sense of a musical or a movie with original songs woven in like \"Django Unchained\" - rather, music is part of \"Sinners\"' DNA. It's interwoven into the story, the characters, and the entire atmosphere, offering a unique lens on the culture, folklore, traditions, and struggles of the Black community in 1930s Mississippi.The man behind the original score is the multi-talented Ludwig Göransson (\"Oppenheimer\", \"Tenet\", \"Black Panther\"), who, beyond being a top-tier music producer, continually reinvents himself with every project he touches. \"Sinners\" is no exception. In his relatively short but rich career, Göransson has produced electronic scores, orchestral compositions, and even rap and R&B. Here, he pivots once again - blending the score with musical production in an inspired exploration of the Blues and Country genres, in line with the film's tone. Traditional sounds, ambient textures, and gritty audio design are all used to balance the experience.It's undoubtedly one of the finest soundtracks we've heard in recent years - one that elevates the film to another level. Göransson continues to prove himself as one of the most gifted musicians of our era, and it's no wonder that none other than Christopher Nolan chose him as his go-to composer, following Hans Zimmer. In \"Sinners\", the soundtrack also features live performances and original songs, and a separate album has even been released featuring both songs from the film and those inspired by it.Visually, Coogler made a bold artistic choice - one reminiscent of cinema's greatest auteurs, like Nolan and Denis Villeneuve - to shoot the film using wide-format film stock, opting for analog cinematography. Specifically, the most grand and pure formats available: IMAX 15-perf 70mm and Ultra Panavision 70mm. This wasn't just an aesthetic decision, but an effort to merge the raw texture of classic cinema with the sheer visual power of modern technology - a symbolic gesture aligning with the themes the film explores. Coogler even sought guidance from Nolan himself, along with Emma Thomas, to master the use of these formats - not for bragging rights, but to amplify the film's emotional weight.Another standout aspect of the film is the screenplay. It's written with a natural rhythm and flow, featuring smart, unexpected humor and effortlessly blending a range of genres. Coogler, who served as both writer and director, brings the script to life with mastery, drawing the best out of each genre he touches. Above all, his use of the IMAX format is impressively deliberate and effective.Michael B. Jordan plays two distinct characters in the film - and not in a gimmicky or disconnected way. These characters interact constantly - they're twins - which makes for a serious acting challenge. Jordan rises to the occasion, and the visual effects team behind the scenes pulls it off beautifully, with impressive execution on every technical level. Visually, the film is nothing short of stunning.Alongside Jordan, musician Miles Caton gives a remarkably strong performance in the second lead role. I was genuinely surprised to learn this was his first-ever acting role. Jack O'Connell is also outstanding, and the radiant Hailee Steinfeld dazzles on screen and delivers a compelling performance. While she doesn't sing in the film itself, she is featured on the movie's official soundtrack. Overall, the cast is excellent, and the chemistry is on point.Every few months, there comes along an event film that simply must be seen - and \"Sinners\" is unquestionably one of them. It's one of the best films we've seen in recent memory: energetic, gripping, occasionally funny, with a sharp script, top-tier directing, brilliant performances, and musical ingenuity that stuns scene after scene. It has all the makings of a strong contender for film of the year. We highly recommend watching it in theaters - in the best auditorium you can find. IMAX, if possible, is absolutely the way to go.Written by Dvir971 & Orr971."

          "content": "'Sinners' is a dark, stylish and genuinely fresh take on the vampire genre. Set in 1930s Mississippi, it blends the gothic with the spiritual - vampires, church, blues music, and the weight of the segregated South - into something bold and unforgettable.Michael B. Jordan is magnetic playing twin brothers Smoke and Stack, each with their own vibe and purpose. Their chemistry anchors the film, but it's Hailee Steinfeld who steals scenes as Mary - a layered, quietly powerful performance that grounds the more surreal elements.There's a dark humour running beneath it all, and the music is incredible - bluesy, moody, full of soul. It's a film that takes risks with tone and style, but it all comes together. Vicious, vibey, and unlike anything else in the genre."

Jordans (even if he is a great actor); the action is well done.Not all is perfect, though, as the characters behave erratically, suiting the necessities of the plot more than behaving coherently. The change of pace can also be jarring. And even if the movie is more than two hours long, you might feel more advantage could've been taken from the amazing set up. But with so great music, so good all the elements (direction, acting, photography...), you will probably not care. Ryan Coogler has done a very good movie."

          "content": "Sinners is a familiar film with a different mix. This film raises themes such as oppression, struggle, family, and destiny. For the core story, it may be familiar, but Coogler makes it seem new. They present the supernatural elements as a symbol of racism in that era, with tension that is built slowly but surely, although there are still some things that feel cliché. In addition, there are many layers that make this film feel deeper and more complicated. The characters, personally, it is a bit difficult to distinguish Elijah and Elias because they are so identical, especially when entering the last half, but for the others it is very good, have characters and their own backgrounds. The pacing is very good, enjoyable. The cinematography is very beautiful from beginning to end, with a gripping visual tone too. The production design is solid, making the western vibes even more prominent. The sound design may not be magnificent but the details can still be heard. The blues music not only beautifies, but also becomes part of the story. The acting from the cast is all good, Hailee Steinfeld here really stands out in playing her character. Overall, a highly anticipated film and the results is not disappointing.9.4/10."

BUT it uses zoombie-elements not as a farce as we usually see it, but as a MEAN to actually tell a larger more solemn story about musicians, as well as the period. And that is an interesting idea, if it had been used in moderationI was close to walking out during the loooooong zoombie- part, but stayed, as I had a feeling that the film was too good to just be skipped. And well I think it was.That said, I like the (living) figures, they are generally well composed and well played.If you do see it, make sure to stay after the credits starts, we get a substantial end to the whole thing, before the major part of the credits. (and a tiny non-essential bonus at the very end)As I felt annoyed over a substantial part of the film, the grade ends a bit low."

          "content": "Sinners has a script that likely flows smoothly and effortlessly on paper. However, paper is a medium that leaves its reader free to feel to bridge any gaps that the story might have and the most importantly requires effort to imagine all scenes, characters and the interaction between these. So, if the story is interesting, the pacing is just something that happens naturally.However, while the take on the story is certainly not boring, the pacing seems oddly quite off. It is not about adding a constant source of action, but as sets are already decorated and the cast is dressed up that makes the imagination sit idle. Mind begins wandering when a lengthy backdrop is being created. Again, something that works very well with books where the author can spill adjectives and colorize even the tiniest detail with clever language, but not so much on the large screen.A lot from the first half could have been left on the cutting room floor, stored on some vast bit space left to used as B roll on future projects. Not only the pacing, but some of the story arches are perplexing as well. New ideas are presented and introduced that then go to a large degree completely unused and are therefore effectively wasted. As if there was a moment of bright idea, a scene was planned and captured, cut into the final version just to be never ever touched again. Almost as if going over a bucket list and coming to a realization, that the desire to do something was the thrill, not the activity itself, and thus crossing it over using a heavy handed stroke once and for all.That is shame, as using the standard production values, cast et. Al as the reference there is not much bad to say. When the end is closing in, the film transforms into the thing it should have been from the very beginning. The very last minutes are the best, but at that point the opportunity has gone and is past due.All is not lost, though, as with a supply of popcorn that is to last the entire runtime the experience should be much better. If no snacks are available, it might the best let this movie wait in the dark corner. This is ultimately an entry on which time and age do no much, if any, damage."

          "content": "My wife and I recently watched Sinners (2025) in theaters. The film tells the story of twin brothers from Mississippi who've just returned home from Chicago and are opening a nightclub during the Prohibition era. They're planning a grand opening celebration featuring an all-star lineup of local blues musicians-but a group of unwanted, bloodthirsty guests has plans to crash the party and ruin the night.Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed), the film stars Michael B. Jordan (Creed), Miles Caton, Delroy Lindo (Crooklyn), Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit), Omar Benson Miller (8 Mile), and Li Jun Li (Babylon).The first half of Sinners is rich with character development and cultural depth. The realism is brilliant-from the Mississippi/Chicago connection (which resonated deeply with my wife's own family background) to the incredible blues subplot that brings soul and authenticity to the story. The party scene alone is a masterclass in filmmaking-brimming with energy, culture, and community. Spike Lee would be proud.Delroy Lindo delivers yet another underrated performance-he was probably my favorite character. Michael B. Jordan is excellent as always, and Miles Caton makes a powerful breakout debut. The acting across the board is full of nuance, expression, and authenticity.The horror elements, particularly the vampire twist, are expertly woven in. Much like From Dusk Till Dawn, the film shifts gears midway through, transforming into something entirely different for a stretch. But unlike Dusk, which leans into fun chaos, Sinners pulls the themes back together with real emotional and narrative depth. The horror doesn't overwhelm-it enhances. The film's final act ties both worlds together in a meaningful, thought-provoking way.I haven't even mentioned the era-accurate details-attire, dialogue, lifestyle, and perspective-all spot-on. Sinners is a layered, well-executed film that delivers far more than just horror thrills.In conclusion, Sinners is a powerful, character-driven story with horror woven in-not just a good horror film, but a great film, period. Ryan Coogler, the cast, and the production team all knocked it out of the park. I'd give it a solid 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."

Southern America blues and vampires.The standout here being the incredible soundtrack from no other than Ludwig Göransson. The sexy, bluesy tone is definitely my favourite thing of the film. It was the glue that kept the film going. The film was reminiscent of O'brother Where Art Thou with a healthy dose of From Dusk Till Dawn.The patience in the first act to set up the thematic relationships and overall story was executed perfectly. Even though we all were expecting the \"reveal\" to come, the journey to get to that point was arguably the better part of the film.What separates (and elevates) this film from your standard supernatural horror flick is the fact that the director chose to spend more time in the first act developing our and exploring our characters.However, in saying this I do feel like the film in the end of the second and entire third act fell into the cliches that they vampire genre usually entails. The last minute sunrise for example or the character who knows all the ins-and-outs of killing a vampire.I believe at this point the film lost a bit of spark that the first act patiently created.I still love what Coogler did. The unique genre blend, soundtrack and setting is enough to warrant the praise.Best film of 2025?"

Even once the vampire action starts, it feels like its over without anything significant happening. Then there's the ending that feels totally unnecessary and just a chance to ram the racial message home without any purpose.There's no doubt there was a lot of passion and talent bringing this to life, but it feels so empty and hollow its a shame really."

We start with Sammie/\"Preachers Boy\" (Caton) and then are introduced to his notorious cousins who have just returned from Chicago - twins Smoke & Stack, both played by Jordan, who clearly relishes the run he gets to have. He plays them both subtly different enough that you can tell who's who.It all occurs in one day, with the first hour setting the scene well, as we're introduced to ex-girlfriends - Mary (Steinfeld) and Annie (Mosaku) - plus Slim (Lindo) and Cornbread (Miller), who are brought in to help Smoke & Stack open up their \"Juke\" bar. Key to everything is Sammie, his guitar and the blues. We're then introduced to Remmick (O'Connell), who is a charming Irishman, hiding a sinister secret.I won't spoil the twist, but it doesn't take long for the film to turn to a horror, and does well to start off with a bit of tension and suspense and then go full blown bloody action/fight/gore. Holding it together is the great soundtrack and score, with the music great throughout. Just over 2 hours, but never boring - solidly wrapped up, some great scenes. Stay after the initial credits, as there's a ~5min final scene."

People doesn't know what a vampire movie is??? Definitely not to be a musical!!!!!The acting from the protagonists is mediore at best! The acting from that woman(Steinfeld) is cringe and corny! She's so bad at acting, at least in this movie, not convincing at all!Michael B Jordan as well, his acting is the same in every movie! I liked O'Connel guy..he was decent! For a vampire movie, again, there's little blood and gore and i was sooooo disappointed!!! I want my vampires movies to be brutal and nasty!! 3 stars from 10 for some good cinematography! That's all! One of the best vampire movie will remain \"30 days of night\"!"

          "content": "Ryan Coogler was pulled into the franchise machine soon after his debut feature Fruitvale Station (2013). Since then, he's revived the Rocky franchise with Creed (2015) and entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe with his two Black Panther films. Along the way, he's helped elevate other filmmakers as a producer, including Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II (2018)), Shaka King (Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)), and his longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan in his directorial debut, Creed III (2023). But Coogler's return to an original project has taken over a decade-and it's finally here with his horror film Sinners (2025).Sinners is set in 1930s Mississippi, where twin brothers Smoke and Stack (both played by Jordan) return from Chicago with dubiously acquired wealth. They plan to open a juke club featuring some of the best blues musicians in the county, including the veteran Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) and a young prodigy, Sammie Moore (Miles Caton). The film unfolds over the course of a single day and night-the club's grand opening-as the local Black community comes together for one night of freedom, even as a sinister presence, the white stranger Remmick (Jack O'Connell), looms in the shadows.Written solely by Coogler-his first solo screenplay since Fruitvale Station-Sinners is another contained, one-day narrative that attempts to capture a lifetime's worth of relationships, regrets, and social commentary within limited hours. That structure proved devastatingly effective in Fruitvale Station, which builds toward its tragic climax with intimate care. But in Sinners, Coogler seems caught between two impulses: indulging in the B-movie, grindhouse horror influences that inspire the film's genre moments, or focusing on the more character-driven and historical themes-the psychological toll of the Great Migration, and the disconnect between those who left and those who stayed behind in the South. Coogler appears far more invested in the latter. The supernatural, though occasionally potent, feels like an afterthought, more interested in the transcendent power of music than any monster lurking in the dark.It's in its treatment of music-especially the blues-that Sinners finds its most magical and resonant moments. The film opens with a voiceover that posits great music as a force capable of transcending time and space, collapsing past, present, and future into a shared liminal space. That power, however, also attracts evil. If that last twist feels tacked-on, it's because it does in the film too. Still, Sinners delivers one of the most breathtaking scenes in recent cinema when Sammie plays his first song: the crowd is overtaken by the melody, and suddenly we see a man with an electric guitar burst forth, a DJ spinning on stage, dancers in 90s hip-hop gear twerking beside figures dressed in pre-colonial West African garb. It's a breathtaking collision of generations-a moment reminiscent of the floating audience in Rocketman (2019) or the invisible band-mates session in Begin Again (2013). It's Coogler at his most inspired-but the spell is broken when the film pivots to a jarring final act of standard horror fare.When Sinners does veer into horror, the scenes are gripping, with impactful choreography and tense staging. But they barely last ten minutes. Much of the rest is spent with characters deciphering supernatural lore, doubting themselves, and moving through familiar survival beats. The film even tosses in some questionable character sacrifices and lazy twist endings, all of which feel like setup for a potential franchise rather than a satisfying standalone. It's a tonal and thematic clash with the richer, more historical story that begins the film.As with most of Coogler's work, Michael B. Jordan leads the cast, this time pulling double duty as both twins. Jordan remains an incredibly charismatic performer, with undeniable screen presence-but he struggles to distinguish Smoke from Stack. While Robert Pattinson gave a masterclass in differentiating clones in Mickey 17 (2025), here, aside from costuming, the brothers blur into one another. Fortunately, the supporting cast shines. Wunmi Mosaku and Hailee Steinfeld deliver strong performances as former flames of the twins, while Lindo once again steals scenes as a drunken veteran bluesman. But the real standout is newcomer Miles Caton, who not only sings beautifully but also grounds the film with a tender, restrained performance as a young man caught between opportunity and temptation, never losing his sense of self.On a technical level, Sinners is as polished as Coogler's past films, with lush costuming, atmospheric production design, a distinctive score by Ludwig Göransson, and some chilling practical makeup effects during horror sequences. The film begins as a compelling character study and exploration of historical displacement, then flirts with magical realism through the intergenerational power of music. But the horror elements feel stapled on, and Coogler himself seems disinterested in them, offering only brief, undercooked genre thrills near the end.In the end, Sinners is a fascinating but uneven film-one that shows Coogler straining between commercial pressures and his own artistic instincts. It's still worth watching for its ambition and moments of brilliance, but it also leaves you wishing he'd followed his original voice all the way through."

There is a history within it - as is with one particular scene ... that takes us on a journey through what was, what is (current time the movie is supposed to be in) and what is about to come.There are also a lot of gruesome scenes - so you can't be too sensitive and sensible about some of the stuff that is going to happen ... also I had no idea that Michael B. Jordan was playing two roles in this ... I do wonder (and hope) he got paid accordingly ... he obviously has a lot of fun doing it (again sorry for the pun).

Really captured that rough and ready time of 1930s America.I thought every actor involved did an amazing job with their characters, there were a lot of characters to get to know and all of them had heart soul and a story to tell.The onscreen chemistry Michael B Jordan was able to conjure with everyone including himself was amazing to watch. The film had a very nice pace to it, funny in parts and pleasant to watch and listen to....... but then the vampire stuff came in.Honestly, it was fine but I don't think the film needed it. I would've been quite happy to see the twins past demons catch up on each other and maybe some old enemies come knocking at the door who they swindled or robbed in the past.Then watch them get out of that jam with the help of everyone in the town who they manage to wrap around their finger. I would've been quite happy with that.But, how the vampires came into the story I didn't understand, I didn't understand what the cousins music had to do with it, I didn't understand why they made it about the kkk (they addressed this separately afterwards which was fine)\nLike I said, I really enjoyed the film. It looked and sounded fantastic. I just think the vampire stuff derailed it a bit and when things started getting going with that section everything was breezed through in about 5 mins.Spoiler belowWhen the vampires finally get in all but 2 characters are killed in seconds so everything we got to learn about them up until that point was kinda for nothing."

          "content": "Enjoyed this one a lot. It had a solid setup for all of the characters involved and took its sweet time for the life and death fight to start, so be prepared for a slow burn. The vamp(s) don't even make an appearance until 43-45 minutes in, and even after that, it's a while before their existence is known to the rest of the characters. I liked that this took place back in the early 20th century; it felt very much like the period piece that it was supposed to be. I also liked how the vamp lore was woven into the storyline before and even after the characters figured out what they were up against. I'd been hoping to rate this higher, but some missteps in the writing in the final act were too much to ignore so I pulled my rating back a tad. A re-watch might make me notch it back a little more but for now I'll keep it at this. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in dual roles playing twin brothers, and the rest of the cast was solid. There is gore/violence and sex, so if this is a problem for you, you've been forewarned. Also, there is a fairly lengthy mid-credits scene followed by a shorter post-credit scene, so be sure to stick around for that. Video review will be available on my YouTube channel shortly."

Watching him play a mob boss with that kind of presence, layered intensity, and vulnerability was something else. This isn't your typical action-horror flick - it's got depth, culture, and style.One of the best things about the movie is how deeply rooted it is in Black culture. The soundtrack hits hard - from gritty trap beats to soulful moments, it all adds to the atmosphere. The dark, almost gothic vibe throughout the film works perfectly with the story, making the whole thing feel immersive and stylish.The plot holds up well. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's solid and keeps you hooked. The pacing is tight, and the fight scenes? Brutal, slick, and beautifully choreographed. I found myself rewinding a couple of times just to see some of those punches land again. The vampire element is super cool too - the way they're introduced, the look, the feel... yeah, very on point.Now, not everything's perfect. Some of the vampire \"superpowers\" felt kinda off - like the mechanics didn't fully click or make sense at times. It's not a dealbreaker, but it pulled me out of the moment here and there.That said, I left the movie with mixed emotions - in a good way. I wanted more. More of that world, more of Jordan being a badass mob vampire, more of that gritty atmosphere. Sinners is definitely one of those movies that stays with you after the credits roll.8.5/10 - Stylish, intense, and full of soul. Worth the watch."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners\" is not just a film-it's a cinematic séance. Set in 1932 Jim Crow-era Mississippi, this supernatural horror story resuscitates buried traumas, breathes life into folklore, and sets it all ablaze with righteous fury.What begins as a quiet return home morphs into a fever-dream of blood, blues, and reckoning, as \"Sinners\" merges historical reality with hoodoo mysticism and Southern Gothic dread to deliver a genre-defying masterpiece.At the heart of the narrative are twin brothers Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\"-both portrayed with mesmerizing distinction by Michael B. Jordan-World War I veterans trying to carve out a future by opening a juke joint in their hometown of Clarksdale.But their homecoming turns harrowing when they uncover a parasitic evil feeding off their community, embodied most viscerally by Remmick, a white vampire musician who's as charismatic as he is monstrous. He doesn't just suck blood-he steals sound, identity, and culture. Coogler doesn't whisper his critique-he howls it.Drawing inspiration from the legend of Robert Johnson and the crossroads mythos, Coogler infuses Sinners with Southern Black folklore, Yoruba deities, and hoodoo ritual.The figure of Elegba, the guardian of paths and choices, looms as a spiritual presence, guiding (and sometimes mocking) the characters as they navigate a landscape littered with racial violence and metaphysical threats.The result is a rich, textured mythology that grounds the film's supernatural horrors in lived Black experience-where every ghost is tethered to history, and every monster mirrors the ones etched in textbooks.Ludwig Göransson's score is a masterclass in emotional layering-mixing raw Delta blues with cinematic scope. His work, steeped in field recordings and haunted guitar riffs, becomes a character in itself, channeling the pain and passion of a people whose music outlives their wounds.\"Sinners\" captures the Southern heat and hell with stunning clarity. Every frame feels aged in bourbon and blood-cinema that burns like a backwoods sermon.There's a tactile grit to \"Sinners\" that feels both classic and contemporary. The practical effects nod to '80s creature features, while the stylized action moments-evoking '90s grit à la Rambo-clash spectacularly with the ornate period setting.It's anachronistic, chaotic, and completely intentional. In Coogler's 2025, history is not just remembered-it is ruptured and reassembled through a horror lens that exposes the real monsters: exploitation, silence, and stolen legacy.Jordan's dual performance is nothing short of hypnotic. With the aid of real-life twins Noah and Logan Miller and dialect coach Beth McGuire, he creates two fully distinct individuals-Smoke, the idealist bruised by hope, and Stack, the skeptic scarred by war.Their chemistry, or perhaps their dissonance, anchors the film's emotional core. As the brothers face off against literal and figurative vampires, their personal demons prove just as lethal.Remmick is one of modern horror's most chilling metaphors for cultural appropriation. He doesn't just imitate the blues-he ingests it, regurgitates it, and sells it back to the world, sanitized and soulless. Through him, Sinners lays bare the grotesque cycle of theft that haunts Black artistic expression.Amid the film's supernatural chaos, \"Sinners\" also carves space for its female characters-particularly Mama Odetta, a hoodoo priestess played with quiet ferocity by Aunjanue Ellis-whose presence anchors the story in generational wisdom and the often-overlooked burden Black women carry as spiritual protectors, healers, and witnesses to trauma.In contrast, Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), a white outsider drawn to the seductive pull of Black ritual and vampiric lore, enters the coven not out of malice, but as an act of rebellion-fascinated by a power structure that defies her own genteel Southern constraints.Her arc evokes the rebellious femininity of '90s cult figures like Nancy from The Craft or Akasha from Queen of the Damned-women who crave transformation, even if it means aligning with darkness.Coogler doesn't offer easy catharsis. The film builds toward an apocalyptic fever pitch, where history itself seems to bleed out onto the screen. By the time the final note is struck, and the last flame extinguished, we're left in a world that feels eerily like our own-chaotic, fractured, and haunted by unresolved grief.In the ever-evolving landscape of horror, \"Sinners\" isn't just another period piece with supernatural seasoning. It's a landmark in the genre-a Southern-fried scream into the abyss of American memory.Coogler has crafted a film that's equal parts exorcism and elegy. In this tale of blood, rhythm, and reckoning, Coogler reminds us that the past isn't behind us-it's buried beneath our feet, clawing to be heard.\"Sinners\" isn't just a period horror-it's a cinematic séance, an exorcism of American amnesia."

It should be brought to the forefront. It should drive the story. It should be a character in itself. It should give you goosebumps in the big moments. Sinners is one of the best examples of this.Aside from the music, I could tell I was watching high-quality filmmaking within five minutes. The directing, camerawork, editing, and sound design are pristine. The entire cast does a great job, but Michael B. Jordan shines. He is a superstar.Sinners is also surprisingly funny, without taking away from the seriousness. And the horror elements are... satisfying. This movie goes hard.Advice: Certain scenes have an expanded aspect ratio that will only be shown in IMAX. If you can't go to an IMAX, any premium screen will do (Dolby Cinema, UltraScreen, EMX, etc). This movie benefits more than most from the larger screen and louder speakers.Also, I missed A LOT of the dialogue, you may want to ask for a closed caption device.(1 viewing, opening night IMAX 4/17/2025)"

Jordan staking vampires between sets of push-ups.Well, guess what, buddy? Surprise: you walked into a Ryan Coogler film that serves you blues, poetry, and Black pain like a sacred offering.The film plays like The Legend of 1900 remixed by Robert Johnson mid-satanic pact. The horror? It's a metaphor. The monsters? Symbols. And you, the viewer? A willing victim who realizes twenty minutes in that you're not watching a slasher... you're deep in a mystical odyssey shot like a fever dream on opium.Twins. One actor. Zero missteps. No crappy green screen, no clunky split-screen from The Parent Trap. Nah-this is clean, surgical, fluid. You'd swear the guy was cloned in a cave by a Shaolin monk.And the wildest part? He plays both brothers with completely different energies. One radiates light, the other broods darkness, and both exude elegance and pain in equal measure. This isn't acting-it's black magic. At this level, it's no longer performance-it's full-blown demonic possession captured in 4K.Want originality? You got it. No looped rap tracks like in 99% of U. S. films about Black characters. Here, it's the blues. The real stuff. The kind that comes from guts, chains, cotton fields, and dust. And believe me-it cuts deeper than a Slash guitar solo strung with prison wire.Every note haunts you. Every chord summons ghosts. The music is a doorway between worlds, a call to the Old Ones, a ritual that raises goosebumps. Ryan Coogler delivers a film where the score isn't just background-it's a damn hex. You don't listen-you endure it. And you want more.There's one scene. Just one. But my God. Straight into the cinematic hall of fame.The party scene.At once orgiastic, sacred, primal and cosmic. It's Eyes Wide Shut in the bayou. There's voodoo, groove, bodies melting together, lurking entities, and a one-take shot that knocks the wind out of you like three shots of mezcal and a bad peyote trip.It's not just well-made-it's divine. Filmed from the gut, edited with fire and silence, it grabs your stomach and wrings out your spine. The kind of scene that makes you believe God listens to the blues in a sweaty Louisiana basement.We love Coogler. But someone needs to tell him: bro, your intro plays like an episode of Murder, She Wrote. You wanna build atmosphere? Fine. But don't make us wait an hour with \"Twins Return to the Village and Do Mystical Gardening.\"It drags. It stretches. You wait for the film to kick in like you're waiting for meaningful reform in France. Meanwhile, flashbacks hit every ten minutes, reminding you that pain is apparently a damn art form.It's noble, it's deep-but man, it's long. This needed some trimming, less Terrence Malick meditation, and a bit more fang in this occult fable.You came for chills, you got a full-on spiritual initiation drilled into your spinal cord.Sinners promises the Devil, delivers the blues, and implants visions in your mind. It's slow to start, yeah.But when it hits... it hits like a sermon from Hell.It's not a slap. It's an incantation. A trance. A film that doesn't scare you-but follows you into your dreams like a damned old bluesman whispering in your ear with B. B. King's voice and the stare of a demon.And that's when you get it:\nWhen you dance with the Devil long enough...\nIt's not him coming to you-\nIt's you who opens the door."

And there is only 10% we can call maybe an action and it's not all at the same time. I am really really disappointed watching this movie with my girlfriend tonight and I am really bored while watching this movie. It was extremely difficult to sit on the cinema and watch till the end.

After finally watching it, I can say with confidence that this is my favorite movie so far to come out in 2025. When twin brother Smoke and Stack return home from Chicago to rural Mississippi for a fresh start, they decide to take what earnings they got left to open a nightclub. Unfortunately, other than some of their old hometown friends, old lovers, and a cousin, a much evil and greater force awaits for them just in time for the debut night of their new club. For starters, Michael B. Jordan gives probably the best performance of his career so far as the twins Smoke and Stack, bringing a different persona and personality to each of the characters. Hailee Steinfeld as Mary is magnificent and for the most part has some of the best character development of the film. Wunmi Mosaku as Annie is also great in this film, while also being a huge part of the heart and soul of it. Miles Caton as Sammie Moore is also a great addition to this film and plays a very important role in it. Omar Miller as Cornbread was also a great addition. Delroy Lindo as Delta Slim also gives a great supporting performance, while also having some of the best lines and moments of the movie. Finally Jack O' Connell as Remmick and the main villain of the movie was absolutely fantastic, terrifying, while also charming in a way and is probably one the best horror movie villains I've seen in recent years. Every time his character is on screen, he steals the show and more than gets the audience's attention. If there's anything negative I have to say about the film which is little to none, I would say in the first act, it took awhile for the story to get going, but once it does finally start to take off, it makes everything more than worth while. For positives, I would like to point out that music playing a huge role and technically a character itself in the film was sensational. The horror elements were also well done, as well as a couple of action scenes that were very impressive. Overall, Sinners is so far my favorite movie of 2025, with great performances all the way around, great cinematography, and a really great story with the direction of Ryan Coogler giving Jordan Peele a run for his money in the horror genre. Rating 10/10."

The film sets a moody, atmospheric tone and builds tension with a deliberate, slow-burn approach that hints at something truly impactful. Unfortunately, that promise is never fulfilled. When the vampires finally appear, the film takes a sharp downturn. Their behavior is nonsensical, lacking any real menace or intelligence, and they end up feeling more like a parody than a threat. It's a baffling creative choice that undermines everything the first half works so hard to build. Despite its strong technical elements, the film stumbles badly at the finish line. A stylish misfire-watchable, but disappointing. 6 out of 10."

S. black population, and others lorded over by oppressors.Subsequently, two brothers and a community must decide how they can exploit music for profit... Or, to make them less vulnerable to the evil it was thought to generate. The use of special effects is clever and not too distracting...though, this IS, afterall a monster movie.Delroy Lindo should get a nice tux and start preparing some comments because he is going to become the center of this film's gravitational pull for months....scene stealer extraordinaire; a classic supporting actor triumph. Michael B Jordan's multifaceted role also worthy of some extra attention.And then, there's the music.... 🎼 +++ which is enhanced by costumes, which is enhanced by sets. Over all, an amazing film worth seeing. Glad to have seen it in IMAX at Grauman's in Hollywood tonight!"

But weirdly enough, I didn't hate it. In fact, there were parts I genuinely enjoyed, especially the action sequences.It was just mid. Not terrible, not great - just somewhere in the middle.

The movie feels like it has the DNA of the era's music embedded into every scene that is soulful, gritty, and alive.That emotional heartbeat is darkly, almost violently, contrasted when the supernatural element enters, bringing a wave of gore and terror that feels both inevitable and shocking. The cast is masterful, owning the early, quieter character-driven moments with such authenticity that when hell finally breaks loose, you feel every second of it.By the time Sinners reaches its devastating, poignant ending, you're left not just shaken but thinking. It's the kind of film that lingers long after the credits roll."

I could easily finish the review right there with those 3 simple words as 'Sinners' is THAT damn good and you should, without a doubt, believe the hype.I am one for slow, masterful, character building so sit tight for the first hour because this movie sets the tone and introduces every single character within, and delivers like no horror that I have seen before.We meet Michael B. Jordan as he portrays twins, Smoke & Stack and this guy gets cooler each time I see him perform on the big screen but a special shoutout must go to Miles Caton who plays Sammie. Miles delivers a stunning performance throughout. The supporting cast including Delroy Lindo (Delta), Hailee Steinfeld (Mary), Jack O' Connell (Remick) & Andrene Ward-Hammond (Ruthie) are all very much welcome additions.The tone is set during the opening hour but when the dark of night sets in with a beautiful supporting soundtrack, the movie gets dark and gnarly very quickly and it's one of the most tense vampire settings ever.You'll notice similarities to Dusk til Dawn, 30 days of night & The Thing.The final act is gut wrenching and blood soaked, so strap in.... Oh and don't leave before the cut scene during the end credits, it's vital to the story and one of the most beautiful endings to a horror movie that I've ever witnessed, to the point of that 'lump in your throat feeling'Overall, Sinners is gorgeous, it's simply outstanding.Please do believe the hype, please do go and see it on the big screen, it's purpose filmed so don't miss out.It's a 10/10 from me......Go again you ask?! Hell Yeah!!\"Last time I seen the sun\""

The movie often feels very lively due to it's musical numbers.The film's fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together, whether be it oppression of race, or preaching of good and evil. Jordan gives a great performance, while the rest of the cast were terrific too.Although the horror element was less than my expectations, however the political satire and the tense atmosphere makes Sinners a great movie.The Geek Reviewer gives 4 stars for 'Sinners'."

I kept waiting for something big to happen, but it never really did. The story didn't move much, and it started feeling repetitive. It's not a horrible movie, but it's definitely not cinema material. Maybe it works as a background movie while chilling at home, but not one I'd recommend spending money on for a theater ticket. Just too slow and too musical for my taste."

It's romantic. It's funny. It's chilling.It will stick with you long after the credits roll. (Make sure to stay for the post-credit scenes!)Utterly brilliant."

I don't understand the amazing reviews for this, considering it wasn't all that great. There are plenty of better vampire movies out there. This is definitely ryan cooglers weakest film in his discography. One good thing i will say about this film, is that the visuals were pleasing and the camera work was good. The score was very underwhelming and could have been better to save this film. Save yourself some money and watch this when it becomes available to rent."

The story itself seems to lend itself to possible sequels because otherwise it seemed unnecessarily drawn out for what the crescendo offered. It was certainly cinematic and definitely a good movie but is it a (currently) 8.1 good? I can't agree with that at all. Its a 7.0 for the amazing musical scenes the character depth the acting and cinematic feel but as we delve into the future of movies is it fair to say this is what we now consider an 8.1 or are we so destroyed by the mindless churn of superhero movies and Netflix emptiness that anything that's good outside of the norm now becomes great? I would recommend this movie even though I sound negative,I'm not I'm trying to be realistic and it was over sold in my opinion but it's still very much enjoyable."

Those who didn't go must've either known something I didn't, or knew what Coogler would divulge. I can tell you for sure though, after seeing it, the movie constantly battles itself, and can't rise above the soon-to-be forgotten movies of 2025.There are amazing scenes here and there, great dialogue, sound musical numbers (including one unique one, specifically), and some nice shots, but the movie then gets weighed down by big plot holes, dragging scenes, NWA, and one of the three endings being a massive waste of \"story\".The movie fights itself in both the good and the bad, but doesn't have enough of either to fall out of the \"eh\"/mediocre conversation. Note, that the folks who come out shouting it's a 10/10, as well as those who say it's not even a 1/10, are both wrong, and just want to sway the reviews/ratings one way or the other.The true rating will be when the masses see this movie via a streaming service in 2-3 months. Then, and only then, will the crowd realize that this wasn't a masterpiece, nor was it a failure, but it'll join the middle of the pack for 2025, and will fall into mediocrity as society continues to get bored of Coogler's thoughts toward a certain demographic."

Story, cinematography, score, sound design, casting and overall tone of the film. Hats off to cast and crew for delivering one of the best original stories we have seen in a while. \"Sinners\" not only holds the title for best film of the year so far, but definitely has one of the greatest scenes of the past decade. A stunning sequence showcasing a production masterpiece on all fronts. From a cast standpoint, they all were fantastic, especially Michael B Jordan's dual performance which is simply remarkable. However, Jack O'Connell was by far my favourite performance and wish we had juts a bit more of him. The films biggest strength is the use of music, every scene pours out heart and soul in honour of the blues and allows such an immersive experience that pulls you in until the very end. My only complaint would be that the final act felt a bit rushed, the build up was perfectly paced throughout the entire film, only to have the conflict feel like it ended so quickly.Overall, \"Sinners\" is a film that kept me on the edge of my seat, filled with beautiful production value and a score that will be stuck in my head for years to come. Can easily see this being rewatched over and over again."

          "content": "A unique genre blend that dazzles from the moment the sun rises over the Southern horizon. Sinners is Coogler's first fore-ray into genre filmmaking and even now he reinvents and seamlessly blends the two into a proverbial feast for the eyes. Blues music gets a keen focal epiphany as it decorates the screen visually as a form of magic. Powerful enough to burn a building down. Magic powerful enough that lures in the Devil before you know...Typically you see vampires as representatives of sex, sin and other worldly temptation, and while Ryan Coogler doesn't necessarily reinvent this archetypal motif, he does, however, deliver a well-rounded cinema experience that just so happens to have these blood sucking creatures of the night. This film is much more of a slow burn than we've seen with horrors of the year so far, Leigh Whannel's 2025 Wolf Man a prime example for a film that just begins at the beast in question and doesn't stop.Themes of cultural oppression and societal woes and pain are also evident and pivotal to the progression of our characters journeys. Having dealt with great losses and sacrifices before they left for Chicago, the twins have the hardened view of the world one would expect following their serving in the war. The pain shines through the interactions, especially with Annie and Mary.We open on Mississippi, circa 1932. It's a world that is pulled right out history as the inequalities of Southern workers talk of Plantation life and Plantation scrip, and the looming threat of Klansman constantly reminding the characters of the danger of looking the wrong way. Coogler leads the first act as a cursive note, detailing the truths, before bleeding in the supernatural fodder.The audience glimpse a young staggering figure entering a church, he clutches the neck of a destroyed guitar and a deep slash across the left side of his face. The film then jumps back to a day prior, as we grow to learn of the return of the infamous Smokestack twins, performed with nuance and strength by Michael B. Jordan in a display of his breadth of acting talent.They have returned from Chicago with the idea of opening a juke club to be filled with booze and blues, behind them large caches of money. It would've been easy for Jordan to take the performance of the twins to be caricatures of cartoon figures, Smoke is the much more grounded twin, having dealt with tragedy while Stack is obvious the more loose twin. Instead of giving the audience the largely obvious opportunities to clearly tell the two apart, but Coogler and Jordan are more exact in the details that separate the two as individual characters.The picture itself is bathed in a warm, golden glow, especially when we move into the setting of Club Juke, it's a vibrant and welcoming atmosphere, and the moment Miles Catton begins to serenade the crowd, and of course the audience, it's gives probably my favourite sequence of the whole film; harking back to the short voiceover giving way to the entrance of the vampires, it's told that people gifted in the creation of music allow for histories of old to come forward. A rich history of music across multiple generations and cultures dance and perform around young Preacher Boy and the patrons of 1932, the crescendo of the powerful blues Catton strums coinciding with the building burning to a cinder crisp. And yet they don't stop enjoying the sound, embers of the wooden mill and ferocious licking flames writhing around the dance floor. It's inspiration and grand, while also maintaining a simplicity in the camera work. And this is also the scene which edges us into the third act vampiric bloodbath.Jack O'Donnell blew his performance out of the water as the lead vampire, and while he doesn't have much screen time, he commands it when you do see him. A natural born leader, and a metamorphic ability I've seen in his earliest works. Miles Catton's film debut, and it's sure to lead him on a fruitful journey; he's a powerhouse here. Sammy has a quiet, reserved nature but a fiery temper bubbles deep within.The entire cast deliver phenomenal performances, helped along by each other, as the story progresses forward into a blood drenched fight. This is a worthwhile viewing experience, and one that I'll be excited to experience once again."

Jordan does double duty as unlikeable twin hustlers Smoke and Stack who return after a long absence to early 30s Clarksdale, Mississippi (aka the birthplace of the Blues, the music that Led Zeppelin claimed they wrote until the lawsuits piled up). To start their own late night juke joint. When the music finally gets underway an interesting sequence worthy of a Broadway musical occurs that evokes not only Robert Johnson but primal African music, 60s and 70s Funk, Hip Hop and all the African American forms that emerged in the 20th century. Indeed the music evokes spirits of all kinds, and sure enough white banjo playing vampires show up for some reason. Somehow ethnic music is supposed to symbolize the forces of American racial good and evil, and in any event all Hell breaks loose. Despite nice stand out performances from Hailee Steinfeld and Jayne Lawson as spurned lovers and the wonderful return of long AWOL Delroy Lindo, Sinners feels like some sort of muddled statement on historical racial injustice and music meets the vampire movie that could have used a few more drafts. Check out Crossroads or Angel Heart. They have the same atmosphere and issues but get to the point much more quickly."

They enlist their sheltered musical virtuoso younger cousin along the way. The less scrupulous brother crosses paths with an ex-lover. The brothers soon discover that the establishment they purchased from the Klan members has a massive presence of courtly, but ferocious vampires.Michael B. Jordan is exceptional in a dual role as the twin brothers. Hailee Steinfeld is alternatively seductive and menacing as his old flame. Jack O'Connell is a delight as the leader of the cabal of vampires. And newcomer Miles Caton is superb as the younger cousin who gets his first look at life outside his father's church.Without getting into too much detail, it takes a patient viewing to absorb the slow-burn, but ultimately hard-hitting power of Ryan Coogler's electric horror thriller. Just when you think the film has settled in, it suddenly achieves new heights of terror and ecstasy. The power of music is a recurring theme. In the best scene of the film, music is able to summons spirits of the past and future in a sequence that is intoxicating and enthralling to the point that I wanted to scream. Although the narrative can be a bit uneven, the end result is haunting and thrilling. One doesn't have to be a vampire film buff to find this memorable. Make you sure you keep watching until the film is over. Really over. Enthusiastically recommended."

I'm glad I made the effort, because I thoroughly enjoyed the film, which feels like a black From Dusk Till Dawn set in the Jim Crow era, the plot shifting gears midway, suddenly switching from a '30s drama brimming with emotion, mysticism and plenty of wonderful blues music to a fully-fledged horror flick loaded with blood and gore.Michael B. Jordan plays two roles, cousins Smoke and Stack, who return to Mississippi from Chicago in order to open a blues night club. Newcomer Miles Caton plays their younger cousin Sammie, who dreams of making it as a bluesman, and who is happy to perform at the club on opening night. Unfortunately, the evening doesn't go as planned, three strangers interrupting the festivities, turning the club into a slaughterhouse.Director Ryan Coogler's handling of the film is excellent, somehow combining drama with musicality, the supernatural, the occasionally absurd and the horrific in a manner that feels perfectly natural. It's a magical mix that reminded me at times of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, only with a lot more blood, and that's not a bad thing. The film is visually breathtaking throughout, no more so than during Sammie's performance in the club, a scene that is daring, dazzling and delightfully surreal, as past, present and future collide. That said, all of the song and dance scenes are superb, and as much as I appreciated the blood and guts in the final act, the musical moments were my favourite parts of the film.My rating for Sinners is 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."

If you're going to steal material and ideas from other movies and filmmakers, then you should steal from those who came long before you. This is what Tarantino admittedly does. Consequently, the movie's twin brothers should have been named Smoke and Mirrors.The movie tries to do too much, which is why it takes a long time, way too long, to get to where it's going. The combination of genres and ideas is forced and convoluted, even sloppy at times. After getting to the climax and final confrontation, the movie ends abruptly and feels anticlimactic. Perhaps this is due to the first attempt at writing \"original\" material (even though some of it is obviously borrowed). Previous screenplays were based on source material or existing intellectual property, which gave a creative cushion.One interesting element of the film lies in its homoeroticism and gay undertones. The clear attraction of Remmick to Sammie and the subversive male intimacy cannot be mistaken. It is a relationship that would have been heavily stigmatized and criminalized during the era of the story, which is why the queer coding occurs through music and a vampire.Music connects Remmick (a portmanteau of REMember and MICK) and Sammie (an emasculation of Samuel) in a relationship between Irish music and the Blues. While colonialism is the supposed connection between the two music genres, it is evident that latent or suppressed homosexuality of each character exists, otherwise a female actor would have been cast, as either the vampire or Sammie, in this male-dominated cast."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is a breathtaking fusion of supernatural horror, historical drama, and cultural commentary, making it one of the most compelling films of the decade. Set in 1930s Mississippi, the film immerses viewers in a world where music is magic, vampires lurk in the shadows, and the past refuses to stay buried.At the heart of Sinners is Michael B. Jordan, delivering a career-defining performance in a dual role as twin brothers Smoke and Stack. The two return from Chicago with dreams of opening a juke joint, but their ambitions collide with a sinister force embodied by Remmick (Jack O'Connell), a vampire who feeds on both music and human souls. Jordan's portrayal of the twins is mesmerizing-each brother is distinct, with their own motivations and emotional depth, proving once again his ability to command the screen.The film's atmosphere is intoxicating, thanks to Coogler's meticulous direction and Ludwig Göransson's haunting score, which blends blues, gospel, and jazz to create an immersive soundscape. The cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw captures the oppressive heat and eerie beauty of the Deep South, while the production design and costumes transport audiences to a time of racial tension and artistic revolution.Supporting performances shine as well- Hailee Steinfeld's Mary is both tragic and terrifying, Wunmi Mosaku's Annie brings emotional weight, and Miles Caton's Sammie serves as the film's beating heart. The ensemble cast ensures that every character feels fully realized, adding layers to the film's exploration of survival, resistance, and sacrifice.Unlike traditional vampire films, Sinners takes a slow-burn approach, allowing tension to simmer before erupting into gorgeously choreographed chaos. The horror is not just in the bloodshed but in the betrayals, impossible choices, and the lingering specter of racism.Coogler has crafted a cinematic masterpiece that is as horrifying as it is heartbreaking. Sinners is a film that demands to be seen on the big screen, offering a rich, layered narrative that lingers long after the credits roll."

I just spent a few minutes scrolling through all of the 2025 releases - and there are some really good ones coming out (one we've been waiting on for 28 years!) - and I have no idea how any of those movies will be able to top what I just watched. I thought Ryan Coogler peaked with Black Panther, but this movie blew me away. As soon as the movie ended, we agreed that we absolutely could have stayed and watched it again immediately after. No doubt we will go back to see it in the theaters again, then buy and watch many times at home.Based on the weird concoction of a premise, I went in expecting a 6/10 with a double dose of eye candy, but it was an absolute 10/10. I watch lots and lots of movies every year, from B movies to blockbusters, so my taste is all over the place.I won't get into the actual movie cause lots of other people did. So, just go and see it!"

However, things start to change when a supernatural presence notices the small club. I don't want to spoil anything, as I think it is better to go in without knowing anything about the film. I wish I hadn't even seen the trailer, as it spoils a few plot points. However, it's a brilliant film that keeps you entertained and guessing the entire time. And make sure you stay until the end, as I thought the midcredit ending was amazing! The cinematography was excellent, and every shot was beautiful. There are some amazing-looking scenes, and the music is great. The acting is top-notch. Michael B. Jordan is simply amazing in not one but two different roles. Hailee Steinfeld also steals the show as Mary. Hailee Steinfeld is what interested me in this film, as she is one of my favorite actors. However, she has done much lately, so it was nice seeing her acting again, even if it was a small role. She can deliver every line brilliantly, even if they seem over the top or crude. She also has amazing chemistry with Michael B. Jordan. I just wish we got to see her character explored a little more. If I'm being really critical, there were times when the Vampires seemed a little dumb. Also, subtitles would have been really nice, especially in the first half of the movie, as some of the characters were hard to understand with their thick Southern accents, and the music was a little too loud over the dialogue at times. It's also not suitable for kids, but adults should be fine. However, I like the idea that there are different versions of \"sinners\" and different kinds of monsters in the world. Overall, it was a great time at the movies with an original idea that felt fresh and new. I'd highly recommend it for Hailee Steinfeld alone."

There's a back story to Jordan's character but you need to find out for yourself. Above all this is by far one of the most original movies to come out in years. Jack O Connell is scary here as the antagonist but even he is one of the lesser surprises. There's some decent scares and thrills here in a little bit over two hours. What sucks is this might end up being steamed in a few weeks which takes away from how this movie should be seen. On an epic big screen theater with quality surround audio.

          "content": "\"Sinners\" is a feature film written and directed by Ryan Coogler (the \"Creed\" franchise, \"Black Panther\" 1 & 2, \"Fruitvale Station\".The main gist of the plot involves twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan), \"Smoke\" and \"Stack\", who return to their home community in Clarksdale Mississippi to start a nightclub. Respected and feared as war veterans and racketeers (a throwaway line alleges that they worked for Al Capone, but it's never elaborated upon), Smoke and Stack have arrived in town with a truck full of beer and wine stolen from Irish and Italian mob factions in Chicago. They hurriedly purchase an abandoned sawmill from a local white man-- who may or may not be part of the Ku Klux Klan-- then the twins go to work recruiting singers, cooks and guards for the soon-to-be-named \"Club Juke\".A younger cousin, Sammie (Miles Caton) is the son of the local pastor for the black community, and an elderly bluesman Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) is also in tow. Along the way, former lovers of the twins show up (Hailee Steinfeld as Mary and Wunmi Mosaku as Annie) and their presence hints at some of the danger to come.Jack O'Connell is the lead villain, the vampire Remmick. He enters the film on the run from Native American vampire hunters; soon he has tricked a local white couple and increases the people under his thrall.The vampires are reportedly drawn to Club Juke because of the music being played. Reportedly, Sammie and Delta Slim are talented enough where their music goes beyond the Earthly plane in its reach, to the \"spirit world\", and so does malevolence find itself drawn to blues musicians and others of their sort.The rest of the cast is solid, including Li Jun Li as Grace, one of the towns few Asian-American residents. Her particular fantasy during an extended musical interlude (conjuring images of the past, present and future) is intriguing.Once the vampire action gets underway, the pace of the film doesn't let up. The townsfolk stuck inside the nightclub aren't trained vampire hunters, they can only rely on tips and tricks offered by Annie, and the firepower and combat readiness of a few others.One obvious touchstone for this movie is the Robert Rodriguez feature \"From Dusk Til Dawn\". Similarly, a smallish group of people found themselves under siege by a much larger group of vampires in an isolated location. The HBO series \"Lovecraft Country\" is also just as important to consider: its narrative also followed Black American protagonists in the Jim Crow era who were stalked by supernatural forces. Especially in the aftermath of Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\", any number of horror film and television projects have brought black actors more into the forefront as protagonists, whereas in the past, black people were either invisible from the stories or convenient early victims of the menace.Much of the narrative ponders the connection between blues music, Black American trauma, the American assimilation politics reserved for some but not for others, the temptations of a quick solution for marginalized peoples yielding unintended consequences, and more.Vampirism is envisioned here as a version of racialized trauma and a spinoff of the oppression that America's people of color have faced since the beginnings of the country. For the protagonists in this film, predators lurk in the periphery always, but most don't have fangs and don't have the limitations of only being around at night.Definitely a worthy vampire film. Had this been done simply as a period drama exploring the brutality of the Jim Crow era without the vampire-fantasy aspect, it could have worked as well. But that Coogler's story to tell involved creatures of the night possibly helped him secure financing from a major studio.After seeing this movie, one can easily argue that Ryan Coogler is the perfect candidate to reboot Marvel Studios' \"Blade the Vampire Hunter\" franchise."

          "content": "**Sinners** is a blood-soaked symphony of chaos, a supernatural rollercoaster that plunges you into the heart of the Mississippi Delta in 1932. Directed by Ryan Coogler, this film is a love letter to the blues, the undead, and the unbreakable bonds of family. Think *The Lost Boys* meets *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*, with a dash of gothic horror and a whole lot of bite.The story follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan), who return to their hometown to open a juke joint, only to find themselves battling a clan of vampires led by the sinister Remmick (Jack O'Connell). The film's atmosphere is electric, with haunting visuals and a soundtrack that feels like it was pulled straight from the soul of the Delta. The characters are as vibrant as the neon lights of the juke joint, with standout performances from Hailee Steinfeld as Mary and newcomer Miles Caton as Sammie, the blues prodigy whose music becomes both a weapon and a curse.The action is relentless, the stakes (pun intended) are high, and the dialogue crackles with wit and grit. Coogler masterfully blends horror, history, and heart, creating a film that feels both timeless and fresh. The vampires are terrifying yet tragically human, their fangs sinking into themes of oppression, resilience, and redemption.And just when you think the ride is over, the post-credits scene hits you like a sucker punch. Decades after the events of the film, an older Sammie, now a legendary blues musician, encounters Stack and Mary, who haven't aged a day. They offer him immortality, but Sammie, ever the soulful rebel, declines. Instead, he picks up his guitar and plays a tune that echoes with the pain and beauty of a life well-lived. It's a hauntingly poetic coda that leaves the door wide open for a sequel.*Sinners* is a feast for the senses and a stake through the heart of conventional vampire tales. It's dark, it's daring, and it's downright unforgettable. If you're looking for a film that'll make your blood race and your soul sing, this is it."

Fortunately Sinners ended up living up to the hype almost.Sinners does fall into the trap of having multiple plot holes and clichés riddled throughout, but it is so well made in terms of how it is filmed that it's hard not to be immediately captivated by the story Ryan Coogler has created. In a time where almost every new big film release is a remake or sequel, an original film like Sinners feels so refreshing and rare.From the breathtaking cinematography to the almost euphoric score, Sinners feels fresh and at the same time very old school almost like something that would've came out back in the early 90s. While it won't be the best film of 2025, I had a fantastic time watching it which at the end of the day is why we go to the movies."

One of my favorite performances came from Mr. Delroy Lindo as Slim his acting chops gives him one of the most riveting scenes in the movie. Coogler's casting is what makes the movie so strong Jack O Connell sells his role as the villain so well you forget he's only playing a role. The cast left no fat. Only take away that wasn't a positive was the runtime. I didn't check my watch but any two hours movie you will feel it. I urge you to stay through the credits.

Jordan delivers a compelling performance in a dual role as twin brothers grappling with their haunted pasts. As they return to their hometown seeking redemption, they are met not with solace but an unspeakable evil that has taken root in the place they once called home.The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, slowly drawing viewers into its dark, eerie setting. While the initial build-up may test some viewers' patience, it effectively sets the stage for the horror that ensues.

Ludwig Göransson's score intermittently shines, particularly in key suspenseful moments, adding layers to the film's chilling ambiance.However, Sinners isn't without its drawbacks. The slow start might alienate viewers looking for immediate thrills, and while the horror elements are well-executed, they tread familiar ground without offering new frights.Overall, Sinners is a well-crafted horror adventure that will satisfy fans of the genre with its stylistic period detail and psychological depth. It's a film that proves effective at evoking dread and delivers a solid, if not groundbreaking, cinematic experience.Rating: 8\nA solid addition to the horror genre, Sinners offers a darkly intriguing look at the past, driven by strong performances and atmospheric tension."

His eye for casting alone is solid, as he collects a cast of quality actors to make this cultural film feel sincere and authentic. Michael B. Jordan's double roles feel well-designed as the brothers hold enough differences to feel different despite it being the same actor. The chemistry between the crew is good at many times, this \"family\" is filled with plenty of members to make the den of Sinners have engaging stories to tell. In their hands, Coogler's dialogue has a lot of emotional power behind it, each character wielding the old-time dialogue like a weapon that caters to each person. Blunt insults, velvety-smooth seduction, confused states of mind, and more, all loaded into what almost feels like a melting pot of textbook topics, all mixed with a Hollywood budget.Past the acting, Sinners is loaded with a lot of elements that are going to appeal to the modern-day audience. The cinematography is gorgeous, filters being used at the right times to grant the classic feeling until the \"good\" stuff starts to happen. His use of dark and light establishes moods that play with your concept of safety while also eliciting emotions for the sinful side of humanity. It holds haunting close-ups of those demonic eyes that are uncomfortable and not too overdone. When combined with the graphical content of their CGI work and the makeup, the visuals unleash the horror spectacle I think fans are going for, an unapologetic epoch of violence that pulls a lot of power with it. This especially becomes true during the action-packed finale, where the emotion hits a peak and unleashes the building tension to levels that sort of symbolize the various sins that run our lives. A sense of justice comes from much of this film, Coogler gives it style and pizazz without traipsing into the in-your-face antics that many choose to pursue. Even in the music, Coogler artistically has his team pour the same emotion into their scores, powerful ballads of the various styles etching their way into the setting to serve as an emotional narrator. The Blues is much of the film's bread and butter, but several other styles leak in, including an awesome rock ballad that blows the roof of the theater during the finish.And bringing everything together is a story that holds the same Coogler brand of character-centric focus. Sinners is not just a tale of two gangster brothers as you might get from the tag line, but something more, as each brother has different connections to the people around them. A spiderweb of complex relationships that are combinations of sinful studies, cultural awareness, and the crazy macabre material thrown in between. Sinners' characters have a lot of meat to them, stakes that go beyond a simple quality, and stakes that had me hoping some would survive. It only makes the ending that much more satisfying in the justice it brings. Overall, all of these qualities add up to an atmosphere that Coogler is so good at bringing, now extending his work to the Horror genre.DISLIKES:\nThe Language\nThe Excessive Gore\nThe Pacing\nThe Odd End Credit Component\nMore Development\nNot Scary\nAbstract To A Fault?Summary:\nWhere the movie lacks for me is ironically tied to some components of Coogler's atmosphere and the risks he took to make this movie stand out. Those risks did pay off for many components, but at times did crash for me when they became too much. For one thing, the language is not my cup of tea. Sinners is culturally relevant and accurate, but hearing some of my trigger words multiple times loses any fun and tactics for the simple realism card to let such stale writing. Excessive gore then turned me away, the first dregs horrifying, but then grew excessive and cheesy that I felt some of the focus became unnecessary and simply shock factor. Past my sensitivities, Sinners also didn't feel scary for the most part, the horror elements becoming drowned in the aforementioned gore and character subplots, with the true horror being the hyperbolic personalities. Where I feel the main elements I disliked come down to the pacing conflicting with the unique director's approach. Sinners' first hour is a lot of exposition and complex storytelling, each character getting recruited into this ordeal and trying to dig into each person's reason for existing. Then the second hour happens and the pacing speeds up tenfold, the character elements there, but now feeling much shallower and hastened to the ending. It lacks the same composure, and so much is happening by the last forty minutes that I felt so many characters were robbed of their full dramatic exposition, especially the finish to the action scenes that were cut. More development felt needed, or perhaps it would have been better not to have so much exposition to give a more engaging second half to test them. When the end credits happen, this oddness continues, a sort of half fake-out that feels like a forced bookend that is fulfilling with the poetic dialogue, but again could have been placed better for me. As for the story itself, all those elements battling for supremacy are not quite as organized as I like, and the whole macabre aspect feels highly unnecessary, weird, and at times kind of dumb despite the other elements it brought. I liked. I don't know how to describe it, but that element just felt ambiguous and too out there, perhaps for a film study to decipher.The VERDICT\nSinners is something unique and dynamic that the cinema world has been missing for some time. Under a strong director, the elements of action, horror, drama, and cultural history manage to work well together on multiple fronts and create this very memorable story. Coogler's use of strong visual elements and musical scores adds to this atmosphere that feels welcome in a title of Sinners, but doesn't get too lost in those elements to feel like a documentary. It's got strong acting, good characters, and relevant topics in every number as it marches to a progression towards an endgame that seems quite open. Such art is hard to balance, but for me, Coogler has done a lot of things right. Yet, the movie once again feels trapped by the run time with a pace that is very uneven between exposition, horror, and thrills. Perhaps he tried to do this higher level of storytelling too much, the risks paying off in most elements, but a sensical story and proper attention to the bevy of characters. Sure, it's complete, and there are only a of ambiguous elements to keep the story open, but this odd horror element doesn't feel executed perfectly when it's as weird as it is, especially without the scares. When I sort all of this out, Sinners is a movie that is very much a theater-worthy installment with the most targeted audience being cultural audiences, horror elements from an artistic side, and those who love a good metaphor-heavy film to write essays on. My scores are:Action/Drama/Horror/Thriller: 7.5-8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0."

It didn't exactly have the ending that I'd hoped for, but it was one that I was very, very satisfied with. Especially, where there is this one scene in the movie that combines several traits of past present and future altogether into something that honestly feels like it hasn't even been invented yet until now. But the bottom line is, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie to the end. It's violent, it's dangerous, and it's something else."

          "content": "\"Horror\" about vampires with a hint of western?This is what it is (in my opinion) - Ryan Coogler's latest film. A director and screenwriter who has titles such as Black Panther or Creed. This time he takes us to Louisiana, where he tells the story of two twin brothers - Elijah and Elias Smoke (both played by Michael B. Jordan), who after years spent in gangster Chicago return to their hometown to cut themselves off from the past and start all over again.The brothers plan to open a bar where their black community could have fun and feel safe. To do this, they buy back an old sawmill from a former Ku Klux Klan member and begin to gather a team. They visit their cousin Sammi Moore (Miles Caton), a brilliant blues guitarist, and legendary pianist Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo). A pair of local shopkeepers - Bo (Yao) and Grace (Li Jun Li) Chow, and a powerful friend working on a nearby plantation, who is supposed to keep order, also join. Elijah's former partner Annie (Wunmi Mosaku) also appears, and the brothers are followed by Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), with whom Elias had an affair.Everything promises to be beautiful - there is fun, music, people are going crazy and drinking. Everything changes when three strange white people show up who want to join the party. The brothers refuse them, thanks to which they save the lives of many people, that strangers turn out to be vampires. Their goal is to capture Sammie and from that moment the heroes must survive until dawn.At the outset, I would like to point out: I would not call this film a horror - at least not the first half of it. It can be described as an atmospheric drama with a clear note of an ending western, because the action takes place around the middle of the 19th century, and the whole is accompanied by brilliant music that gives this film soul and charm. Only the second part turns into a horror movie - then we have blood, action and of course vampires. But don't expect here who knows what - there will be a couple of jump scares, but this is not their main asset.Michael B. Deserves great praise. Jordan playing two completely different characters and he does it really well. The music is mainly blues, it creates an amazing atmosphere. Unfortunately, there is one moment that knocks out a bit - during the party the music turns into a strange mix of jazz and contemporary hip-hop, which completely does not fit the rest of the film and seems totally random and gives the impression that the creator could not decide which way this film should go. Fortunately, it takes a short time.Of the minuses, I can also count some of the murder scenes, which look just kitschy. Blood is more like red paint than a special effect, vampires are sometimes more grotesque than scary, and at times they can actually cause anxiety, but due to this lack of tonal consistency, you can see that the creator did not quite know which way he wanted to go.To sum up - it's a really good movie that had great potential. In my opinion, it could be even better if the story went in a slightly different direction, maybe even without vampires. The acting is at a very high level, the music builds a great atmosphere, and despite a few mishaps and unnecessary treatments - this is a film that is definitely worth going to the cinema."

Michael plays twin brothers named Smoke and Stack, who have been in Chicago working with Al Capone in the 1930's. After 7 years, Michael decides that they should move back to their hometown in Mississippi to start their own Juke Joint-aka club-so they enlist some of their old friends to put it all together. Michael buys a plot of land with an old warehouse on it from the local KKK. Delroy is a blues musician, Miles is one of their cousins that wants to be a blues musician-he plays a mean guitar-and Hailee is an old girlfriend. Things are going pretty good until Jack shows up and wants to party with them. Michael and friends soon discover that Jack is a vampire and the siege begins. Remember, vampires have to be invited into a building or they can not enter, but Jack rapidly starts adding to his flock when people start trying to escape. There is a scene right after the end credits start and another one at the very end.It's rated R for bloody violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes.If you liked From Dusk Till Dawn, you should enjoy this one-2 brothers against vampires. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray."

Coogler can take his seat alongside Spielberg and Scorcesee as far as I'm concerned.This movie engaged me, entertained me and I was never bored. The title \"sinners\" is appropos because of all the sin and wrongdoing that the characters do even though their personalities charm you over. I never expected the Vampire rampage segment. However, the story has a 180 turn that makes it make sense. Two twins originally from Mississippi return after living in the north with a stash of cash. It's hinted that they stole from Al Capone, all we know is that the money is not \"earned.\" With that money they open a Mississippi juke joint and on opening night all the demons come out. I'll leave you at that. The casting was perfect, many of the actors were unknown to me and they embodied their characters perfectly."

They want to set up a new bar. Their cousin Sammie leaves his pastor father for the day to play music in the new spot. Things are not all as they seem as 3 visitors come with dark intentions.That's all of the plot I want to say because it's a movie you should experience IN THE CINEMA. It's a movie enriched in culture, the message I took from the movie even though these black people are not slaves they won't be free, this life they will never be free and it's powerful.There is a lot more of that culture that doesn't truly resonate with me or maybe connect is a better word, that can't take away from the writing, acting, and path of this movie. The music is a massive feature utilised extremely well, the only party was the past present future but that eh not for me, could have done without.The vampires were GREAT, my favourite part of the movie ! The eyes !!! The teeth, the whisper and haunting nature is great.The pace, right it seems good but kind of switches about 3/4 of the way, I feel the major vampire bits took a while to get to and that's fine but the payoff was too fast I believe.Overall a good take on the lore, great build, recommend seeing, 8/10."

          "content": "9/10. Sinners comes in a southern baked blend of fantastic filmmaking, part gangster drama, a celebration of the blues, deep fried action, Michael B. Jordan smoking double stacks, and bloody Vampire horror.(I might give this a 10/10 later. I give those to very few films and need to soak this cinematic experience in.)Finally! We have a contender for one of the best movies of 2025. Exhilarating and a great solid ride. I really enjoyed this film.Ryan Coogler (Black Panther, Creed) deftly blends genres packaged together in this horror flick. Organically, Coogler gives the musical past of the blues a huge shoutout and weaves it into a vampire horror set in the backdrop of a gritty, 1930's Mississippi. Racism and family are big themes underlined with dark humor and religion. The story is a pair of twins come back to their hometown to set up a new life and leave the past behind. But supernatural entities will mess up those plans to cause chaos and blood.Coogler finally has room to breath to direct his artistic, visual filmmaking. No constraints and no MCU baggage. He gives us an original film with his confident, patient, and visually spectacular directing. He patiently builds up the film. At first it seems like a gritty, dirty, period piece with gangsters, racism, and money. Then he intertwines blues music. Then veers into the more creepy, scary vibe. Then goes into the vampire territory intertwined with more blues music, violence, and blood. Yes, this is also his love letter to blues music. It is important because the hip hop, rock, and heavy metal landscape would have looked vastly different without the blues. He balances everything out while some of the characters are dealing with the messed-up Jim Crow laws of the south.Coogler utilizes IMAX film and Ultra Panavision 70mm film to capture everything. Even Christopher Nolan helped him with the process. I love that great filmmakers such as Ryan Coogler, Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Quentin Tarantino, and Paul Thomas Anderson use old school film stock to create memorable films. Proves that physical film and media isn't dead.(I'm still pissed that Best Buy stopped carrying physical movies and Target at their stores. But that is just me.)Michael B. Jordan (Creed 3, Black Panther, Space Jam 2) help carry the film with his dual role. He plays the twins very distinctly and a phenomenal job at differentiating the two. If you don't know who he is, then you would have thought he was actual twins. He really should be nominated an Oscar for this. He brings charm and old school wit to the screen. He brings the sledgehammer and bullets to vampires and the evil, orange tinted frame of the KKK.The beautiful Hailee Steinfield (Hawkeye, True Grit) fits in very well with the rest of the cast. I'm ignoring the fact of my Kansas City Chiefs being rivals with the Buffalo Bills. She did a wonderful job. But who is Miles Caton? He did a heck of an excellent job in his acting debut. Young dude has bright future in acting and music. The rest of the cast is solid and they do a great job.The music through the IMAX sound system is breathtaking. Again, Ludwig killed it with the soundtrack. I loved that heavy metal is included in some of the movie. But hearing the blues blaring loud and awesome with the unique camera angles needs to be heard on the big screen. Arkapaw's cinematography is beautiful, dirty, and terrifying.Go see this on the biggest screen possible. Sure, the third act goes into cliché territory some and part of the logic at the end is questionable. But we have a solid, original film not relying on soulless, corporate IP stuff. This film has soul, heart, and blood splatter.Yes, stay throughout the entire credits..\nLet's take a small look at what my CMRU (Cinematic Movie Reviewing Universe) thought:-Me: \"Let's keep this short, respectful, and simple.\"-Mrs. Fleabag: \"Woohoo! Everything about this film slayed. Yes, one of my favorites! 10/10.\"-Cool Bob (Fleabag, Earth 2): \"Ryan Coogler and Ludwig Göransson music go together like peanut butter and jelly. 10/10.\"-K. Oner (with a 40 oz in his hand): \"Yeah, that blues music had me dancing and toe tapping all over! 9/10.\"-Dirt Stan: \"Yeah, your drink went everywhere. This film actually made me happy for once. Just epic. 9/10.\"-Mrs. Licker: \"I was not expecting this from a Twilight prequel. 9/10.\"-Me: \"Uh, almost got through this normally. Ok, that will wrap it up.\"The End."

          "content": "Sinners has been one of the most talked-about films lately, especially after reaching an impressive 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Maybe that's why I walked in with very high expectations. The truth is, while I can see its qualities, I left the cinema with mixed feelings. This is a film with something to say, but it often feels stuck between what it wants to be and what it actually delivers.The story takes a long time to get going. For about an hour and twenty minutes, we follow the daily lives of twin brothers, both played by Michael B. Jordan. His performance is solid and charismatic, but I often found it hard to tell the characters apart - they look and act so similarly that it caused some confusion. During this first part, there's very little tension, and the promise of horror slowly fades away in a series of dialogues and social interactions. These scenes touch on important themes like racism, slavery, and cultural heritage, but for viewers expecting action and horror, this section might feel slow and directionless.The big issue is that Sinners presents itself as a vampire film - but for most of its runtime, it seems to forget that. Only in the final third does the horror really arrive. Visually, those scenes are well executed, with solid CGI, nice camera work, and carefully planned night-time lighting. But even then, everything feels predictable and lacks emotional impact. The film seems unsure whether it wants to be a deep psychological story or a bloody horror flick, and by trying to be a bit of both, it doesn't fully commit to either.Surprisingly, the best moment comes after the credits. The post-credits scene is a gem - smart, bold, and with a twist that actually made me want to see more. Honestly, they could have cut 30 minutes from the main film and developed that twist instead. It's one of the best post-credits scenes I've seen in recent years, and a real lesson for studios like Marvel, which have made this format feel repetitive and pointless.In comparison, Sinners could have followed a more mature path like Let the Right One In or even Get Out - films that use horror to explore deep human issues or strong social commentary. Instead, it ends up somewhere between social critique and generic entertainment, and misses the chance to stand out.In the end, Sinners is entertaining and touches on important historical topics, but it doesn't fully deliver on the promise of thrilling horror or a truly gripping story. I enjoyed parts of it, but I doubt it'll stay in my memory as a standout in the genre."

However, the movie quickly loses its grip. The villain felt like an afterthought with no real backstory or motivation, which made the conflict feel hollow. The frequent musical numbers were oddly placed and, at times, more annoying than engaging. The finale tried to be profound but felt bizarre and out of place. I left the theater more confused than satisfied.Please don't let the reviews trick you; sadly, you will walk out of the movie very disappointed."

Now that I've seen it, I can easily say that it blew my expectations out of the water. The story, the characters, the MUSIC. Everything was masterful. Coogler's use of aspect ratio changes made seeing it in IMAX all the difference and I highly recommend others see it that way too. Not only for the way this movie was beautifully shot, but you want those IMAX speakers blasting the incredible score right into your ears. 'Sinners' is a terrifying beautiful fable and absolutely one of my new top favorite movies of all time; and I want everyone to see it."

We don't get a lot of original content nowadays that isn't already tied to a franchise or existing IP so thank you Ryan Coogler for creating something artful with a story of its own. Admittedly, the protagonist \"Preacher Boy\" sparked immediate comparisons for me to urban legend blues man archetypes like Robert Johnson but stands out in how this character's story is told. It feels personal. It feels inspired and I was along for the ride. For me, Sinners is the live action version of an Ernie Barnes painting, particularly \"The Sugar Shack\", and I am so here for bringing back such depictions of Black life and art. There is a powerfully moving juke joint scene that motivates the darker themes of the film while simultaneously shining in pushing both narrative and nostalgia. It weaves ancestry and anarchy masterfully. And it proves why we need more black creators in the supernatural horror genre! Michael B. Jordan is getting the well deserved attention for his performances but I would argue to say that this is an ensemble effort where everyone sunk their teeth into their respective roles. Final thought: If From Dusk Till Dawn, Idlewild, & Eve's Bayou had a one night stand they would conceive Twins called Smoke & Stacks."

Despite being watchable, I still felt disappointed especially after all the positive ratings.First off, it starts very slowly, and gives the vibes of a Gangster drama/Musical. So the first hour or so is wasted in a dull build up, introducing to us a number of different characters, too many to count, and perhaps that's one of the many negatives of the film, there is no main character. The trailer makes you believe its all about the twins, but then there is the younger musician. Who's the main character here ?Too many characters and interpersonal relationships thrown at us within an hour, all very drama driven with some light humor. Then comes the musical numbers that come up and interrupts the flow. Granted, some good old fashioned tunes that mimics the Blues of the past but what's the point ?The movie then takes another turn trying to discuss serious political and racial issues, trying to deliver a message that i didn't get, just adds to the complexity of the film.Finally the part i was waiting for arrives, the action, horror and thrills. Unfortunately, it falls flat and lacks the tension or excitement i was hoping for. Some unexplained loop holes that ruins the plot and the action sequences, like the monsters asking permission to enter the building, among other unexplained finer details.This whole part reminded me of a similar film From Dusk till Dawn.In Summary, this films lacks focus and wants to be everything, a gangster film, a drama, a musical, a horror with too many characters squeezed in.Its watchable, mainly because of the art direction and capturing the period of the 1930s Mississippi perfectly. In terms of entertainment and plot, it lacks big time and I don't recommend it."

Being Black is profoundly represented in Sinners. There are so many layers, endless layers : religion, music, slavery, racism, colonialism, vaudou and it's all real. Past or future it existed, it exists and it always will. We exist, we always have and we will always will no matter how much we're hated for it. Sinners is CULTURE, African culture, African American culture both perfectly understood and respected. I saw my African culture in there, from West Africa. Right next to African American culture, do you know how insane and rare that is ? To see us there as one ? That scene had me crying and levitating because yes, from one continent to the other we are all connected. It's just a spiritual matter to find the right way to see it.I'm so grateful to have witnessed such greatness. I can die in peace now. I feel the same peace I felt when I first watched SNK but this is more intimate, it's deeper, it's personal, its me and all those who came before me.For those who don't get it it's okay. I believe this is for a specific demographic, a very very specific one. The ones who'd have done what Sammie did : leave religion behind. Sinners is a clear cut : either you're it and you feel it or you're not and you don't. I still need to process the greatness I just experienced. The parallels, all the topics I can talk about in this masterpiece are endless. Endless. But all in all I'm glad that there's someone out there who's able to put everything I feel into a movie. Thank you so much for sharing your work Ryan Coogler. You are divinely gifted and you transcend the realms of the past, the present and the future. This is insanity."

          "content": "'Sinners', the film written and directed by Ryan Coogler will be interpreted in different ways by different categories of viewers. It is a horror film with and about vampires. It is a period film set in the American South in 1932, a year of the Great Depression. It is a political film about racial discrimination, the history and suffering of the African-American community. It is a drama with spiritual overtones about the moral corruption of money and the saving power of each person. For me, 'Sinners' is first and foremost a film about music, about the blues and its roots in history and suffering. It is a film with music, with a lot of exceptional music (two CDs were released on the day of the film's release) composed in part by Ludwig Göransson with the rest extracted from the treasury of American music. The quality and intensity of the music elevate this film in my eyes, even if I was less impressed by many other aspects of this production.The story takes place in the Mississippi River Delta in 1932, in the southern United States hit by the economic recession to which is added the racial discrimination that sometimes takes the violent forms of the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. Theoretically we are still in the Prohibition period, but alcohol seems to be available in abundance. Brothers Smoke and Stark return from Chicago where they made good money, probably as associates in the world of gangsters and drug dealers. Their families, friends and childhood sweethearts seem frozen in time and in their poverty, while the brothers drive a luxury car and pay with stacks of dollars. The two buy from a white farmer a barn, which during a cinematic day they will transform into a dance hall with bar where alcohol is served and blues music is played. Among those recruited to help them is the young Sammie, son of a Protestant minister and exceptional bluesman. The desire to recover lost time and perhaps the innocence of youth runs into multiple obstacles - from racism to the appearance of unusual phenomena. The descendants of the first Indian inhabitants of the region have become vampires and decided to attack right now. At nightfall, when the party begins, the strangest events are triggered.The film has two parts that seemed stronger to me. One of them is the evocation of the historical era and the place where the story takes place - the American South where legends melt into magic, where blues is born from pain, where rebellion and violence constantly smolder and when they break out they seem to have no limits. If it weren't for the vampire story, 'Sinners' could have been an excellent social drama, perhaps even violent à la Tarantino. It was the action part that seemed less successful to me, too long and quite confusing at times. However, fans of this genre of films may be satisfied, because from one moment on, blood flows in abundance, rivaled only by alcohol. The moral message seemed to me to be annihilated by the violence on screen. The fact that Michael B. Jordan plays the dual role of the two twin brothers doesn't really help in my opinion. The special effects are successful, but honestly, I didn't really distinguish the personalities of the two brothers except by the color of their hats. The quality is given by the music, the other major quality of the film. I read that the character Sammie (interpreted by Miles Caton) was inspired by the biography of the legendary bluesman Robert Johnson, who was said to have made a pact with the devil in exchange of his talent as a musician. I confirm that the music in 'Sinners' sounds magical. This is one of those cases in which the musical soundtrack has a chance to remain in the audiences' memory for a longer time than the film."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler has had a very impressive filmmaking career, starting with the independent film \"Fruitvale Station\" before transitioning to mainstream franchise films such as \"Black Panther\" and the \"Creed\" series--while still maintaining a high level of quality and commitment to compelling storytelling. His new film \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also a lot more than that. It can also be convincingly called a historical period piece, a music-related drama, and to some extent even a gangster film. The film doesn't always succeed at its tonal shifts, but it's still a well-crafted film that is far better than most mainstream genre films released today.The film tells the story of two brothers, Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan,) in Mississippi in the 1930s. They've returned home from Chicago and are planning to open a juke joint where locals can dance their hearts out to blues music. But eventually, some uninvited guests show up, and plenty of blood is spilled. There's a lot to like about this film, particularly its aesthetic excellence and outstanding blues score. The cinematography, particularly wide shots of driving around cotton fields in Mississippi and at the juke joint itself, is excellent. And the blues music is absolutely sublime, helping contribute to the atmosphere of each scene in which it is featured. Those qualities merge with each other in a stunning scene about halfway in the film showing large crowds dancing and enjoying the newly opened juke joint for the evening. It also helps that Michael B. Jordan gives two compelling (and very charismatic) performances.But when the film shifts towards horror in the second half, the profundity and clever world-building in the first half is put on the back burner. For me, that didn't totally work. People who enjoy horror films will likely feel a bit differently. I didn't find the descent into pulpy thrills to feel even with the first half, unlike other films with stark tonal shifts such as \"Parasite.\" Despite the unevenness, there's no denying the strong qualities on screen in \"Sinners,\" or the fact that Coogler is clearly a talented filmmaker. Recommended. 7.5/10."

Irish beer and whiskey flow like they've got something to prove, and the only color that counts is red-red from neon, red from tail lights in the swamp fog, red from what spills when tempers run long and patience runs short.You're deep in the Deep South now, where cotton-picking families drift in from nowhere, sweat on their backs and dreams in their eyes, looking for a place to forget the hard days and remember who they are. They find it in the juke joints-low-lit sanctuaries where the music don't just play, it haunts. Guitars moan like heartache, horns cry for the lost, and pianos bleed under the weight of too many memories.And just when you think you've got the setup-bootleggers, the Klan, mob men with gold rings and guns under the table-the night takes a turn.They don't knock. They slip in. Vampires.Not the cape-and-coffin kind. These ones wear charm like a second skin, sing like angels soaked in sin. They wait, coiled and calm, for that one thing they need-a welcome. Once they get it, it's over. Their songs drip sweet and slow, pulling you in like molasses in July, and before you know it, you're dancing with death and asking for another round.The performances? Electric. Every player locked in like a bullet in the chamber. Direction so tight you could cut glass on it. The whole thing hums with tension-where fantasy fuses with hard history, and the past feels too close for comfort."

          "content": "Absolute cinema! Ryan Coogler delivered a masterpiece to us on a silver platter. What was one of the sleeper films of the year has now become my favorite and most highly-regarded for 2025.The story, the characters, their relationships, the set design, the cinematography, the shots, the sound design, the soundtrack, the directing, the pacing, the balancing of tones, the worldbuilding, the costumes, the special effects, EVERYTHING was immaculate.The protagonist: Michael B Jordan was at the top of his game in this movie. And not only for one character, but two! He delivered the roles of Smoke and Stack in their own distinct ways despite the fact that they are identical twins with the same life story and similar, if not the same, motivations and goals. His portrayal of the twins was charismatic, fun, tragic, relatable, and captivating.The spouses: Hailee Steinfeld really shows off her acting chops in this film, from horrific to heartbreaking. I feel like a lot of people sleep on her abilities as an actor. Wunmi Mosaku's performance was powerful, brave, and devastating. Her journey across the film was so sad yet also uplifting. Both of these women played off of Jordan's roles in their own unique ways and had excellent chemistry together.The antagonist: What a performance from Jack O'Connell. He was menacing, charming, both warm and dark, and in moments even hopeful. His character was so complex and layered with rich subtext and history. Coogler really did a wonderful job on creating the character and choosing O'Connell to fill the roll.The newcomer: Let's give a huge round of applause to Miles Caron, who played the true hero of the story, Sammie Moore. This was the actor's debut and my goodness was this an impactful first step into cinema. I look forward to his works in the future.The rest of the supporting cast also deserves their flowers, as each character is unique and stands out from one another. Each have their own moments throughout the film that give them depth and meaning to their part in the story.Overall, this movie did an amazing job at balancing period drama with vampire horror and sprinkles of drama, romance, and comedy throughout. Nothing felt forced and everything moment of screen time had purpose. I can't recommend enough that you see this film in theaters, as I believe this will remain as one of the top films of the year when all is said and done.Ryan Coogler, in my opinion, is now rubbing shoulders with the current great writer/directors in film, the same pool of creatives as Denis Villeneueve, Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, and Bong Joon Ho.I cannot stress this enough: this movie was perfect. 10/10."

You can almost smell the sweat and smoke of Mississippi in the 1930s. It's Southern Gothic with swagger.And the music - it's not just background. It moves the film. That blues-gospel fusion didn't just set the tone, it told the story. Ludwig Göransson's score hits deep, especially when paired with scenes that unfold like slow poetry. You feel the tension build not with jump scares, but with rhythm, silence, and emotional weight.The gradual suspension is what really hooked me. The movie doesn't rush. It lets you sit with the unease, the mystery, the beauty and the blood. Every reveal feels earned. Every character - especially Michael B. Jordan playing both brothers - pulls you deeper into that world where music can save or curse you.It's bold. It's haunting. It's not perfect, but it doesn't need to be.This isn't just horror. It's art with fangs."

Sinners is at once a period piece, a long-form music video, a revenge flick (of sorts), and a horror movie with dramatic elements that flesh out \"two\" of the main characters, Smoke & Stack. It was taut with suspense, which buzzed with a low hum throughout the first act until we were introduced to our antagonist. It was a historical period piece which delved into Mississippi Black American culture from the 1930s. I firmly believe that Ryan Coogler is poised to be an iconic director on the strength of this movie. Not that his previous work wasn't good - it was. But he has, in my opinion, with this movie, cemented himself as the next in a line of storied and celebrated directors. I don't have the necessary cinema intellect to truly delve into what made this movie a great movie. As a 3rd generation born-free Black American (four generations removed from my slave ancestor Tony Williams), I appreciated the rich, vibrant Black world that he created with characters that had agency, emotions, power, and complexity - they were fully human - I saw my father, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, and aunt on the screen. This movie was incredible and the ending was satisfying. Stay until the last credits roll for two extra surprises which complete the meal. I look forward to watching it again with new eyes."

I think the drama element of this film was perfectly done and almost wish it stayed a drama and didn't take a bloody turn. The first half of this movie before the vampires were introduced was thoroughly entertaining, the characters were very vibrant and had some good dialogue between them all. Every time a new character was introduced the film kept building tension, keeping you engaged. Obviously having watched the trailer, I knew what was to come, but it wasn't executed well. This movie wasn't scary, and the vampires felt very out of place, it was difficult to understand the tone that the film was trying to portray. Since we had been quite dramatic and serious in the first half, bringing in the vampires didn't fit, they felt random and out of place and got you questioning are we meant to be taking this part of the film seriously or have we turned into a parody type of film. It felt like two separate movies and I think they should've kept the dramatic tone and kept that flowing throughout the film. I do not class this as a horror film, yes there's blood, gore and a couple of cheap jump scares but there was nothing horrifying about it, there was no dread or suspense it was all very comedic and I just failed to understand why the film was all these different genres in one."

Not to mention, the music was so perfect that it struck straight for my heart and manipulated my emotions. All I can say is that Coogler and B.

Instead of sticking to a singular plot or theme, we get a mishmash of randomness that is RIDDLED with plot holes and clichès.There were multiple scenes that never needed to be in the film, and many that should have been extended, it seemed to me that the film had fingers in every pie and kept on branching out to stories and plots that didn't really have meaning.That said, I didn't hate this film, it had its moments, but it also had plenty of flaws."

          "content": "I really enjoyed Sinners! By the second half of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat thanks to the suspenseful build-up. The cinematography was stunning throughout, and the jumpscares were timed just right - not overdone, but enough to keep you alert.The cast did an excellent job, especially Michael B. Jordan, who played both Smoke and Stack so distinctively that you could instantly tell them apart. Jack O'Connell was also great as Remmick the vampire, and Miles Caton as Sammie Moore was a perfect casting choice. His music and vocals were genuinely impressive, and the way the soundtrack was woven into the film made it even more immersive.If I had one critique, it would be that some of the dialogue was a bit hard to catch because of the heavy accents. Subtitles would've made it a lot easier to follow certain scenes.The mid and end-credit scenes were nice surprises too - definitely worth staying for. Ryan Coogler has impressed us yet again with this one!"

          "content": "Another great movie by Ryan Coogler. Michale B Jordon kills it in a dual role as twins as he carries so much of the movie bantering with himself. The rest of the side characters are great too, with special shout puts to Cornbread and Preacher's son. Great themes about sin, temptation, family, and perseverance. You get genuinely invested in the character drama before the awesome southern vampire action goes down. Which is incredibly tense and has a lot of fun utilizing vampire lore into such a different setting with the 1930s southern juke bar. The cinematography and score are also excellent. The mid credits scene was a great epilogue and secret ending to the film that felt like a great story bonus that just makes you wonder what happened in that huge time gap."

The world felt completely real, from the clothes they wore to the way they spoke. It honestly felt like you were dropped right into that time and place.The music fit perfectly, and the cinematography was stunning. They did something really cool with the aspect ratios too, which gave certain scenes more weight. The sound was loud and powerful, just how you want it in IMAX. To grab this amount of raw authenticity it could only be shot on film. It has a gritty film grain, and I loved every minute of it.The acting was excellent across the board. Michael B. Jordan absolutely delivered in a role that asked a lot from him. There wasn't a single weak performance. This movie feels big and important. It's the best film I've seen in 2025 so far. If you can, go see it in IMAX while you still have the chance. If you go and see it more than once then IMAX must be one of those because its impact on this film is stunning.I think Ryan Coogler is the real deal. Sinners is Cinema!Carl.HD MOVIE SOURCE/"

The music score added a nice touch to the movie and narrative along with the sinful dance moves. Sinners is one of those movies that will have you returning for a second viewing. You will be interested in the Indians chase of the vampire and their history with bloodsuckers. Michael B Jordan is such a superb actor. He portrays two characters and they are totally different. This movie will take you on a thrilling adventure into the lustful world of new baby vampires! There were heroes in this movie and of course death! Sinners is the best movie I've seen this year! The experience of watching high quality filmmaking is a plus for me. There are some surprises at the end so don't rush to leave at the end. Kudos to everyone involved in this masterpiece! Word of mouth will definitely carry this movie! In short, this movie is excellent and should be watched twice! Bravo to the entire cast and crew!"

          "content": "I have to start with that I am frankly biased. I will always be someone who defends the Blank Panther and Creed movies as masterpieces. I am even willing to say they are perfect movies. So with that out of the way. I WILL FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL FOR THIS MOVIE IF ANYONE SAYS THAT THIS MASTERPIECE, BIG 5 OSCAR WORTHY PIECE OF GOLD ISN'T 110/10!! This movie perfectly blends horror, comedy, soul, and most of all music into a beautiful mix of Mississippi goodness. Obviously, Hailee Steinfield and Michael B Jordan once again deliver incredible performances as their respective characters (Might I add that B Jordan is playing 2 different roles) but the most stand out performance comes from the young Miles Caton. In his debut film, he quickly gives you a plate of award worthy acting in the first hour and then when you ask for seconds he says, \"Sorry ran out of that, but here have this instead\" AND GIVES YOU A PERFORMANCE EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! Coogler also has long time collaborator Ludwig Göransson compose the music for this movie and just like with the Black Panther movies, he scores music that brings you into the world. It flesh's out characters and the environment at the same time. If you don't believe me go listen to \"I Lied To You\" on the soundtrack, it's honestly a perfect composition. Of there's one thing Coogler is good at, is weaving symbolism that is heavy handed to say the least, but never feels to preachy or force fed. All the messages and symbolism about Racism against black people in 1930's (and even some for today) are spoon fed to you so that way the message doesn't become a chore to learn and instead helps you understand what fears the characters deal with everyday. The most effective way this is shown is in a scene where 3 men drive through a Cotton Field and see some black prisoners working. After that, one of the men starts telling a story about how his friend unfortunately was murdered by the Klan. The entire sequence a piece of art and you can see the pain in actor Delroy Lindo's eyes as he recounts it. All in all, this movie is perfect and it already has cemented itself as a Classic Vampire flick in the same way I'd say \"The Lost Boys\" did when it came out.TLDR:GO SEE THIS MOVIE."

          "content": "The makers of this film have said that they were influenced by Dusk til Dawn - a film that morphs from thriller to supernatural halfway through.Twin brothers, known as Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B Jordan) return to their home in the American South in 1932, having made some decent money in Chicago, courtesy of Al Capone. Their plan is to set up a \"Juke Joint\" (which was what nightclubs were called, back then, apparently). Most of the action takes place during the course of one day, in which they make arrangements for opening night, including recruiting musicians - a young guitarist Sam (Miles Caton) and a grizzled and alcoholic pianist Slim (Delroy Lindo, who steals the scene every time he's on camera). This opening section, though not without its moments, felt unnecessarily slow - and there were times that I wished that subtitles had been provided for the non-Americans in the audience.So far so good. Opening night proves a roaring success. In particular, Sam's guitar is revealed to be a magical instrument, leading to a memorably surreal sequence. Then a bunch of vampires show up. The rest of the film is viscerally bloody.To be honest, this sudden switch struck me as jarring, and left a few loose ends flapping. In particular, I wanted to know more about the native Americans who were introduced in one scene, chasing the chief vampire, but were never seen again.Still, the music was good, and the action pleasantly gruesome.There was a scene after the vampires had been dealt with in which some racists got rather more than they deserved - something which didn't really have any place in the narrative; but the film redeemed itself in a post-credits scene set sixty years later, when the now old and grizzled Sam receives an unexpected visit and achieves some sort of closure.A decent enough film, but not a masterpiece."

The story is great, but vampire movies aren't my thing, that's the only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 score. The opening scene is a key element. That made it impossible to be bored at any point in the film. Then there's a scene around the middle which is something that will probably be studied in film schools. The dialogues are just perfectly natural and every character has their own language.The cinematography is gorgeous, the scenery especially in the first half is breathtaking. Their are a few one takes, which are just too good. I've mentioned my favourite scene in the middle of the film. I could say it's one of those one takes, but I'd rather say it's the goat. The directing and the editing are equally perfect. The parallels are amazing. The score and soundtrack is Oscar-worthy. The acting performances are outstanding, especially Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo, who played my favourite character.Sinners is very likely to win a few Academy Awards next year and I'd be very happy if it does so."

They are seasoned WWI veterans fresh from a stint in Chicago where they have returned to the deep south to open their own Juke Joint, paid in full with cash. The first 30 min or so of the film is their gathering the food, booze and music talent they need to make for an epic night!!! One of the great finds is the old piano harmonic player Delray Lindo! A powerhouse!!!!!! All of the cast is superb. The Mojo Queen warns that if they make too much good music, they can open the doors to the other side, the past and the future.

I loved the central theme surrounding music and how it has no bounds. The scene when all the music came together in time was frankly PHENOMENAL.I loved the cast from the leads to the supporting cast. What a thoughtful execution of characters.There were some \"jump moments\" in the film and lots of surprise screams in my theater 😜. The music was amazing and I was very entertained by the multiple plot lines offered.Sidebar: it was wild to hear the Asian-American characters speak in Southern dialect.

Problem is, the boy is a prodigy musician who lives for the music...so off he goes. The local bad boys are twins (played by Michael B Jordan and you CANNOT tell he has been SFX'd into the same scenes) that are veterans and who have just come back home from Chicago after robbing some gangsters, now they are going to open a speakeasy where the music will be played and big time parties will happen.The first hour and a half of this movie is basically the historical story of the brothers and the musician kid as they round up a group of locals who run the club. During these scenes, the musician kid is drawn closer to the late night world and all the colorful characters who inhabit it, and the audience come to really care about these characters.But at the club, once the boy starts to play his music...he is so good he channels an energy that goes beyond himself and reaches deeper into the mysteries of time and the universe, and suddenly some of the darker elements of the club scene begin to manifest. There are fights, theft, women being unfaithful...and of course the club is attacked by Vampires. These monsters (the embodiment of sin) have come for his music, his life, and his soul.What follows is a bloody good time as all the characters who have come to know are pitted against these Vampires, and the musician is forced to chose between the music or the path his father wants for him.All in all, this was an excellent Vampire movie, a good historical film, and a coming of age story about a young musician who has to be scarred in order to grow into a man he is destined to become. A powerful gothic tale of horror, and an excellent film."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners arrives with a potent blend of historical drama and vampire horror, boasting the raw ingredients to join the ranks of the genre's elite. Set against the simmering racial tensions of the 1930s Mississippi Delta, the film crafts a compelling narrative about family, community, and the seductive allure of darkness. While a significant visual misstep holds it back from true perfection, the film's strengths are undeniable and warrants me going to see it again.The slow burn of Sinners' first two acts is masterful. Coogler meticulously lays the groundwork, introducing us to the complex relationships between World War I veteran twins Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) as they establish a juke joint for the local Black community. Their earnest efforts to create a safe haven are beautifully interwoven with the personal struggles of their circle: the burgeoning musical talent of their young cousin Sammie (a revelation played with captivating vulnerability by Miles Caton, who genuinely shines and even lends his own impressive vocals to the soundtrack).The film's visual presentation is a significant drawback. The overwhelmingly dark cinematography, while perhaps intended to create a sense of foreboding, often obscures crucial details and makes it difficult to fully engage with the on-screen action. During several key sequences, particularly those set at night or indoors, the lack of discernible light borders on frustrating. If the print I viewed was indeed representative of the final cut, this is a serious misstep that actively detracts from the film's overall impact. I sincerely hope this was an anomaly, as the narrative and performances deserve to be seen with greater clarity.The film's other minor stumble lies in its pacing towards the climax. The deliberate build-up, while initially a strength, unfortunately leaves the antagonist, the Irish vampire Remmick (played with chilling charisma), with less screen time in the final act than desired. Just as Remmick's motivations and the full extent of his malevolence begin to truly unfold, the film rushes towards its conclusion. A more extended confrontation with this intriguing villain would have undoubtedly elevated the ending.Despite these flaws, the performances across the board are exceptional. Michael B. Jordan brings a quiet intensity to Smoke, portraying a man haunted by the past yet fiercely protective of his community. Jack O'Connell delivers a nuanced performance as the conflicted Stack, torn between his past and present. Hailee Steinfeld imbues Mary with a palpable sense of longing and resentment. But it is Miles Caton as Sammy who truly steals the show. His portrayal of the young, musically gifted cousin is both endearing and powerful, and his musical performances are a genuine highlight, adding an authentic layer of soul to the film.Sinners possesses a unique and compelling premise, expertly blending historical context with vampire lore. The slow-burn narrative effectively builds tension and invests the audience in its characters. The performances, particularly Miles Caton's breakout role, are outstanding. While the oppressively dark cinematography and a slightly rushed final act prevent it from achieving its full potential as a top-tier vampire film, the strengths of Sinners are undeniable. It's a film brimming with atmosphere and compelling storytelling that warrants a viewing - and in my case, hopefully a second viewing under better visual conditions - to fully appreciate its dark and captivating world."

Michael B did an awesome job portraying two different characters. This was a thriller sprinkled with comic relief sprinkled with drama, action, romance, sci-fi, musical and horror. A perfect mix of all the above. The soundtrack is even awesome. So much, I could go on and on. Overall, even better than what I anticipated and highly recommend."

Thematically, the movie made up for the lack of vampire elements.Sinners is packed with Black culture, history, and pride, and told through the lens of horror and thriller. Love it!I tapped my feet, nodded my head, and smiled with the heartbeat of the film.Yes Ryan, I will watch this again and again!"

Coogler hinted that vampires wouldn't be \"the only supernatural element\" the film deals with. Another big theme of the story is blues music and how it can transcend realms and call larger forces into action. The twins also represent one of the archetypes Coogler wanted to explore in the movie. There is a lot of blood in this movie."

          "content": "Sinners is a cathartic film that once again showcases Ryan Coogler's prowess and his all-around understanding of cinema. It's definitely one of those vampire movies that feels refreshing-clearly influenced by other works, yes-but far less derivative than you might expect going in. The film's purpose is to build understanding and highlight the backdrop of Black culture, the love of music, and the idea that we all breathe art and crave freedom.The cast does its job, led by the star power of Michael B. Jordan-his masculinity and charisma are what consistently make him to get over the crowd similar to WWE stars. Jack O'Connell plays the villain really well; he's honestly been one of the most underrated greats of the past 15 years. And Delroy Lindo clearly enjoyed himself, which is always fun to watch and easy to admire.The whole setup before the film shifts into full-on bang bang mode with blood splattering everywhere feels longer than it needed to be. The exposition is pretty heavy, with parts that honestly could've been trimmed. Some of the characters also weren't established as effectively as I would've liked. But Sinners truly shines when it comes to cinematography, set design, and its masterful use of aspect ratios and sound design. It pulls out the whole playbook, and in that regard, it's going to be tough for any film this year to top it."

          "content": "** spoilers are included in this reviewRyan Coogler's Sinners is a visually stunning and emotionally profound exploration of duality, legacy, and Black identity in the American South. At its surface, it's a period vampire thriller. But beneath the blood and horror lies a richly layered narrative that palpitates with history, music, spirituality, and rebellion.Michael B. Jordan delivers an electrifying dual performance as twin brothers Smoke and Stack-characters who are polar opposites yet forever intertwined. Smoke is disciplined, serious, and grounded; Stack is charming, impulsive, and carefree. Their opposing natures are more than just character choices-they represent deeper conflicts between duty and desire, tradition and evolution, the sacred and the secular.These themes of duality ripple through every corner of the film. The contrast between the Black church and the juke joint, between the spiritual and the carnal, is presented not as a dichotomy, but as a coexisting reality within Black life. One of the film's most poignant moments is a church sermon about becoming \"fishers of men\"-a call to salvation that eerily echoes in a later scene where vampires seek to convert souls for their own dark purposes. This mirroring adds a powerful spiritual weight to the film's horror elements.Set in 1932 Mississippi, Sinners is as much about the real-life horror of Jim Crow America as it is about the supernatural. A chilling scene features Delta Slim-played masterfully by Delroy Lindo-passing a chain gang of Black prisoners watched over by a white overseer on horseback. Slim pays respect to the men, offering them dignity and encouragement, a simple gesture that unsettles the white guard and foreshadows deeper tensions. Lindo's portrayal of Slim is grounded, tender, and fiercely intelligent. His monologue about an old friend who tried to escape the South, only to be castrated and lynched by the KKK, is one of the film's most heart-wrenching moments-a moment that sent shivers down my spine.Newcomer Miles Caton is unforgettable as Sammie \"Preacher Boy\" Moore, the son of a pastor who is torn between his religious upbringing and his calling to the blues. Sammie's voice-deep, raw, and soulful-feels like it was pulled directly from the Delta soil. His journey mirrors the crossroads that many Black artists have faced: to follow the path laid by tradition, or to risk damnation (literal and figurative) by forging a new one. That this is Caton's first film is astonishing-his performance is soulful, deeply felt, and unforgettable.Hailee Steinfeld plays Mary, a woman in the deep south navigating the complexities of passing for white while harboring an unresolved love for Stack. Her internal conflict and fragile longing add another layer to the film's exploration of identity and hidden histories. In contrast, Wunmi Mosaku's Annie is rooted, knowing, and spiritually anchored. A woman who has lost a child with her true love, Smoke, Annie channels her African spirituality to guide and protect him. Her presence in the film is quietly powerful-she's not just a love interest, but an intercessor, a mystic, and a keeper of ancestral knowledge.Mary and Annie are yet another reflection of the film's central theme of duality-women who love two sides of the same man, each representing different worlds: assimilation versus authenticity, lost lineage versus spiritual rootedness.Every performance in Sinners is stellar, and each character feels like they've lived many lives before appearing on screen. The cinematography-shot on 65mm film with IMAX sequences-adds to the film's immersive quality, pulling viewers into its textured, haunted world. Ludwig Göransson's score, blending Delta blues with horror motifs, ties the whole experience together in a way that's both visceral and transcendent.Sinners is not just a film-it's an experience. It's a story about transformation: literal, cultural, and spiritual. It demands to be seen more than once, not just for its breathtaking artistry but for the deep questions it raises about who we are, what we inherit, and what it means to fight for your soul in a world that keeps trying to claim it."

          "content": "9/10. Sinners comes in a southern baked blend of fantastic filmmaking, part gangster drama, a celebration of the blues, deep fried action, Michael B. Jordan in a dual role, and vampire horror.(I might give this a 10/10. I give those to very few films and need to soak this cinematic experience in. Might stay at 9/10.)Finally! We have a contender for one of the best movies of 2025. Exhilarating and a solid ride. I really enjoyed this film.Ryan Coogler deftly blends genres packaged together in this horror flick. Organically, Coogler gives the musical past of the blues a huge shoutout and weaves it into a vampire horror set in the backdrop of a gritty, 1930's Mississippi. Racism and family are big themes underlined with dark humor and religion. The story is a pair of twins come back to their hometown to set up a new life and leave the past behind. But supernatural activity will throw those plans into chaos.Coogler finally has room to breath to direct his artistic, visual filmmaking. No constraints and no MCU baggage. He gives us an original film with his confident, patient, and visually spectacular directing. He patiently builds up the film. At first it seems like a gritty, dirty, period piece with gangsters, racism, and money. Then he intertwines blues music. Then veers into the more creepy, scary vibe. Then goes into the vampire territory intertwined with more blues music, violence, and blood. Yes, this is also his love letter to blues music. It is important because the hip hop, rock, and heavy metal landscape would have looked vastly different without the blues. He balances everything out while some of the characters are dealing with the racism of the south.Coogler utilizes IMAX film and Ultra Panavision 70mm film to capture everything. Even Christopher Nolan helped him with the process. I love that great filmmakers such as Ryan Coogler, Christopher Nolan, Jordan Peele, Quentin Tarantino, and Paul Thomas Anderson use old school film stock to create memorable films. Proves that physical film and media isn't dead.(I'm still mad at Best Buy for them stop carrying physical movies and Target at their stores. But that is just me.)Michael B. Jordan help carry the film with his dual role. He plays the twins very distinctly and a phenomenal job at differentiating the two. If you don't know who he is, then you would have thought he was actual twins. He really should be nominated an Oscar for this. He brings charm and old school wit to the screen. He brings the sledgehammer and fighting to vampires and evil.The beautiful Hailee Steinfield (Hawkeye, True Grit) fits in very well with the rest of the cast. I'm ignoring the fact of my Kansas City Chiefs being rivals with the Buffalo Bills. She did a wonderful job. But who is Miles Caton? He did an excellent job in his acting debut. Young dude has bright future in acting and music. The rest of the cast is solid and they do a great job.The music through the IMAX sound system is breathtaking. Again, Ludwig was awesome with the soundtrack. I loved that heavy metal is included in some of the movie. But hearing the blues blaring loud and awesome with the unique camera angles needs to be heard on the big screen. Arkapaw's cinematography is beautiful, dirty, and terrifying.Go see this on the biggest screen possible. Sure, the third act goes into cliché territory some and part of the logic at the end is questionable. But we have a solid, original film not relying on soulless, corporate IP stuff. This film has soul, heart, and blood splatter.Yes, stay throughout the entire credits.Let's take a small look at what my CMRU (Cinematic Movie Reviewing Universe) thought:\n-Me: \"Let's keep this short, respectful, and simple for our 16th review.\"\n-Mrs. Munchie: \"Woohoo! Everything about this film slayed. Yes, one of my favorites! 10/10.\"\n-Cool Bob (Munchie, Earth 2): \"Ryan Coogler and Ludwig Göransson music go together like peanut butter and jelly. 10/10.\"\n-Mr. Oner (with a drink in his hand): \"Yeah, that blues music had me dancing and toe tapping all over! 9/10.\"\n-A Stan: \"This film actually made me happy for once. Just so epic. 9/10.\"\n-Mrs. Lint: \"I was not expecting this from a Twilight prequel. 9/10.\"\n-Me: \"Uh, almost got through this normally. Ok, that will wrap it up.\"The End."

Could have been an original demon/evil/voodoo film to represent black heritage but instead the message was white people are evil, white women cant resist black men and vampires hate sunlight/wooden stakes/silver and live forever which is typical and boring. As soon as the evil people were unveiled to be plain old vampires, Sinners lost its momentum and never picked it back up. 6.5/10."

The monsters are technically very well executed with great special effects, however their storyline is bland and unoriginal. Despite all the metaphors and efforts to connect the genres, due to the difference in the quality of the 2 stories, it still feels like you watched a great historical movie with a B rated horror shortfilm at the end. 7/10."

You have a fun set of characters protrayed by a phenomenal cast of actors. Everyone in the cast is having the time of their lives especially Michael B. Jordan and Hailee Steinfeld. Aside from that, this is just an expertly directed movie from start to finish. The cinematography looks gorgeous and there are a lot of amazing shots in the movie. The use of music is also phenomenal and it plays a major part in the movie. There are buckets of blood that will satisfy gore hounds like me. I also loved that Ryan Coogler used practical effects for the gore in the movie and that makes me more happy as a horror fan. There is also social commentary on culture and racism that is done very well and in a way that feels natural and organic. The musical score from Ludwig Goransson is perfect with everything happening on screen. And finally, the ending to this movie is absolutely perfect in every way possible.Overall, Sinners (2025) is an insanely phenomenal ride that proves to Hollywood that you can make a great original movie with a big budget and a great cast. The is by far my favorite movie of 2025 and we still have a stacked list for the rest of the year."

The characters are distinctive and memorable, the performances are top-notch, and the world-building is rich and atmospheric. It's a western, a drama, and a musical all at once, and somehow it works. For a while.Then comes the second half.This is where things fall apart. The pivot to horror-specifically vampires-feels abrupt and half-hearted. There's barely a story holding it together, and the horror/action sequences barely last 10-15 minutes. They lack any real suspense or memorable set pieces. The execution feels rushed and undercooked, especially after such a powerful setup.The final 5-7 minutes attempt a bold anti-Klan message, and it's likely this moment of violence and symbolism that won over many critics. But for me, it was too little, too late.What's most frustrating is the wasted potential. This could've been a truly unique vampire film-rooted in history, rich in theme, driven by character and song. Instead, it leaves you wondering what could've been if the second half had lived up to the promise of the first."

The direction, storytelling, performances (give Michael B. Jordan that Oscar), cinematography, and music are all top-tier. Ryan Coogler has officially cemented his place in the horror/vampire genre with something original and unforgettable.This film is going to be studied in film classes for years-especially that dance sequence. It's visually stunning, haunting, symbolic, and elevates the entire scene without a single line of dialogue."

          "content": "This, my ladies and lads, isn't the typical vampire actioner you think it'd turn out to be! And that's how Ryan Coogler sets the whole thing up from the get-go. There's the ingenuity with which Coogler develops his setting, characters, and plot. Miles Caton's Sammie is who we see first, followed by the twins - Smoke & Stack - played by Michael B Jordan. We also get to know a bunch of other characters as the first act moves along, with a steady sprinklage of wry (and often foreplay-related) humour. Even though we see the twins and the rest of these characters just over the course of a single day and night, we know there's history to them. That's established in an unhurried, classy way.There's also commentary around \"blues\" being the devil's music, while we get to see how talented Sammie is. Now, the music is where the film shines well and truly. Ludwig Göransson's score is a undoubtedly a masterpiece, guiding you through the film's pivotal and emotional scenes. Learning how Serena Göransson produced the songs for the film makes me admire the effort all the more. The next big applause goes to editor Michael P. Shawver whose abrupt cutaways during \"typical\" jumpscare scenes ADD SO MUCH to the theatrical experience. There are a few jumpscares too, but even they're smartly staged and placed.Also, how can I not mention the stunning cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw (especially, those sunset and sunrise shots.. GODDAMN), and the way she captures the yellow-lit insides of the stunningly aesthetic juke joint. There's a scene where Sammie's music invokes spirits from various timelines; it's just a piece of marvel. I think Miles Caton did a fantastic job in his debut role, playing Sammie with just the right amount of vulnerability and musical flair. Michael B Jordan is a knockout once again, excelling in dual roles.Hailee Steinfeld makes for a sexy-as-hell vamp, playing her role to the T. The rest of the cast (Jack O'Connell as Remmick, Wunmi Mosaku as Annie, Jayme Lawson as Pearline, Omar Benson Miller as Cornbread, Delroy Lindo as Delta Slim, and Li Jun Li as Grace Chow) is spectacular in keeping the humour, element of surprise, and emotional bits going. On the whole, Sinners is a definite winner in my books, and I'm stoked about the recognition it's getting worldwide."

          "content": "Taking place in 1932 Mississippi, Sinners is about twin brothers Smoke and Stack returning to their hometown leaving their troubled pasts to start over. They purchase a saw mill from a racist landowner wanting to turn it into a juke joint for the black community. The brothers recruit their cousin Sammie who is an aspiring guitarist and the trio bring in several performers and helpers to create a fun time for the community. However, the good times do not last as there is a greater evil waiting for them...Aside from maybe The Day the Earth Blew Up, Sinners was probably my most anticipated movie of the year. A vampire movie made from scratch directed by Ryan Coogler with Michael B. Jordan as the star? Hell yes. Even further is how cool the trailers looked without giving away any of the movie's plot points. Add on the fact that this is one of the best reviewed movies by both critics and audiences in years and I felt the hype. I try not to hype myself up for movies too much because that could lead to disappointment... this movie did not.Sinners is a movie that has everything in it. Ryan Coogler prepares a southern gothic horror movie epic filled with vampire action, drama, musical sequences, themes on racism in the 1930s, fantasy elements and even some really solid comedy. While the shuffling of genres can be a tiny bit messy, it still works because as a movie, Sinners is one of the most entertaining experiences I have had at a movie theater in years. It is a movie that gets better with each passing scene.From the minute that the twins and Sammie start recruiting people for the juke joint, I was so engaged in the characters and performances. Seriously, this movie will grab peoples attention just with the conversations of the characters because they are charismatic and precise. Furthermore, the gets more interesting with each act with the vampires coming into play in one of the most creative ways possible. The great first two acts lead to one of the most unforgettable final acts I have ever seen in a movie in theaters. I felt the tension in my bones right before the climax happened. Not many movies do that but Sinners brought some serious emotions out of me.One thing I love about this movie is how freaking original it is with its take on vampires. They have a gimmick to them that makes them more interesting and then there is a sequence with them before they attack that blew socks off. Before that, there is this wonderful musical sequence connecting past and present which is something I did not expect in a movie like this. I had no idea what to expect from this movie, but it blew my expectations on some of the crazy things that happen. This movie takes vampires and Blues music to create something truly extraordinary and fresh and we rarely ever see a big budget movie with so much originality.Also, I really like this movie's sense of humor. This movie has made me laugh and the audience I was with laugh more than comedy films I have seen this year. The comedic dialogue is perfectly timed to take a little tension off from an intense scene. It even has a poop joke that made me laugh and that never happens with me. It does take away the dark tone of the film that focuses on the discrimination of black people of this time era and the potential pain of immortality. In fact, the longer the characters are in the juke joint, the darker the film gets and the more nerving the tension gets.The performances are phenomenal in this movie. This movie has some of the best acting I have seen in a while. Michael B. Jordan blew me away with his dual performance as Smoke and Stack. He is so charming and intimidating in these roles and one actor creates two completely different characters effortlessly. His role as Smoke is one of my favorite characters and performances I have seen in a while as his character arc is mesmerizing from start to finish. Also, whatever special effects they had to have to Michael B. Jordan's on the screen are great too because he looks great when both of his characters are on screen together. Michael B. Jordan shows with his performances here that he is one of the best actors working today.Another standout is Miles Caton as Sammie. This is Caton's first role in a film this guy knocks it out of the park. First of all, Caton has one hell of a voice and his singing is sensational. Some of the most memorable moments in the movie come from his singing. However, his emotions and line delivery show how much his character changes throughout the film. Sammie in general serves as the heart of the film as he is one of nicest and most likable characters in the film. For a film debut, Miles Caton killed it and I hope to see more from him in the future.The supporting cast is excellent too. We have Delroy Lindo as one of the most likable comic relief characters I have seen in a while with Delta Slim. This is a guy that can crack a lot of jokes quickly, but knows when to get serious and protective of the people in the juke joint when the scene calls for it. Li Jun Li is fantastic as Grace Chow and she has one of the best moments in the film right before the climax. She goes from zero to a hundred in that scene and it is glorious to watch. Wunmi Mosaku is memorable as Annie who is knowledgeable about vampires. Mosaku has some great acting with her eyes and body language throughout the film. Hailee Steinfield gives one of her best performances as Mary with both huge presence and some level of scariness in the second half of the film. Jayme Lawson is absolutely gorgeous as Pearline while playing a very likable and sympathetic character with great chemistry with Caton. This cast is great not just in the acting department, but singing wise too. A lot of the actors here take part in the musical moments and songs in here and they all knock their parts out of the park.The main villain is pretty unforgettable. Remmick is the perfect mixture of politeness and terror that a vampire has, but his charm and his own singing abilities make him that much more memorable and threatening because of his mix of mind games and killer instincts. Also, Jack O'Connell delivers a perfect performance as this vampire capturing his undeniably charming presence and wicked vampire instincts. In fact, his accent is spot on to the point that it surprised me to hear his real accent in one of his interviews after the movie!Visually, the movie looks stunning. The cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw is dripping with the gothic southern atmosphere and it has two amazing one-takes. The first being a take with the Chows going through town and the second is that stunning musical sequence going back and forward in time. The way the film is shot is another way how this movie keeps you mesmerized. I love the editing too. It keeps the story going at a fluid place while showing off some creative techniques to have two scenes happening at the same time or to cut to another scene right before something crazy goes down. The costumes fit the movie perfectly and the makeup on the vampires is believable. Ryan Coogler really captured the time period and the gothic tone of the film perfectly with the visuals and the atmosphere. The movie gets more and more intense the further the story continues and the build up to the climax is some of the best build up I have seen in a movie.One of my favorite aspects about this movie though: The freaking soundtrack! This movie has one of the single greatest soundtracks I have ever heard in any film. The score by Ludwig Göransson is simply magical from the moment the movie start to the minute it ends. The songs in here are absolutely sensational. I went into this movie knowing as little about it as I could, but I did not expect this movie to have such an emphasis on music. Each song was unique and memorable telling a lot about the characters and the story while being insanely entertaining to listen to. My favorites are \"I Lied to You,\" \"In Moonlight,\" \"Pale, Pale Moon,\" and \"Rocky Road to Dublin.\" The \"Rocky Road to Dublin\" sequence in particular makes for another moment on why I love going to the movies.In a world where a lot of big budget films are remakes, sequels or based on existing properties, Sinners is the exact kind of film I wish we got more often. It is original, it is entertaining, it is intense and it has a lot of great satire and commentary on issues important to this day. Ryan Coogler created a stunning movie that any viewer could find enjoyment in whether it would be the musical scenes, the performances, the vampires or the gripping story. I really hope this is the movie that breaks the mold of big budget original movies not doing well at the box office because it deserves every bit of praise it got. Go see this movie as soon as possible.This movie is so good, I want to watch it in theaters again! Normally, I only watch a movie in theaters once when they are released. I might make an exception here..."

They served in WW1 and were gunmen for Al Capone. They round up some locals to help them in their enterprise, young guitarist Sammie (Miles Caton), his preacher father says the Blues is the devil's music, veteran blues harmonica and piano player Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) and singer Pearline (Jayme Lawson). Smoke's ex-wife Annie (Wunmi Mosaku) is into the occult, gave him a hoodoo fetish to keep him safe, she agrees to cook at the juke joint. Stack meets up with an angry old flame Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), she's white but one eighth black. They also have the help of local Chinese shopkeepers, Grace (Li Jun Li) and Bo (Yao) who straddle the racial divide, they have two stores in town, one on the white side of the street, the other on the black. This is also a social history of the Jim Crow era, black people work on plantations, and are often partially paid with coins that can only be redeemed at certain stores. The Klan is still about. Some great blues music is played at the juke joint at one stage it appears to create timeslips, with musicians from the future and the past appearing. Then some white folks appear (we know they are vampires) they play tunes but are turned away (they have to be invited in). They turn those who venture out while playing a great version of Will Ye Go, Lassie Go? But their Rocky Road To Dublin exceeds everything else, vampires singing and performing Irish Set Dances lead by Irish Vampire Remmick (Jack O'Connell). The Juke Joint is under siege. Vampire lore is presented, they jump, fly, burn to varying degrees in sunlight, hate garlic, silver bullets and wooden stakes may be effective. The tension is well maintained with some curveballs thrown as Remmick invites them all to join him in a multi-racial Vampire army. Truly impressive scenes of horror as vampires bite, feed and turn their victims. The revenants are shot down, riddled with bullets only to rise again. Choctaw vampire hunters are involved earlier in the film. Outstanding performances from an ensemble cast. There is a mid-credits and a post credits scene so don't hurry out of the cinema. Imho this will become a classic Vampire film. Written, Directed, and Produced by Ryan Coogler. 9.5/10."

          "content": "Set in 1932 twin brothers Elijah \"Smoke\" Moore and Elias \"Stack\" Moore (both played by Michael B. Jordon) return to their hometown of Clarksville, Mississippi having acquired a large amount of funds from their time working for the syndicates in Chicago intent on opening a \"Juke Joint\" at an abandoned sawmill. With their musically inclined cousin Sammie \"Preacher Boy\" Moore (Miles Canton) set to play at their club despite his father, Reverend Jedidiah Moore (Saul Williams) disapproval, the three acquire additional talent, help, and resources for their big opening night rekindling both old friendships and old romances in the process. However, while the big opening night seems like a prelude to success, a shadow descends upon the occasion turning a night of care free celebration into a fight for survival against relentless evil.Sinners is the latest film from writer director Ryan Coogler who parlayed his critical success in the indie hit Furitvale Station to blockbuster success with the likes of Creed and the two Black Panther films. Development began on the then untitled film in 2024 when a bidding war erupted between Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros. For the film with Warner Bros. Eventually winning out. Coogler stated that his desire with the film was to create something personal as the impetus for the film came from his experiences growing up in Richmond, California where he'd walk over to his uncle's house who had a substantial collection of Blues records and would tell Ryan stories of how his time in Mississippi post-WW2 and the racial tensions that forced him to flee westward and serving as the foundation for what would eventually become Sinners. With a handsomely mounted production, a rich atmospheric soundtrack, and an engaging ensemble across the board Sinners makes for an entertaining good time that can be enjoyed on a genre level while also possessing a great deal of love and admiration for Blues music and the black contributions to the American arts that transcend decades and genres.In terms of describing what Sinners is in the broadest terms, the best approximation I can think of is imagine if you took the period visuals, soundtrack incorporation, and quirky characterization of O Brother, Where Art Thou? And mixed it with the genre intensity and gear switching of From Dusk 'til Dawn and mix it with the musical energy of The Last Dragon (albeit minus the camp) and you might get something similar to Sinners. While the movie starts out already engaging with a heavy Southern Gothic atmosphere that creates an engaging world of Clarksville, Mississippi that exists in the shadow of Jim Crow, it fills that atmosphere with all manner of engaging characters ranging from Michael B. Jordan's engaging dual role as twins Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore who run the gamut of allowing Jordan to play with suave swagger and colder more ruthless intensity in equal measure while also allowing for strong humanity in the respective romantic subplots with Hailee Steinfeld's Mary and Wunmi Mosaku's Annie both creating memorable multi-dimensioned love interests and characters in their own rights who could've made an engaging story on their own. Miles Caton is also very good as Smoke and Stack's musically inclined though innocent cousin who adds a good counterpoint to the rest of the more cynical characters with his dreams of playing blues at odds with his religious upbringing. A collection of characters this rich makes the first half of this film already an engaging sit (and I've barely talke about all of them such as Delroy Lindo's role as an alcoholic harmonica player that feels Best Supporting Actor worthy) and once it switches genres by the halfway point into a siege film you really feel invested in these characters.But beyond the very engaging characters and story, Coogler also adds another layer as the soundtrack and music acts almost as a co-lead. Beneath the gritty crime drama and genre survival spectacle, Coogler creates a film that visually tells the story of not only Blues music but the black contribution to music both past and future with a standout sequence where Preacher Boy's blues balads intermix with African tribal chants, 60s and 70s rock, and even 80s to contemporary rap and hip-hop in an ambitious gamble of a sequence that could've gone wrong (such seen with similar experiments in Alex Cox's failed 1987 film Walker) but pays off as a strong usage of magic realism that emphasizes how much love and respect Coogler has for this music and it's one of only a handful of details which include not only the location of Clarksville, Mississippi (a town notable for its blues heritage including connections to Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson) and cameos by various black musical figures. In a way I was reminded a little of 2021's The Harder They Fall which tried to do this mixture of genre entertainment with musical energy, but unlike that film which had plenty of style, Sinners not only has the style but also the substance to put it to effective use.I really enjoyed Sinners and not only is it one of my favorite films I've seen this year so far, but I can't wait to revisit it as I imagine there's plenty of details that I missed that I'll want to catch on a second go around."

This movie is groundbreaking in how visually the story was told.The music, the scores throughout the film were beautiful and brilliant. They brought each scene to life, bringing the emotion to the characters in that moment.The casting of each character was phenomenal, you can see and feel the joy and sorrow so clearly. Of course, I mainly watched it because Michael B. Jordan was in the film and it is a Ryan Coolger film. But the care and detail that they did in picking the cast to bring this film to life was amazing."

There's no point in the movie where you feel like doing something else it's keeps you stuck and engaged to the very end. It's respects the vampire genre as it sticks to the rules but plays with it too.Great performances from the actors and Ryan Coogler the director. It is so far my favorite movie of the year and that will take some beating as Sinners is a 10/10 movie."

          "content": "This movie has no direction, and I struggle to see the substance that the media and other reviewers claim. This movie was advertised as a horror film, but it's really not. This movie has love interests, but they all appear out of nowhere and are therefore kind of meaningless. The message behind this movie is definitely heavy and interesting. But just like Barbie, sometimes they take things a bit too far. A lot of scenes seem pointless, even entire characters seem pointless or they have been created for one single purpose. The biggest example of this is Cornbread. Don't let this movie outshine Warfare.As a horror film, there is no atmosphere and doesn't really have much to offer as a horror movie outside of a few cheap jump scares here and there. I can see why this movie has appeal, some of the shots are nice, the soundtrack is great but in my opinion is consistently over relied on. There are some good action scenes, but nothing is worth the wait.Sinners by Ryan Coogler, feels like a road-trip without a destination. There some neat sights, the tunes are cool, but after a while I found my self asking where the hell this is headed and not in a good way.Additionally, I feel like there have been other projects that are similar that have been executed much better. \"Get out\" and \"us\" by Jordan Peel stick out for me as offering similar messages but with much more purpose, direction, emotion and a significantly more potent atmosphere."

          "content": "POSITIVES:1) The performances are excellent. Michael B Jordan rightly gets most of the attention with the dual performances that he gives, but the supporting cast like Jack O'Connell, Hailee Steinfeld and Delroy Lindo were really great too.2) The direction from Ryan Coogler is so unbelievably slick and masterful. It really feels like watching a filmmaker that is incredibly assured in their ability that they make it look effortless. I had a blast watching this film.3) The score and the music sequences were awesome. Ludwig Goransson is arguably the composer most at the top of their game in the film business right now and you can really tell that from watching this film and listening to the music that he puts together for it.NEGATIVES:1) As the title of this review states, most the big swings that this film takes did work for me, but not all of them did. Firstly, the music sequence in the barn in which modern music starts playing, and we see a modern day DJ on the decks, didn't work for me at all and just took me out of the film. I don't think the theme around music having powers that transcend time was good enough to justify this frankly weird move from Coogler.2) Secondly, I hated the mid-credits scene that rounds off the film, where we see a modern day Sammy being revisited by the two surviving vampires. I could literally feel my score for the film being decreased from a 9 to an 8 in real time while I was watching this calamity of a sequence unfold on the screen. It was unbelievably self-indulgent from Coogler and there should've been a stern editor in the room telling him that this needed to go. It felt like the film completely jumping the shark, not least because the clothes Jordan and Steinfeld were wearing looked ridiculous, and I didn't buy this whole \"Smoke made me promise to leave you alone so I did\" excuse as to why they were only just popping up again now. The film should've stayed as an immersive period piece, because each time they tried to connect it to the modern day it just shattered the experience for me."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is the kind of blood and sweat soaked explosion of genres, themes, soul stirring music and elemental energies that we live for as movie fans, a one of a kind supersonic horror experience that shudders its percussive sound design to the marrow of bones and pushes the boundaries of cinematic storytelling to euphoric heights. In the 1930's Mississippi Delta, two voracious twin brothers (Michael B. Jordan in a dual tour de force) with connections to organized crime prepare to host grandest of openings for a planned juke joint, a sort of Blues themed speakeasy dance hall, which means hiring musicians both new (Miles Caton) and old (Delroy Lindo). Unfortunately these talents drew the attention of not just money spending Bayou partygoers but also some more sinister demonic beings led by the mercurial Remmick (Jack O'Connell, taking the term scene stealing to the next level), who have plans on crashing their party in utmost bloody fashion. This is a nutshell synopsis and at almost two and a half hours, Coogler has crafted a multifaceted horror period piece epic that covers a ton of tonal ground without ever feeling bloated or scattershot. I was of course reminded of Robert Rodriguez's classic From Dusk Till Dawn and indeed Coogler himself has said he took influence but also of the Coen Brothers' O Brother Where Art Thou in setting and desire to push traditional music to the forefront of the narrative without being an outright musical. Music here is a tool, a weapon, a communal healing wellspring and a mythic, totemic force of nature that connects people of various cultures to their ancestral roots with unspoken spirituality. There's a sequence I won't spoil here where song and instrument prove to be so powerful they transcend the boundaries of time and space in a way that is so beautifully unexpected it genuinely had my jaw on the floor, as did a brilliantly lively sequence where Remmick leads the vampires in a raucous, dance fuelled chorus of Rocky Road To Dublin. This film is the full package and then some, a hearty, dense, brazenly innovative vampire extravaganza packed to the fringes with authentic historic detail, well developed characters right down to the smaller roles, an eerie hovering score by Ludwig Göransson, a rich sense of time and place, some jump scares that practically reinvent the concept, magnificently crafted cinematography and enough heart pounding music to get the whole theatre up and stompin. A next level piece of cinema, the best films of the year so far and I really doubt anything will top it."

Truly blown away by the cast and the directing! The character of Sammi played by Miles Caton really brought life to the film with his voice.

I just have to ask though, why vampires? When you see the title, \"sinners\" you'd think devil/demon and evil spirits/paranormal activity, but it's vampires??? I get it's an evil spirit but was expecting a lot scarier. I'd honestly consider this movie to be more of a thriller than an actual horror movie. I just don't find vampire hunter movies to be scary. There were no jumpscares, not really much suspense that had me on the edge of my seat, or feeling somewhat scared. I actually laughed more than I felt scared. The villain had no backstory, no origin, just came out of nowhere. It would've been nice if they would've explained more of how he came to be. The father saying that music brings evil spirits just isn't enough. Like at least explain what can come and why it draws them to it. I get he said he was brought by the sound of music, but why? Why here? Did he come all the way from Ireland for this? So many holes in that part. Also not to mention, why at the end of the movie as soon as the sun hit all the vampires they all died practically instantly, yet when the villain first comes to show, he was running in the middle of wide open fields and roads with the sun on him and he's only burning up? Doesn't make much sense there. They spent more time in the movie being conflicted over inviting the vampires in rather than actually fighting them. Walking out of the movie, even going into the bathroom, the only conversations I was hearing were people claiming to be confused and ask why vampires. I understand it's a personal opinion, and to each their own, but vampires just aren't really scary. Made me think of a thriller take on twilight."

Ryan Coogler disappointed me on how simple and hollow this screenplay was written; it left me wondering what happened to the depth compared to Black Panther 2. What Hollywood is proving right now, is that marketing sells tickets now and not storytelling.

The blending if musical styles is very intriguing and could have been used even more.My main gripe of the film is Michael B. Jordan's superhero ending with the main vampire, amd the Rambo ending with the klan. The story was building into Preacher Boy Sammy getting the final kill against the 'devil' vampire and he should have stabbed him with the neck the guitar neck, which was what we saw it building too. Instead, MBJ comes from nowhere and takes the kill. The whole moment felt too hollywoody and ruined what could have been ana amazing ending for the character."

Add to that a gritty Southern Gothic atmosphere, haunting blues music woven into the story, and visuals that hit like a dream and a nightmare at once-you get something truly special.Every theme, every shot, every beat means something. Whether it's the emotional weight of Black resilience, the brutality of systemic violence, or the raw power of storytelling, Sinners delivers on all fronts.This is the kind of film you don't just watch-you feel it, and it stays with you.

Too much buildup and pacing was off. Little to no action due to building up the characters to do the ending.Unique movie.. felt some scenes dragged too long and unnecessarily. Enjoyable hopefully the next part had more action/thriller. I would have loved to see more into why his voice was special to the vampires.. get more insight to it.Also, less music..(2nd part) because now after watching this part we get the point into why music is important and all.

The film follows the twin brothers as they try to leave their troubled lives behind, returning to their hometown to start again, only to discover an even greater evil waiting to welcome them back.Michael B. Jordan plays the character \"Smoke\" with his twin brother \"Stack,\" played by Michael C. Jordan. Kidding aside, the twin is played by Michael B. Jordan alone. Yes, we are gifted to see two Michael B. Jordans on the big screen, both in their tank tops and with bloody muscles. Michael B. Jordan's performance was magnetic, which is odd because he has consistently delivered great performances every time he's on screen. Yet, he hasn't secured that one role that will earn him an Oscar nomination. As much as I would love for him to get an Oscar nod for this role, the Academy is notorious for ignoring the horror genre. His performance as both \"Stack\" and \"Smoke\" was phenomenal, giving each character a distinct persona that remains true to their individuality. Jordan's dual role was powerful, complemented by Coogler's bold and in-your-face bloody direction, making their team-up a one-of-a-kind.This film is a risk for Ryan Cooler as he hasn't done any films that are not inspired by or based on a different narrative. \"Sinners\" is all original and unique, which proves my point that Ryan is one of the greatest directors we have today. His fearless storytelling, which skillfully addressed racial discrimination and greed, was powerful. It's the kind of risk worth trying, and Coogler masterfully blends the elements of horror and drama through music and blood.The first hour of the film may be a bit long and dragging to some viewers, but it's the kind of characterization needed for this kind of film. Coogler cleverly built a world for these characters, allowing us to see them and their lives before the dreaded night. Coogler allowed the viewers to understand each character and their motivations, making the film's first half pivotal. Once the film reaches its second part, it's where all the blood and chaos occur, and the journey leading up to this moment is worth it.\"Sinners\" also shines in its visual and sound brilliance. There's a sequence in the film where the character played by Miles Caton, named \"Sammie,\" sings a song that showcases various transformations in music, from classic to modern. It also features music from different cultures and races. This scene is the moment when you can say that \"Sinners\" is probably the best horror film in recent years; it was like a spiritual awakening. The way Coogler cleverly conveyed the film through music is impressive; the music was not just an element added for extra flair, but rather, it was pivotal and interconnected with the story. Music and storytelling are interconnected; one cannot exist without the other, and that alone is a testament to Coogler's brilliance.\"Sinners\" is a film where everything was given to us, the viewers, from exceptional performances to excellent visual and audio storytelling. It's a film where all the elements of horror, drama, and music come together because Coogler's heart and dedication were in it. I have been waiting for this in the horror genre, specifically in the vampire subgenre. It's fresh and unique, yet still true to the gore and bloody nature of a film about vampires and its allegory."

The movie reminded me of from dusk till dawn, In the sense that the first half of the movie feels like a completely different movie than the second half. It's kind of like two movies in one. However the main difference is this one has so much meaning and substance. From dusk till dawn is one of my favorite movies. This is very different, in many ways i've never seen something quite like this. What I mean by that is, horror movies don't usually have so much heart and substance. The twins were complex, they loved and protected thier women but they were also tough guys with a heart of gold. They also really loved each other and had such a strong sibling relationship. They were smart, but flawed in a human way. This showcased black culture beatifully. It was never preachy, everyone could get into it. The brothers had layers to them. This is one of the best movies Michael b jordan has been in, his performance in this was one of his best. He was charamasic, he was a damn star. This movie made me laugh and cry. As well as jump from fear. It was so unique and interesting. The music had me, the cast was diverse and everyone brought something special. This is a must see, it was done so well. I don't understand how anyone could score this low unless they have bad intentions. I know there are people who can't stand to see a movie like this do well. But if you're being honest and not coming from a place of hate or jealousy, this was extraordinary. This is a solid movie and it is unique. It's kind of a musical, drama, love story and a horror story all in one. Something like this could easily become convoluted but it doesn't. This was done so well, I'm hoping for part two. Stay in your seats until the credits stop rolling because there are surprises everywhere. It's like it never ends."

Jordan-and yes, I even went to the theater alone because so many people said they couldn't get into the idea of a \"Black vampire movie.\" But wow... it was phenomenal.I'll admit, at first I was wondering why the pacing felt a bit slow, and I kept asking myself if it even was a horror movie. The whole twin dynamic didnt work with me...UNTIL IT DOES and it is oh so perfect. But once everything started coming together, it all made sense.The culture. The history. The raw emotion. The script and dialogue. The music. I cannot say this enoug--THE MUSIC. I truly love what they did here. They so perfectly incorporated a great concept and blended it seemlessly into the movie. And the aspect of --not just blue music. The scene where you had a group of planation works singing an Irish job! The violins and instruments. The graphics and CGI. It wasnt too much it wasnt over the tip. Everything was perfect. I can't even express how powerful and soul-stirring the music. It pulled everything together in the most beautiful way.The acting? Incredible. The story? So layered. The directing? On point. I'm already planning to see it again. I need to.Honestly, this movie wasn't just entertainment-it was an experience. I cannot remember the last time I left a theatre and felt this excited about cinema!"

          "content": "This is one of those movies that is a genuine experience.It's about a pair of twins - Smoke and Stack, both played by Michael B Jordan - who return to Mississippi from their life of crime in Prohibition-era Chicago to set up their own speakeasy.A lot of the first hour is taken up by their preparations for their grand opening, especially recruiting their prized musicians - their prodigy guitar-playing cousin Sammie and local blues legend Delta Slims. Opening night arrives, and it seems to be going perfectly ... except that the devil's music has drawn some unwelcome guests.There's one scene worth the price of admission on its own, and I bet everyone will know it when they see it - Sammie soloing on his guitar while everyone dances around him, time seems to merge all together while flames lick across the juke joint. It's a stunning piece of filmmaking.What else?Obviously, the soundtrack is great - blues, country, traditional folk. The vampires provide plenty of seductive menace, and Delroy Lindo as Delta Slims brings just enough of a comic touch to relieve the tension.And oh boy, is there tension.As I said at the top, seeing this movie is a genuine experience."

And seeing it with a good sized crowd adds so much to the experience.Just have to mention, again, the scene at the juke club when Sammie sings \"I Lied To You.\" Just a bold, transcendent cinematic choice by Coogler.The brilliance of the script, the layers to the story, the texture of the visuals, the portrayal of the characters, every note of the bluesy/southern gothic score, elements of generational trauma, the genre blending, culturally rich...everything so intricately crafted & put together to evoke contrasting ideas; the duality of man.The decision to name the twins Elijah & Elias is something I didn't catch the first time watching this. But that little detail adds so much more contextually to the story & theme (duality of man). Elijah (or Elias), in the Bible, was a prophet & miracle worker.Elijah embodied the duality of the human experience-boldly confronting evil while wrestling with despair. His story underscores the conflict between divine truth and human corruption, tying into broader themes of human nature.Coogler's visual references to the story of Elijah were subtlety placed but so well done, for example...BIBLE: Elijah called down fire from Heaven, multiple different times, to demonstrate God's power. One time he did it to consume a captain & his soldiers.MOVIE: Remmick & everyone that was turned to a vampire were consumed & destroyed by fire.Maybe I'm reaching, but I wonder if Sammie (Miles Caton) is a reference to Samuel from the Bible, as well. Samuel's story complements Elijah's, born sinners, called by God, & constantly confronted with the complexities of their humanity within leadership roles - natural impulses vs God's will, obedience vs rebellion, etc.Not to suggest this film is a 1:1 translation of those stories, but rather the broader themes & nuances of each man's story were adapted to fit the film's main narrative of the human condition.Also, where there's fire, there's Smoke...ba dum\n---\nRyan Coogler tapped into something truly special & unique with this addition to his filmography. This movie should definitely be up for a lot of awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Original Screenplay, Best Score, Cinematography, Acting categories etc."

He is quite amazing in this film! I'm usually not into movies that are over 2 hours long, but I didn't feel the length too much this time; this is a film with good pacing as well. I HAVE to shout out the music in this film again! It's such a massive tribute to the Blues and how intertwined it is to black culture as well. This film better win some awards!I love seeing these original Black films succeeding, so I HIGHLY recommend people go out and support this."

It was Multi genre brilliance. 1930s Mississippi racial tension piece mixed with blues, African and Irish music and a dark twist of vampirism. It should not work, but it does. I LOVED the music. Two hilarious lol moments. First - not a spoiler - Jack O Connell's 'character' and all his ilk doing the Irish jig to the brilliant folk song. Second - too much of a spoiler so won't say much - but post coital 'girlfriend' saying to one of the twins \"Smoke - it's not what it looks like\" was genius 😂 loved it, loved it, loved it. Thought it might go all From Dusk til Dawn on me, which I thought was a good film until it got ridiculous. Not a bit of it - when it all went mad the film got even better.

It also stayed on track with traits of other vampire movies such as they can't come in unless you invite them in and the sunlight killing them.

Ryan Coogler did a great job directing, Ludwig Goransson did an amazing job on the soundtrack, the acting of Michael B Jordan and Miles Canton is just magnificent, and the comedy from Delroy Lindo is actually funny, and also Jack O'Connel also did a great job acting as his part he is also a really good singer Miles Canton as well, finally Hailee Steinfeld also did a great job the accent is really good.

They buy a disused sawmill to use as a juke joint (speakeasy/nightclub) where they will showcase local musical talent and, hopefully, make pots of money. And all is going well until the arrival of several individuals who, keen trailer watchers will tell you, are vampires.Written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Black Panther) and starring Michael B Jordan, this is a vampire movie, a period piece, a Black movie, a social commentary, and a musical. I'm an old white English bloke, and my expectation going in was that, notwithstanding my enjoyment of horror films, the period, location and culture weren't going to have a lot to say to me. The fact that I only understood about one word in three didn't help - I now know how Americans watching Scottish films feel.But this is very, very good filmmaking. The storytelling is so good that you don't need the dialogue: the plot and character dynamics are obvious from what's on screen. The sound and, especially, visuals are remarkable. And the performances, even down to the bittiest of bit parts, are stellar.It's possible to criticise the film for being a bit of a mish-mash, for not knowing what it wants to be. But when those disparate elements work so well together, as they do here, I think we can take it that that was the filmmaker's intent.This film is someone's vision, brilliantly realised."

I was persuaded to see it because of the reviews.Just got back from the theater and I must say I am pleasantly surprised. The movie is a mixture of suspense, action, with bits of horror to tie it together. I must say the movie starts off with the opening scene that gives us some exposition as to who the film is named after , Sinners.However, the tone shifts from a homey and rustic southern town to a more gritty and debaucherous tone.The acting was actually a lot better than I was expecting. Solid performances throughout and some good character moments from each cast member.However, the real star of the show was the score. Man-o-man the music in this film is so great and to me adds depth to each scene.There is one scene where the party-goers are all dancing and the amount of work needed to set the scene without it becoming somewhat convoluted; really paid off.The vampires were sort of used as allegory for whiteness and its ability to seduce those poc/black people who feel ostracized by it. I think they work but I would've loved it if they maybe added an extra 10 minutes to maybe flesh them out a bit more. However, in spite of all that the character of Remmick was actually a stand out. He isn't your stereotypical vampire; he works more so as foil to Smoke and Stack.All-in-all a solid work from Coogler, Ludwig, and Arkapaw."

This original film from Writer/Director Ryan Coogler is exactly what movie theater audiences have been clamoring for. My theater was packed, and that's an achievement worthy of note in the age of massive IP. Not only is it an original idea, but it's actually a well-made film. Solid performances from a stacked cast led by Michael B. Jordan in dual roles as twin veterans-turned-gangsters The Smokestack Twins, Hailee Steinfeld as Stack's spitfire first love Mary, Wunmi Mosaku as Smoke's estranged hoodoo wife Annie, and Miles Caton as the twin's Blues' singing cousin 'Preacher Boy' Sammie Moore. Caton deserves special recognition as not only was this his feature film debut, but he directly contributed to my favorite part of this movie, the music.My gosh the music throughout this film is electrifying, it's enrapturing, and it completely elevated the movie as a whole. I've always considered myself Blues-adjacent in terms of music taste, some of my more recent favorites being closer to said genre of music. But this made me want to dive head in, the best, the genuine soul found in it felt like a breath of fresh air. Composed by Ludwig Göransson, Coogler's frequent collaborator and also famous for composing Christopher Nolan's most recent work, the score and soundtrack bring the entire story to life on the screen, getting blood pumping and hearts racing.Overall, this is not only a good film, it's one that I'm excited to revisit upon rewatch and one that I will definitely be owning upon Blu-Ray release. And you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that soundtrack and score on repeat for the foreseeable future.Full Review to follow."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is a genre-bending Southern Gothic horror film that cements his status as one of the most visionary directors of his generation. Set in 1930s Mississippi, the film weaves together elements of historical drama, supernatural horror, and musical transcendence to deliver a cinematic experience that is both emotionally resonant and visually stunning.Plot and PerformancesAt the heart of Sinners is the story of twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in a dual role. Fleeing their violent past in Chicago, the brothers return to their hometown with aspirations of opening a Black-owned juke joint. Their cousin, Sammie Moore (Miles Caton), a gifted blues musician, becomes central to their plans. However, their dreams are threatened by both the overt racism of the Ku Klux Klan and a more insidious supernatural force embodied by the vampire Remmick (Jack O'Connell) .Jordan's portrayal of the twins is a masterclass in acting, showcasing his range and depth. The supporting cast, including Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaku, and Delroy Lindo, deliver compelling performances that enrich the narrative. Notably, newcomer Miles Caton shines as Sammie, whose musical prowess becomes a beacon of hope and resistance.Visual and Musical AestheticsCoogler's direction is both ambitious and meticulous. Shot on 70mm film, the movie's visuals are rich with sultry hues that capture the essence of the American South. The cinematography, combined with the film's production design, immerses viewers in a world that is both haunting and beautiful .The film's soundtrack is a standout, blending Delta blues with elements of hip-hop and folk. A pivotal scene in the juke joint, where Sammie's performance invokes ancestral spirits, is both a visual and auditory spectacle. This sequence, achieved through a collaboration between composer Ludwig Göransson and artist Raphael Saadiq, exemplifies the film's innovative approach to storytelling .Themes and ReceptionBeyond its supernatural elements, Sinners delves into themes of redemption, identity, and the enduring power of music. Coogler uses the horror genre as a lens to explore the African American experience in the early 20th century, addressing issues of racism, community, and resilience.Critically, the film has been lauded for its originality and depth. It boasts a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with reviewers praising its genre-defying narrative and compelling performances . While some critics note that the film's ambition occasionally leads to narrative complexity, the consensus is that Sinners is a bold and successful venture into new territory for Coogler .ConclusionSinners is a testament to Ryan Coogler's evolution as a filmmaker. By intertwining elements of horror, history, and music, he crafts a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Michael B. Jordan's dual performance, combined with the film's stunning visuals and evocative soundtrack, make Sinners a standout cinematic experience in 2025.For audiences seeking a film that challenges conventions and offers a rich tapestry of themes and aesthetics, Sinners is a must-watch."

Damn, one of the best parts of the movie is when the guitarist starts to play!Michael B. Jordan and all the rest of the cast do an amazing job. The way the characters behave is very truthful and I was missing the classic version of vampires that we can fully appreciate in this movie.Besides, the movie is a mixture of great sound, great acting, great comedy, great ambient, great timing and great filming. All is great. Indeed, is...Absolute cinema 🤘🏼"

This film should be watched on IMAX and I must say the acting is on par with the musicalization, the build up to the climax and the raw emotions are really well portrayed to the intention of what they want to share with the viewers: love, grief and hate. The way they manage to create an atmosphere surrounding old stories about ancestors and how music carry those stories throughout time and they are linked to cultures and the context of that time, it is a marvelous execution. Music indeed is timeless and this movie managed to portray that escence."

          "content": "Ee now for me.... Sinners isn't just a horror film, it's a spiritual movement dressed in blood and rhythm, boy I tell ya..On the surface, it's a vampire story set in 1935, but underneath? It's an exploration of Black legacy, artistic resistance, and generational trauma. The vampires are a metaphor(or something I just can't see it atm), but they're also a decoy because the real monsters show up in white hoods(or so).What starts as a survival tale becomes a cultural reckoning, and by the time it pivots into its final form, you realize: this was never about the vampires. It's about how we build, love, create and how that creation is always at risk of being stolen or burned down. The camera lingers on faces like memories. The music transcends time. And that guitar....man that guitar.Haley and Michael deliver a performance that floored me. And Sammy(miles), the chosen one, he's not just a character. He's a symbol for all of us who carry the dream even when it's cracked in our hands. The final act feels like a fever dream, ghosts, symbolism, all leading to a painful truth, we survive the monsters just to face the real demons.This film ain't perfect, but it doesn't need to be. Because it dares to say something real. And as a Black viewer? It hit. Deep. Like ancestral deep. I gotta sit with it. Rewatch it. Let it keep haunting me in the best way."

          "content": "It's great to see Ryan Coogler not tied down to a franchise for once. You can really feel the creative freedom he had with Sinners, and it results in something that feels fresh, moody, and very him. He brings his usual depth and flair, but in a world that's darker, weirder, and honestly just really cool to watch unfold.Michael B. Jordan is back as his go-to lead, and he absolutely smashed it playing the twins. At points I genuinely forgot it was the same actor in both roles-he gave them such different energy, and the way their dynamic plays out is one of the film's biggest strengths.Jack O'Connell as the villain was a nice surprise too. I've been watching him for years and always felt like he deserved more spotlight. This role gave him room to show just how good he really is-he brought this unpredictable, dangerous energy that had me hooked every time he was on screen.What I really loved was the way they stuck to traditional vampire lore-silver, garlic, the invite rule, sunlight, stakes-but gave it a new twist. It didn't feel like a throwback or a parody, just a really slick modern take that respected the roots.It does slow down a bit in parts, and there were a few scenes where I felt like it could've moved along faster. But honestly? The acting, the characters, the visuals, and the music (blues has never sounded so good) kept me totally locked in.All in all, I really enjoyed this. It's stylish, different, and filled with strong performances. I'll definitely be watching it again once it drops on streaming or disc."

          "content": "There are certain movies I watch where from essentially the first scene I'm totally on board with the vibe of it. I have no problem with discovering my love for a film over the course of it's runtime but I just love that feeling of being in the hands of master from the first shot and that was exactly my experience with Sinners. I've really liked what Ryan Coogler had done with a true life story and with existing IP but I've been dying to see something that's truly his own and if this movie is any indication we have a new master who's on the cusp of a truly legendary career.Because I was engaged with this film from very early on and Coogler uses a smart framing device that allowed for that intrigue I had to grow and grow as the movie went on. It's very much a film of two very distinct halves with two very different genres and it really shouldn't work but it just does. Despite only taking place over the course of one day the world Coogler creates feels so lived in and the characters themselves manage to feel so rich in their back stories. When the script plays out as a gangster film it is so engaging to watch, the dialogue is unbelievable and it introduces the characters in such a seamless way but it manages to build them up without ever seeming too expository. The tonal shift into the vampire aspect came across as a little bit abrupt to me but once I got used to it I loved seeing the aspect of the story play out. It's not only intense, it's genuinely terrifying at points and because Coogler takes the time to build up the characters it always feels like there's real stakes at play.The visual effects in the scenes with 2 Michael B. Jordan's is seamless but the effect only enhances the performance that's already there. He is outstanding in the ways he conveys the little differences in both the characters and I loved the direction their relationship goes in which is aided massively but the Miles Catton character who is 100% worthy of all the acclaim he's receiving for this movie. He's the heart of the movie and his presence is really what lends the film most of its emotional weight. While I questioned the idea to put the conclusion of his arc as a mid-credits scene it still ended up being the best scene in the movie for how genuinely profound and how heartbreaking it was. This is very much a movie where everyone is great and could be argued as a scene stealer. But in particular Delroy Lindo manages to be hysterically funny and deeply affecting, often at the same time, and Jack O'Connell gives the best work I've ever seen from him in a character I just loved seeing chew the scenery.Ryan Coogler's breakdown of the different uses of aspect ratios for this movie really forced me to pay attention to it more than I usually would have. This movie feels enormous in scope despite being fairly small scale and I absolutely loved the way Coogler directed this movie. The whole thing just flows so well and some of those aspect ratio changes genuinely gave me goosebumps. I know it's only April but I could truly see this being the film that walks away with the cinematography Oscar. We talk about actors and directors being chameleon-like in their style but Ludwig Göransson has a range in his score like no other composer I've seen. Music is such an integral part of this story to the point where I struggled at points to distinguish which of his score was diegetic or not. It fits in with the visuals so seamlessly and as someone who's never had much of an infinity towards the blues this film makes me want to get into it more.The film balances so many different distinctive styles and it's hard not to be in awe of how well Coogler pulls it off but I'd be lying if I said everything about it felt smooth. The way the actual vampire element is introduced is very abrupt and I think the script could've done a better job at building up to that aspect. I also felt like the actual abilities these creatures possessed could've been established a bit better and while the actual climax was extremely satisfying I couldn't help but feel aspects of it were resolved too easily.Sinners ended up feeling like a bit of a miracles of a movie to me. It takes such a skilled hand to pull of this many distinctively different genres in a coherent way and with Ryan Coogler at the helm he manages to create something that not only feels wholly unique but kind of groundbreaking. Every single technical and performance aspect feels as if it's operating at the highest possible level and the script is so impressive in almost every aspect. As someone who's been wanting to see Coogler do something like this for a long time he did not disappoint in the slightest. If he wants to leave IP behind all together and produce original content like this full time I'd be absolutely elated and he is without a doubt one of the most exciting current filmmakers."

          "content": "It's not a nice feeling when you don't connect with something as strongly as most people seem to, but it's better than not connecting with it at all. To say I didn't like 'Sinners (2025)' quite as much as the majority of people seem to is to start this review on an unnecessarily negative note. I didn't like it as much as the general consensus suggests I should have, but I did like it. In fact, I like it more the longer I sit with it.Ryan Coogler's return to R-rated cinema is a bold, bloody, bracingly original blockbuster that confidently blends genres and emerges as more than the sum of its parts. In essence, it's a bit like 'From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)', with its most stark plot elements interrupting the journey it sets up in its first half and all but hijacking the experience for the remainder of the runtime. It isn't as much about its most advertised concept as you may expect, being just as interested in its musical roots and its twin protagonists' business venture as it is in the more sensational blood spilling which occurs in the third reel. The front half of the affair is entirely dedicated to setting up its characters and establishing their goals, immersing you in its world and making sure you care when parts of it are inevitably torn to pieces. This slow-building approach works well, but sadly the overall pacing is a little clumsy at times. What I mean is that the movie feels as though it starts wrapping things up just when they're at their most intense, spending much more time in the buildup to and aftermath of its most prominent genre elements than it does basking in their pulse-pounding glory. Perhaps it won't be as detrimental on a rewatch, when expectations are tempered and you're more likely to appreciate each moment for what you know it to be, but it certainly left me feeling slightly underwhelmed the first time round. Still, I suppose it's better to leave them wanting more than wishing for less, and this certainly leans firmly towards the former desire.One thing the feature definitely doesn't fumble is its aesthetic. With clean, shot-on-film cinematography and keen eye for composition, the feature crafts a palpable atmosphere that practically seeps into the cinema. It perfectly recreates its 1930s period, with set design and costuming that makes you feel like you've been transported through space and time. The world is tangible, built out of wood and nails rather than pixels and polygons. The only slightly iffy thing about it is the fact that it's very dark, even during the day scenes. It's not a major issue, but it does dampen the impact of some of the most striking imagery. Still, this is a beautiful picture with some stunning shots sprinkled throughout its runtime. It's also a total treat for the ears, a celebration of Black music across the ages. Its moody score is fantastic, mixing Southern-lilted bluesy guitar riffs with ominous droning violins - and eventually even seamlessly incorporating other musical genres - to create a sinister yet toe-tapping tapestry that exudes history, heritage and is wholly distinct. Furthermore, its song choices - both existing and created - effortlessly blend with the vibe crafted by the non-diegetic music to transport you to a time and a place you've never been to, immersing you in a celebration of the community-creating, barrier-breaking power of song. To divorce this feature from its music is to deprive it of its identity, and I've rarely seen or heard something that goes together quite as cohesively as the visual and aural parts of this.The piece is very well cast, with an exciting ensemble of talent both new and established. Among the highlights are Miles Caton, Wunmi Mosaku, Hailee Steinfeld, Omar Benson Miller, Jayme Lawson, Li Jun Li, Jack O'Connell and, of course, the one and only Delroy Lindo. Taking the reins in the leading roles is Michael B. Jordan, who portrays the Smoke/Stack twins who endeavour to set up the Juke joint which serves as the setting for the majority of the narrative. While Jordan is really good, he isn't massively convincing when it comes to portraying two distinct characters. To be fair, that's perhaps more of an issue with the writing, but the fact still remains that the twins are too similar to one another. Their visual integration is seamless, and impressively flexed in a number of sequences involving complex camera moves and on-screen interactions between them, but they're played basically the same and their personalities only differ in subtle ways. Perhaps most real-life twins do share a similar set of attitudes and behaviours, but movie twins need to feel like distinct characters and not just duplicates of one another (especially when they're played by the same actor). There are some scenes in which it isn't immediately obvious which twin is which (especially once they lose their helpfully colour-coded caps), and this isn't done for any particular effect. It takes a minute or two for context clues to make it clear who we're seeing, which isn't long enough for it to be a massive problem but isn't short enough for it not to be emblematic of a wider weakness. It's a minor flaw, though, and the characters are interesting despite their similarities (and, in some ways, because of them).Although I don't think there's enough of it, the action is really satisfying. When stuff hits the fan, it hits the fan hard. There are plenty of exciting set-pieces, each of which erupt from segments of rising suspense, and they're surprisingly gruesome at points. Honestly, some of it is almost guaranteed to make you wince. The choreography is mostly clean and entertainingly blunt, even if some hand-to-hand segments are a little too shaky for their own good, and the violence always feels impactful, primarily because it almost always occurs to well-established characters we care about. It's not just carnage that gets the set-piece treatment, though, as we're afforded a lot of time to experience and enjoy the wild night out its characters partake in. Sadly, I accidentally went to the toilet for most of the scene everyone is raving about, but I returned in time to see the final third of it and managed to piece together more-or-less exactly what it was I missed out on. I wish I could have seen it in its entirety, even if I don't think it would raise my estimations of the overall affair too much, but the bits I did see still seemed fresh and inventive and rejuvenating.Generally, this thing knows exactly what it's doing. Once you accept that it isn't all building up to its finale, but is instead telling a specific story that eventually implodes into said finale, you come to appreciate its slow-burn mentality and portentous underpinning. It immerses you in its setting, enriches you with its music, introduces you to its characters. It does the work to make you care so that its last act can hit as hard as it needs to. Ultimately, it's structured and paced really effectively. Its extended epilogue maybe feels a tiny bit out of place, but it's still fun and caps things off in an unexpected yet appreciated way. It does muddle some theming ever so slightly, and it also misses out on the opportunity to tie everything together with one more formalistic showcase, but it's a nicely novel way to cap off a tale that's never quite what you expect it to be.In the end, I definitely like this more the longer I sit with it. It's entertaining, unsettling, celebratory, unique, compelling, and expertly crafted in its every aspect. It has a palpable atmosphere all of its own, and it features some incredible music. It feels as though it's exactly what it wants to be, what it needs to be. While I do have some issues with it and don't connect with it as strongly as many people seem to, I still think it's pretty great. I certainly admire what Coogler and company are able to achieve with it, and I appreciate how original it is at a time when being so seems almost impossible in the blockbuster space. I actually want to watch it again, and fairly soon, which isn't something that's true of most movies released this year. It's a really good effort."

The cinematic and stylistic choices enhance the film's impact, evoking feelings of nostalgia, fear, sadness, and humor-all at once. \"Sinners\" elicits raw emotions. The casting is excellent, and the singing, acting, and choreography are all remarkable. Michael B. Jordan's performance is outstanding. I was initially skeptical of his ability to portray two characters simultaneously, but he exceeded my expectations.Ryan Coogler masterfully blends horror, thriller, musical elements, and history into a film that possesses a strong sense of identity. It achieves a great balance of humor while representing not only Black American culture but also Native American culture, Asian American culture, African traditions, and even Irish representation."

          "content": "It's always gratifying to see a filmmaker take a big step up in his or her career, and that's precisely what writer-director Ryan Coogler has done in his latest offering, a project that reflects a significant jump in the depth, artistry and sophistication of his creative output. Coming on the heels of his successes in \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" (2022), \"Creed\" (2015) and \"Fruitvale Station\" (2013), Coogler has hit a home run with this period piece smart horror story about identical twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who return to their Mississippi home in 1932 after years of working for Al Capone in Chicago, where they made huge money that they now plan to use to open their own juke joint in a converted sawmill. It's an opportunity where they hope to make even bigger bucks while helping to promote their talented cousin, Sammie (Miles Caton), a blues musician who's a killer guitarist and vocalist. But, as this ambitious trio launches this effort, they're confronted with a variety of challenges, including ghosts from their past, the perils of deeply ingrained social prejudice, the dual-edged sword posed by creative and financial success, and, most menacingly, mystical forces that may be more than they're capable of handling. These narrative components combine to tell a captivating tale about a troubled time in the country's history, one made all the more ominous with the appearance of supernatural powers that simultaneously offer both potential promise and the prospects of tremendous evil taking root. In bringing this picture to life, the filmmaker has served up an entertaining and engaging offering, one replete with fine performances, superb production values, sharp-edged, perfectly timed comic relief, truly inventive, deftly orchestrated cinematography, and suitably restrained (graphic though not gratuitous) imagery. Admittedly, the screenplay could use some work in a few spots (most notably with tighter writing and clearer plot elaboration), but it also manages to successfully fuse the inherent nature of several genres, including drama, dark humor and smart horror, while also presenting a wealth of insights in an array of areas. Through this picture, it's easy to see how Coogler has appreciably upped his game as a filmmaker, one that bodes well for his future in the field. It indeed represents the revelation of a talent more profound than anyone has previously recognized or properly acknowledged. \"Sinners\" is a work that deserves to be remembered come awards season later this year. Let's hope that it is."

          "content": "Sinners (2025) is a visually rich, musically driven vampire drama set in the American South of the 1930s-and it's one of the more atmospheric genre entries in recent memory. Directed by Ryan Coogler, this film is a bold yet elegant fusion of Southern Gothic storytelling and traditional vampire lore, brought to life with style and passion.One of the film's standout aspects is its stunning production design. Mississippi during the Depression era is recreated with remarkable detail-from dusty streets to ornate interiors and haunting rural landscapes. The costume work is impeccable, richly textured, and era-accurate, contributing heavily to the film's immersive tone.The ensemble cast delivers across the board. Each character feels authentic, layered, and emotionally resonant. The vampires are portrayed with both brutality and nuance, leaning into classical mythology-though this strict adherence to traditional vampire rules might come across as slightly too safe for genre veterans hoping for something new.Ludwig Göransson's score elevates the narrative, offering moments of grandeur and quiet intensity. Impressively, the film includes multiple full-length musical performances, which never feel forced but instead enrich the film's emotional texture. These segments never tip it into full musical territory but serve as poignant storytelling devices.Despite its many strengths, Sinners does stumble slightly in pacing. The opening is drawn out and may test the patience of some viewers, though it pays off once the story takes hold. Coogler's direction remains confident throughout, with a clear vision guiding the film's tone, rhythm, and emotional depth.Final Verdict: If you're into stylized period pieces, emotionally resonant characters, and a fresh (yet classic) take on vampire lore, Sinners is worth your time. It's not groundbreaking in terms of mythology, but it's executed with such care and craft that it earns your respect."

An outstanding achievement of blues mystical vampire thriller that never over-welcome it's stay and a reminder of why cinema and art remains important.What Coogler has crafted isn't just an ordinary vampire tale, but a tale of cultural heritages, conflict, and the systematic themes of that time era together with blood, romance, and tension. Coogler's direction and writing successfully blends many of the storytelling and themes together which offers really engaging characters and powerful dialogue moments. You feel the atmosphere, the characters and the way the story is explored is satisfying and engaging without a single moment of boredom.The musical performances and score were some of the best musical composition and song-writing of this year, alongside with the perfect uses of sound designs and camerawork. The uses of music, setting and atmosphere were perfectly conducted to establish the theming, time era, and moments of where the characters are. Especially where one of the character performs blues music where it spans with all historical genres, period and cultures integrated in a one-take sequence was one of the most powerful sequences in the entire film.All of the performances are fantastic, especially Miles Caton, Michael B. Jordan, and Hailee Steinfeld who outshines their roles perfectly. I haven't seen Jordan and Steinfeld this strong and powerful in a movie in sometime and they both really shine with their best. Many of the costumes, uses of effects, and including some uses of effective scares were effective and strong.After seeing Fruitvale Station and Creed (Although not very big on Black Panther), I'm happy to see that Ryan Coogler is able to create something unique and original. Frankly, I say it's one of the best movies of this year so far."

Coogler not only delivers on visuals but also tells a story that beautifully blends Southern reality with vampire folklore. A phrase used amongst older southerns is don't take no wooden nickles and the way Coogler was able to incorporate that into the film was well executed.

Setting the story in 1930s Mississippi adds a fresh and unique flavor to the often oversaturated vampire horror genre. It was one of my most anticipated films of 2025, and it absolutely did not disappoint.The first half of the film is nearly perfect. The performance shifts into modern music felt unnecessary and slightly pulled me out of the experience. Additionally, the vampire mythology could have used a bit more depth and backstory to fully flesh out the supernatural threat. Still, the film is so well made that these issues are easy to overlook.Sinners is best experienced in a cinema, where its rich visuals and immersive sound truly shine. I'd rate it a near-perfect 8.7 out of 10."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is a cinematic masterpiece that redefines genre boundaries, blending southern gothic horror with rich cultural storytelling, and delivering an unforgettable experience that resonates deeply with audiences. Set in 1930s Mississippi, the film follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack, portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in a dual role, as they return to their hometown to open a juke joint, only to confront a terrifying vampire threat. Coogler's direction is nothing short of visionary, seamlessly merging elements of horror, action, and drama to create a narrative that is both thrilling and thought-provoking. The film's cinematography, led by Autumn Durald Arkapaw, is mesmerizing, utilizing 70mm film to capture the sultry hues of the Mississippi landscape, enhancing the film's atmospheric tension and emotional depth. The soundtrack, curated by composer Ludwig Göransson, pulses with intense musical energy, blending blues with surprising folk influences, further immersing the audience into the film's world. Performances are stellar across the board, with Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaku, and Delroy Lindo delivering compelling portrayals that add layers to the narrative. However, it is Miles Caton, in his role as Sammie, who stands out, bringing a fresh energy that captivates viewers. The film's exploration of themes such as colonization and cultural appropriation is both timely and poignant, adding depth to the horror elements and prompting reflection on societal issues. Coogler's personal connection to Mississippi, stemming from his family roots, infuses the film with authenticity and emotional resonance, making it a deeply personal and culturally significant work. Critics and audiences alike have lauded Sinners for its innovative storytelling and technical brilliance, with the film achieving a near-perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes, underscoring its widespread acclaim. Legendary filmmaker Spike Lee has also praised the film, describing it as \"the greatest experience\" he's had in a theater in years, highlighting its cultural impact and cinematic excellence. In conclusion, Sinners is a groundbreaking film that showcases Ryan Coogler's evolution as a filmmaker, offering a rich tapestry of horror, history, and heart that will leave a lasting impression on all who experience it."

          "content": "In \"Sinners\", Ryan Coogler delivers his most authorial, ambitious and mature film to date. In a daring mix of the supernatural, historical drama and musicality, the director, known for imprinting a strong signature on black culture in his previous works, such as Fruitvale Station and Black Panther, now ventures into uncharted territory: a period thriller with vampires and lots of blues. And on this journey, he once again teams up with his longtime partner, Michael B. Jordan, who shines in a double dose playing the twin brothers Smoke and Stack with a rare and magnetic dramatic power. The result is a movie that not only impresses with its form, but also with its density of content, with layers that speak of belonging, resistance and cultural heritage.The plot takes place in the United States in the 1930s, in the midst of Prohibition, and from the very first minutes we are transported to an environment that pulses with references to black American history, especially in terms of music, the structural racism of the time and social inequality. The setting is impeccable, from the costumes to the art direction, and the cinematography by Autumn Durald Arkapaw immerses the viewer in a dark, stylized and hypnotic atmosphere, where every frame seems designed as a living painting. Still, perhaps the film's greatest technical asset lies in Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack, which acts as a kind of pulsating soul of the work. The blues, as a language and narrative, runs through the characters' journey and becomes an almost mystical element, an ancestral force that dialogues with the pains and achievements of those who came before.Although the marketing sold the movie as a supernatural action experience, almost a reinvented vampire blockbuster, \"Sinners\" is actually a drama with a more contemplative pace and a narrative construction that demands commitment and patience. And once you understand that, everything starts to make sense. The film isn't interested in reinventing vampire myths with effects and crazy twists - although classic elements such as garlic, stakes and rituals are present - but rather in using these figures as a metaphor. The sect that opposes the protagonists, led by the character played with intensity by Jack O'Connell, functions more as a reflection of the oppressive white elites than as supernatural villains in themselves. They are the living representation of appropriation, control and exploitation of what doesn't belong to them.Michael B. Jordan delivers one of the best performances of his career, creating two characters who, although physically identical, have completely different souls, histories and energies. Smoke and Stack are built with delicacy and firmness, which shows not only the actor's skill, but also Coogler's sensitivity in directing and exploring their layers. But the cast doesn't just rely on Jordan. Hailee Steinfeld, as Mary, delivers a performance full of nuances, as does Miles Caton, making his debut with confidence and presence. The movie even gets it right with the supporting actors, all of whom have well-defined purposes, even if some have limited screen time.If there's one point where \"Sinners\" doesn't delve as deeply as it could, it's precisely in the supernatural elements. The mythology of vampires and their rituals are brushed over with style, but never fully explored. However, this choice seems more intentional than accidental. The focus here has never been on terror, but rather on social impact, the power of ancestry and cultural resistance. It is at this point that the film most differs from conventional productions of the genre and stands out as a work that seeks to provoke reflection much more than just entertain. And that in itself is a brave and very welcome choice.\"Sinners\" is a work that talks about blood, in both the literal and symbolic sense: the blood that connects, that denounces, that heals and that sings. It's about the pain of a people, but also about their strength and creativity. By interweaving the myth of vampires with the power of the blues and the weight of black American history, Coogler creates a film that may divide expectations, but that certainly marks its place as one of the most relevant and daring cinematic experiences of 2025 so far. It's cinema with an identity, a purpose and a pulse all of its own."

          "content": "Sinners is one of those films overflowing with ideas - and some of them are genuinely brilliant. The use of music as a mystical and identity-driven element, transcending eras and contexts, is astonishing. There's one particular scene, powered by this concept, that stands among the most memorable in recent years.However, despite its thematic strength, the film suffers from uneven execution. At times, the narrative structure feels like it was divided among different people, as if a school group had split the film into segments, each handled separately, and then stitched them together without much concern for cohesion. The first act, for example, sets up atmospheres and conflicts that simply fade away without any genuine payoff.The supernatural aspect, at times, feels disconnected from the whole - as if it borrows elements from other films and genres that don't quite serve the specific fantasy Sinners is trying to build. Instead of enriching the world, these moments often feel like fragments from different visions, stitched into a narrative that doesn't fully accommodate them.Likewise, the inclusion of the KKK feels more like an appendix - something tacked on after the climax, with little to no real impact on the narrative. It doesn't build tension, resolve anything, or meaningfully expand the film's central themes. Instead, it feels like an underdeveloped layer that struggles to justify its presence.In the end, Sinners is a film that's more interesting than it is good. There's a clear ambition to explore complex and unusual themes - and that ambition deserves recognition. But it needed more time, or perhaps more focus, for all these ideas to come together into a cohesive, well-connected script that could live up to the potential the film clearly shows."

Not too much gore either. There are a few sex scenes so not something for young kids.

If you haven't seen this movie please go and enjoy. Acting was powerful, michael's double role was phenomenal. The characters were well thought out. Music was very good. The story was well written. It's been a long time since I've seen a good vampire film and this suits us for this decade and time."

          "content": "You know when a movie has everything going for it-killer cast, a director with a strong track record, an intriguing premise-and it still somehow falls flat? That's Sinners. I really wanted to like it. A Southern gothic vampire horror set in 1930s Mississippi, blending supernatural horror with racial commentary? Sounds amazing on paper. But the execution? Oof. It's all over the place.Michael B. Jordan does his best, and honestly, he's one of the only things holding this movie together. His presence gives some scenes actual weight, but even he can't save a script that feels like it went through five rewrites and still forgot to add a heartbeat. Characters are introduced with so much dramatic flair, only to be completely sidelined or written out with zero payoff. Hailee Steinfeld is criminally underused. Delroy Lindo has maybe three scenes and feels like a ghost in a movie about ghosts.Tonally, the movie can't decide what it wants to be. It starts off as a gritty drama, shifts into a heist thriller, then tries to morph into supernatural horror-complete with a vampire villain who's barely explained and about as scary as a Halloween store prop. The social themes, which could've been the movie's strongest point, feel forced and preachy instead of integrated into the narrative. It doesn't make you think-it just kind of shouts at you.Visually, it's fine, but that's kind of the problem. It's just fine. For something so rooted in mood and tension, the cinematography and sound design are surprisingly bland. It's like they wanted the style of Blade but the substance of Get Out, and ended up with neither.By the time the credits rolled, I didn't feel scared, enlightened, or even entertained. Just disappointed. Sinners had something special in its bones, but somewhere along the way, it lost its soul."

          "content": "Sinners is an extremely rare original, R rated, big budget film from an auteur operating with what feels like complete creative control as different genres collide in a crowd pleasing horror film that absolutely delivers all the goods. It puts a fresh spin on the classic tropes of Vampirism which also directly links to what it's saying about artistic expression and colonialism whilst lovingly homaging the work of John Carpenter and being a love letter to the transportive power of the blues.Michael B. Jordan nails the duality of playing twins by convincingly portraying Smoke and Stack as two entirely different personalities who care about each other. Smoke is commanding and wise whereas Stack is more prone to making mistakes and is generally a lighter presence. Miles Caton is phenomenal thanks to his steely determination and youthful charm combined with a fantastic singing voice. All of that is made even more impressive considering it's his screen debut.The supporting cast is full of actors at the top of their game. Wunmi Mosaku and Hailee Steinfeld both have a uniquely palpable chemistry with Michael B. Jordan and it's especially satisfying to see how quickly Wunmi Mosaku understands the gravity of the situation. Delroy Lindo is having a ball getting some of the biggest laughs whilst still feeling like a three dimensional character and Jack O'Connell truly relishes the complex yet gleeful villainy of Remmick.Ryan Coogler's direction takes some seriously bold swings and is confidently methodical, properly taking its time to immerse you in this story so you care about the characters once the much bloodier horror moments begin to creep in gradually before eventually letting all hell break loose in a show-stopping finale. It also contains the most substantial end credits scene of all time that is basically the actual ending but it genuinely works better in this separated structure.Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography is consistently stunning and only gets better when it's in the glorious IMAX aspect ratio which is employed for a standout one take during the best musical sequence that transcends space and time. Ludwig Göransson's score is a character in itself and one of his best in a career almost exclusively full of genre defining work. It constantly oozes style with a broad range of styles contained in the one soundtrack."

It was an immediate success and people flock on its opening night BUT things will get down when a bunch of folk singing people came right by and ask for their own entry.THIS IS WACK. MY GOD.I cannot believe the hype for this.This literally starts with an 1h14m introduction (in my rough estimate) of BULLET POINT introductions. This was not even sprawling and noteworthy information at all, it was just pertinent information then next character. That was so long and ungodly elaborate for what's worth?It does not even really setup it quite well which was even more disappointing. I still was as removed as I was after the party started. That huge clump of messy ass introduction was at best a 15 minute montage AND it will be much more effective. I think of the group of character introduced - only the Wunmi Mosaku character is pertinent AND should have been expanded on. Everyone other than her is just there, and she got equal time in the introduction to the others. Talk about focus issues.Then the sinner's party happened.It faired better rated against the very low bar of the first half, but it was not least subtle thing you would ever watch. It hits all the the tropes of a race film and it was just trite mess. This is a film about Jim Crow America, it was so shocked with all that jazz. Like, it would be more surprising had the ending been white people helping them. It just does not make sense at all that they act like this racism is shocking or, want to be gun blazing when there was a very resolute solution or that they are falling with the bluff of it all. This was so stupid, that in fact, I was never ever more happy someone burns alive (also an unsubtle reference). My parents and I were so happy that people died lol.Also, Coogler never really find the tone and pace he wants to portray. This film actively tries to be hifalutin BUT It just is not. It was a middling horror, a trite drama, and bad suspense. It was entirely slow and confused in the first half, a bit more focused but lacking a coherent tone in the last half.This could have been a meaningful zombie film about the Jim Crow-ism but it was just gungho with the Marvel-ism and direct references that it flops to oblivion. Clearly, people are hanging on the Jim Crow parallels BUT WE NEED GOOD MATERIAL behind it. This was a bloated mess (like my writing).This is not recommended AND I did not even tap the \"why are they lit so darkly in the morning scenes\" commentary yet."

In this movie,\nJordan plays 2 roles as the twin brothers, Smoke and Stack. The best part is that both of them are shown simultaneously in the same frame, something that most movies can not pull off.OVERALL REVIEW:\nThis movie broke the barriers of high quality horror movies and movies in general. The music in the background score intensifies the movie and makes it even more thrilling!In my personal opinion, with all the movies released (so far), this movie has the potential to be the 2025 Movie of the Year!I would HIGLY RECOMMEND this movie to you!

Everything I read online about it leading up to the premier, pointed to it being at least an ok movie. So the next evening, I went for a first date with this girl to see Sinners. It did start out a tiny bit slow at first, but my friends don't know what the Hell they were talking about. I didn't have any opinion on Ryan Coogler either way, but after I seen Sinners, I really feel that man is a Hell of a director.

          "content": "The movie looks great, the acting is great and the story was a good idea but this could have been a really good movie but it drops the ball in several places.First, it didn't know what movie it wanted to be. A lot of themes are thrown in there, even to the point of having scenes just for them. MBJ's shoot out with the KKK guys? The musical numbers? Why show the future? And for so long. The Irish jig? That was so weird and didn't work at that point in the movie.Second, \"One Day Earlier.\" That ruins the movie right there for every movie that does it. This has plagued Hollywood for a number of years. The opening is so far removed from the rest of the movie and it takes so long to even hint at it that at some point I'm distracted wondering when we're going to get there. You see that resonator guitar and know it's gonna get broken every time you see it. Instead of taking in that his cousin just gave him Charley Patton's guitar I keep thinking of it being broken and bloody and wonder how it's going to happen.Third, there were a lot of dumb little things. The vampires have to be invited? I know that's a troupe but I think we can all agree that it's stupid and was only used so our good guys weren't attacked right away. Then when they do charge in, they just open the door and don't invite them, they just charge in! And they know they just have to wait until sunrise, so why don't they do it!? Because having a big battle with the vampires was cooler than the practicalities of the story? Then in the fight in the puddle, MBJ walks past all of the vampires to kill the main one and none of the others stop him? They get the juke joint going in one day? They buy it, get the cook, the music and everything that day? Why did it have to be one day? And the KKK let them have it so they could go kill them the next morning? And MBJ was ready with his weird Punisher trap? That was insane. And unnecessary for the movie. Wouldn't the KKK just come at night with the chances of people being there were much higher? I get the symbolism or the message or whatever but it wasn't handled very well at all. It was either crammed in last minute or was just written by someone lacking the talent to do it effectively.I am a Blues nut so that was a nice surprise. Seeing Buddy Guy was jarring, not because that scene was weird as hell but because Buddy has a very high voice and the actor had a very deep voice. But if I didn't know Buddy so well I wouldn't have known that. And since he is the last of the authentic Blues it's nice to see him."

So I decided to head to my nearest theater and check it out. Unfortunately, I think the hype train hurt my viewing experience. I would have enjoyed it much more going in blind. This movie is good, but not to the certified classic level like some are making it out to be.This movie looks and sounds amazing. The cinematography, set and costume design, and the score are top notch. The film really transports you to the Jim Crow south. The acting is also very good from an impressive cast of both major Hollywood names and newcomers.My issues with the film center around the writing and the plot structure of the film, particularly in the second half. The buildup to the night was well executed, but it falls off the rails once the vampire threat begins. The biggest problem the script has is that it sets up the rule that vampires must be invited in. They had a very hard time working around this rule in a convincing way.The first instance this happens is when Mary (played by Steinfeld) at the request of the twin brothers, leaves the music establishment to investigate a trio of vampire musicians to see if they have any cash on them. They need the cash because the establishment is not doing well financially even though it is opening night. Seems like a flimsy excuse to put this character in danger so she can be turned into a vampire.The second time this happens is right before the vampire showdown. A secondary character gets over anxious and just yells for the vampires to enter, despite the fact that the sun is about to come up in about 15 minutes. It's lazy writing that could've been solved with another pass on the script.The entire climax of the film is extremely disappointing and was a major letdown for me. One of the best characters sacrifices himself even though it makes absolutely no difference. Then the movie has like 4 different endings that drag things out longer than necessary. It's also not a very good horror movie, there aren't really that many scares.This is a good movie that doesn't stick the landing. Temper your expectations and you will have a good time with it."

Better than 'Blacula', writer/director Ryan Coogler's 2025 feature film (close to 140 minutes) is a slow burning tale which only get's going in it's second half, when the often rather OTT action/horror scenes get going (including a ridiculous climactic shootout). In fact you half to muster a fair amount of suspension of disbelief, and not just for the film's supernatural elements, as we have, amongst other things, two surprisingly 2025 'brothers' bouncing around early 30s Mississippi. It still has it's moments though, and an ambiguous take on the whole notion of 'sin', as partly evinced by it's mid end credits sequence set in 1992 (missed by some early cinema leavers)."

          "content": "Sinners... is a masterpiece. I did not think that I would be saying those words specifically...but I am actually saying them. I simply cannot fathom how a movie this ambitious, this...honest was greenlit/approved/produced by a major Hollywood studio in that of Warner Brothers. I just can't believe this.I got so much more than I bargained for, I was not ready. Sinners is one of the most thematically dense, brutally candid, sultry, and ambitiously genre-bending films that I have ever seen in my entire twenty-two years of living thus far. It's like...From Dusk Till Dawn meets Lovecraft Country on steroids. There is just so much to unpack and deconstruct. There is so much to love and honor. There is so much to talk about and heal ourselves with. There is just....so much.The performances: off the charts, across the board. Michael B. Jordan is in a dual role here portraying Smoke and Stack, twins set in 1930s Jim Crow south Mississippi. I might be exaggerating here, but this may be Jordan's best performance thus far.The cinematography: nostalgically complementary and aesthetically satisfying. Everything from the dense colors, the framing techniques, the moody lighting, the close-ups, to the frequent breathing room was all so beautiful and pleasing to the eyes.The music: a star of the film in and of itself. Highly expressive and excruciatingly innovative, Ludwig Göransson's infectious, soulful score is genius. The merging of different genres through different decades and different styles was nothing short of a masterclass.The screenwriting and directing by Ryan Coogler: peerless. Unmatched. There are two things that may have led to the inception of this project: the cancellation of Lovecraft Country or his wrongful arrest after being accused of bank robbery. Either way, I believe Mr. Coogler has outdone himself here...just as a filmmaker alone. He has the blood of the culture pumping through his veins as he is not willing to sacrifice the implementation of nuances and symbolism in themes, character motivations, visuals, and even stories.Sinners, shockingly so, is a film that is chock-full of timely themes, heavy spiritual/religious undertones, expressive social commentary, et cetera. All of which is executed through the precise understanding of essential genre tropes. It's a film with multiple different interpretations to be discovered, but I think I have gathered what the film is trying to say on a holistic level.While it can be classified as a vampire film, the film itself forces you to marinate and dig deep into the psychology of mankind since the beginning of time. Ideas like how one can be saved using a prayer and religion that eventually was used to colonize and enslave specific groups of people. Nuances that include exposing the true darkness and revealing spiritual truth; how spirits need permission to operate and how often the tenets of the unseen are at play.Believing that a threat does not exist, when there always will be, never makes the threat perish. If you lack belief in said threat, that snake will come crawling up your leg while you are unprepared and naive of what's to come. That's why it is up to us, as human beings and individuals, to find our way home....to forge our own path to righteousness, independence, opulence, and freedom.Sinners is a mirror to a very specific journey. The journey of embracing religious, spiritual, and ancestral beliefs and of realizing their evident power of healing and protection. An unblemished, candid representation of faith within the Black diaspora. Ryan Coogler made this film with such colorful characters paired with wonderful performances, peerless direction, infectious energy, and marinating nuances. I feel like I am witnessing the future of cinema unravel right before my very eyes.I have seen this film twice now and I have cried each time. Get up off your ass and go see an original, contemporary blockbuster in theaters right now. I honestly think Sinners...is one of the best movies ever made."

But overall, the movie's gist is the question of how we advance while we cling to the past. Don't get me wrong; we should acknowledge our misdeeds if we want to correct them. But nonetheless, we have to look to the future.Maybe that's excessive analysis. The main point is that the movie does a fine job in every respect. It takes some real talent to have this kind of great music in an intense setting. Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaki, and the rest all put on excellent performances. This year is turning out to be an impressive one for horror movies, and I hope that Coogler continues his good streak."

The film's look and style also stand out - everything feels cohesive, stylish, and intense without seeming forced.

There are multiple scenes that I would include in the best movie scenes of the past decade and did I mention THE MUSIC!! A staggering mix of deep Southern blues, stunning thumping percussion and a very specific third ingredient which I won't spoil here but which fits so perfectly I can't imagine why it was never done before. Michael B. Jordan's duel turn as Smoke & Stack is both viceral and bleeding with heart but far from carries the film on his own shoulders, he's joined by an incredible supporting cast with standout turns from Miles Caton, the always awesome Delroy Lindo and Jack O'Connell But there are two stars shining brightest here, Ludwig Göransson has produced one of the great modern scores for Sinners, I didn't just hear the music, I felt it in my chest and still do even an hour after leaving the cinema, another Oscar must be on the horizon. Then there's Ryan Coogler who has written and directed not only one of the greatest vampire moments movies of all time but one of cinemas most stunningly original films in many years,"

          "content": "Wow. I'd heard good things about Sinners, but something striking from almost every review was this sense that this movie wasn't just good, but special. Special in that, it's a film with a unique and confident energy to it; a film that demands to be seen at the cinema, not at home.The most immediate thing about Sinners is the sound design and music. Not since Challengers (which also came out in Spring of last year, strangely enough) has a film floored me with its musical choices. There are moments in Sinners where it almost feels too loud, but it's entirely intentional: the music IS the story. To that end, Ludwig Goransson's score and the film's many songs are hypnotic. Listening to the soundtrack by itself, it's truly REMARKABLE how it expertly combines genres as diverse as blues to hip hop to Irish folk music to gothic orchestra. Insane. It feels like a celebration of music itself.The second thing I noticed was how apparent it was that this film was going to be a thematically rich one. There's a moment when Delroy Lindo's character, Delta Slim, is recounting a vicious tale of racist violence, and he transforms a deep sigh, clearly intended to hold back tears, into a triumphant melody. That moment, to me, is basically what Sinners is about: remembering culture, community, and humanity even in the face of tremendous evil. (In a movie wth so many people, Lindo stands out, both as comic relief, but as a magnetic, fascinating person who I honestly feel like I could listen to talk all day).The \"evil\" in question are of course, vampires. Had it not been for the second trailer, I'd have gone into this movie completely blind and I wish I had (my wife, luckily, did). This is the best vampire film in years. It intuitively understands that vampires work best as a metaphor for something else; from \"hedonism\" to \"cultural appropriation\" and \"assimilation\" to \"capitalism\"...there's no shortage of ways to interpret them here. This could've been a historical drama/action film about a black party attacked by a white mob; it still would've been great, but it's the supernatural aspects that really elevates Sinners.Top to bottom, Sinners is full of fantastic performances. Michael B. Jordan is one of Hollywood's greatest leading men. In a lot of ways, even though his performance as the Smokestack twins isn't mind blowing, he brings such natural charisma and energy to the role, that if you told me he was entirely unscripted, I'd believe you. It's insane how much swag and charm this man has, even if the characters he plays are morally scrupulous.Miles Canton was another highlight; in many ways, his character Sammy is the heart and soul of the film. Canton manages to convey a universal experience: that of a young man fighting for respect and recognition, but feeling unequipped to do so.Hailee Steinfeld is at her sultriest and sexiest, and I gotta say, it's almost impossible to leave this movie without a crush on her (and given what happens, that's impressive). But the other highlight, has to be Jack O' Connell.Despite having only a few scenes, O' Connell's vampire - Renmick - leaves such an incredible impression. He is the best on screen vampire in years; terrifying not because of his immense supernatural power, but his cunning and deviousness. He has the twinkle in his eye (literally and figuratively) of a gleeful hedonist, \"unburdened\" by morality.A lot of these great performances wouldn't be possible without Coogler's masterful direction; the moment when Hailee Steinfeld walks away from the vampires and Remnick flys up into the air (which lead to audible gasps in my theatre). It's something we all KNOW - yes, vampires can fly - but the way it was revealed was simply amazing. (Oh, and Goransson's AMAZING gothic score towards the end...chef's kiss.)While I think some may find the film's structure objectionable, I thought it was absolutely brilliant. The Jim Crow era South was exactly LIKE THAT; people could prepare for a nice night with friends and family, only to have it disrupted by the racist society around you. To want more of a \"build up\" betrays the point.This is a movie that has something for everyone. Do you want an exceptional vampire film? Do you want something deeper, using a simple premise to explore deep themes? Do you want a crowd pleasing film? A sexy, passionate one? It really ticks basically every box.If I had one complaint, I do feel the final moments leading into the climax needed...a little more. It feels weird to say given how obviously intentional every decision made here was, but I wish there was just a little more leading into the descent into chaos (although contrary to what people are saying, given the circumstances, the actions Li Jun Li's Grace took are perfectly understandable given the context).Sinners comes at a time when Hollywood is clearly stuck in a rut, both creatively and up until a Minecraft fuelled boost two weeks ago, commercially. I titled this review the \"first great American film of 2025.\" Not only because I don't want to ignore global cinema, because fundamentally, Sinners is a film about America and could've only been produced in America. In a world where we see more generic, copy-and-paste slop than ever before, Ryan Coogler has saved our souls."

When this began will surely be subject of debate (I am not a historian), but the age of Caucasian traders/ conquerors sailing the world, or the invention of evangelical Christianity, were likely pivotal. Of course, 'a fateful mark' is rather euphemistic, as the horrors inflicted upon communities small and large alike are impossible to catch in words and we remain to live with the consequences every day.\"Sinners\" by Ryan Coogler uniquely addresses this theme. Without taking an activist approach, Coogler explicates the effects of Caucasian dominance. It is never pedantic (which would have destroyed the movie, I think), but it is indeed quite confrontational at times, which left me filled with emotions. Especially the scene where the Church roof burns down, is a momentous artistic achievement and an ode the mankind.Being Caucasian myself, I was left with a feeling of guilt. But, what am I to do about present day suffering other than acknowledge and, where necessary, condemn this awful course of history? Is it even reasonable to feel guilty as a Caucasian, or was the course of history merely a fatalistic function of Darwinistic forces that could also have developed elsewhere? I was very curious to find out about the makers views on such questions. But, we don't quite get them, I feel. We observe on the existence and effects of intergenerational cultural conflict, but it is left for the sad thing it is. The second half the film is mostly a thrilling and visually appealing vampire story. Still very enjoyable, but less ambitious and long lasting, I would say.I would give 10/10 for bringing up the theme of intergenerational cultural conflict in such an entertaining film. However, without a binding conclusion, the debate is less constructive, and I'm mostly left with negative emotions on this topic. And, maybe that is what it is, but then again, in the greatest movies of all time such would have been solidified, I feel. I'll keep following whatever this director delivers, because he certainly has a talent for visual story telling. Thanks!"

It's an original and philosophic entertainment, but not exactly what I'd call a good film.Separated by the climactic one-shot where the soul-stirring blues conjures music and carnival across time, the movie is essentially two-part: the first built around storyful characters but demanding attention to heavy dialogue, the second classic horror with mediocre elements of sandbox and bloodshed. There's a clear jump from art film to commercial, most likely because Coogler spent too much time creating an allegory instead of figuring out how realistically the plot should move on. Hence there's a pretty obvious pacing issue with the latter half that can only be resolved by allowing an unconvincing crashout and a suddenly arrived finale. I understand the message of unwanted death by cultural intrusion and assimilation but that's no excuse for the reckless massacre without emotional buildup --- to see the correct way of killing off a group of protagonists, I recommend Train to Busan."

Ryan has crafted a well-told, gripping, and expertly crafted experience that shouldn't be missed.'Sinners' is one of the best horror films of the last few years, one of the best films of this year, and a must-see event in theaters.Brad: 9\nJosh: 9\nFinal: 9."

When I heard Ryan Coogler directed this film, I was in. I jumped and worried and mourned for the characters. I love that they showed a family of Chinese immigrants friends with the main characters. I love that they are twins. The same but also different. It had the same vampire lore but somehow seeing People of color turn to evil vampires made it real. The last vampire film I watched, Nosferatu, I wish I hadn't seen. This film I fully recommend. I could watch this again."

Not your average movie with the same plot twists etc. This is unqiue.The style that its been set in, complements the plot of the movie perfectly and the ending was very intense and I loved every minute of it. There is that theme of horror in this movie which I have never seen been implemented so uniquely and perfectly. Finally, the movie ends to a point where they have got to make a second movie to follow it up.When the director is the same director for black panther and creed 3, you know its gotta be good. Spend your money on this, its worth it."

They are on different level! Amazingly done, amazingly shot, amazingly performed, flawless, unique, extravagant, bold, weird..you will take them with you when you leave the movie...and the reason you must watch it in theater is in big part is related to them! You will not have the same experience if you watch it in your home..not the same feel..not with these amazingly made concept..you must experience it to understand..the stepping of their feets will become a carry home memory..Other great things about this piece is the real feel of the era..An outstanding acting performance, with extra iconic ones being Jack O'Connel, Lola Krike and Michael B. Jordan.Director Ryan Coogler was so bold in his approach and it paid off..he created something that is really memorable and original, at least in part of, although you can tell the inspiration and some similarity to \"from dusk till dawn\", but as I said, created in part masterpieces.Now with all of what have been said, why is the 7? The ending! I will not add much spoilers, but definitly the ending could be better...and during the movie, there is moments, although less moments, but they exist, where you feel Ryan is trying hard to add \"coolness\" effect and feels little dragged.In total, its a great one...if you didnt watch it in theater, go and watch..if its finished in theaters then make sure you watch it with great sound surrounding system..."

          "content": "Sinners - Ryan Coogler's new gothic horror film - lets us viscerally experience the horrors of racism endured by the Black community in America.Set in 1932 Mississippi, the story follows twin brothers Elia \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" (both played by Michael B. Jordan) as they return home from World War I to open a juke joint in an abandoned sawmill.But Sinners isn't just horror. It's an emotional, powerful drama that gives voice to collective fears, historical trauma, and one burning question: surrender - or fight?Things take a supernatural turn when the twins face a new threat: white vampires led by Irishman Remick (Jack O'Connell), who attack their club, reflecting the brutal racial violence of the time.One of the film's most impressive elements is its production design - largely practical and built specifically for the film - which adds authenticity and draws the viewer in. Still, a few scenes suffer from less convincing CGI, which becomes obvious only in hindsight and slightly disrupts the viewing experience.Another issue: Jordan plays both main characters, and the production chose to differentiate them with different colored hats - a solution that looks a bit silly when both appear on screen together, especially early on.Despite being categorized as horror, Sinners doesn't go for cheap jump scares. Instead, the fear it evokes is deeper - emotional, unsettling, and immersive.To be honest, I'm not usually a fan of gothic horror - it's just never been my thing.But somehow, Sinners broke through my reservations and won me over. Even if gothic horror isn't your usual genre - it's absolutely worth a watch. It's powerful, gripping, and maybe even important.And in my opinion? One of the best films of the year."

          "content": "I didn't really take all the hype around the movie seriously at first - everywhere you looked, people were calling it the best film of the year, a masterpiece, a genre revolution... blah blah. But then I watched it - and yeah, there's real substance behind the buzz. *Sinners* isn't your typical horror flick, even if the trailer kind of makes it look like one. If you're just in it for cheap jump scares and spooky nonsense, you're definitely in the wrong place. What you get here is something deeper: layered characters, a unique vibe, and a phenomenal atmosphere.Michael B. Jordan plays two roles - the Smokestack Twins - and it works surprisingly well. The first 45 minutes are a slow burn, but in the best possible way. It starts off quiet - but it's the kind of quiet that pulls you in. It's not just about the Smokestack Twins either, but also their cousin Sammy, who's this insanely talented musician. The three of them want to open a juke joint in the 1930s, and it becomes clear pretty quickly: this isn't going to be some shallow vampire beat-'em-up. This is a film that takes character development seriously. You get to know them, you feel why this dream matters so much to them, and as a viewer, you're emotionally invested before you even realize it.Then, around the halfway mark, the tone shifts - the vampires show up. But not in that lame \"Boo! I want to suck your blood!\" kind of way. It's more subtle, tense, intelligently done. One thing I especially loved was how they handled the classic vampire lore - like the \"you have to be invited in\" thing. That's usually just a gimmick, but in *Sinners*, it becomes this intense, nerve-wracking plot point.And then there's the music. Man. The music in this film isn't just a background element - it *is* the narrative. Sammy plays blues on a level that feels almost supernatural. There's one scene where he performs, and while he plays, you see musicians from the past... but also modern ones - a DJ with turntables, breakdancers, electric guitar. It was one of those moments where I sat there thinking, \"Okay, *this* is special.\"But - and this is my only real nitpick - that scene went on just a bit too long, and the break from the 1930s setting was a little jarring. I get what they were going for - showing a clash of times and cultures - but it kind of threw off the vibe for a second.What really caught me off guard, though, was the ending. The film spends all this time building up music as this powerful force - it connects eras, stirs emotion, even lures the vampires. I genuinely thought music would end up being the thing that saves everyone. But nope. In the end, it's still weapons and wooden stakes that settle everything. Sure, the action was brilliantly shot - bloody, intense, not over-the-top - but I was kinda hoping that music would be *the* key. It wasn't. Not a dealbreaker, but a bit of a missed opportunity.Still, the film sticks with you. Not because of the vampire angle (even though that's handled really well), but because it takes its characters seriously. You don't want anyone to die, because they feel like real people - not just horror movie cannon fodder. And that's rare. *Sinners* is creative, bold, atmospherically rich - and most of all, different. Not your run-of-the-mill horror, not just another vampire flick. It's its own thing. Maybe not perfect, but damn close."

But further danger awaits...This first half of movie felt like a period drama which quickly transported us into the 1930s. We learn snippets of the Brother's background which leaves us wanting to know more about the life they've lived. Although a slow build, the movie touches on several themes including the struggle Black individuals faced within the period both externally and internally.The horror element creeps in during the second half of the movie and whilst it couldn't match the quality of the first half, especially the third act, it remained on theme whilst providing moments of tension.Music plays a huge part in the film both for the viewers and the characters alike. Ludwig Goransson (Black Panther, Creed) joins forces with Coogler once again to provide a unique score. The musical elements highlights the power of song with one scene in particular being a standout. Sinners feels like a movie that will take you deeper with each watch as it weaves several themes and genres together with strong acting performances.Whilst I came for the horror and the action, it was actually the drama, characters and themes that I appreciated most."

The final act, however, was underwhelming and I don't think the film does a good job of explaining the antagonists, despite all the dialogue that it devolves into. The final showdown has a Dusk til Dawn moment then it feels like it's over before it begins in a fairly chaotic scene.It felt like a film of two halves, but apart from a couple of out of place comic relief moments, the performances helped carry it through.Stay for the post credits, it's a good scene."

As the night begins for a grand opening of the joint, evil too in the form of vampires arrive at the venue. After being denied permission to enter, they wait for the opportunity to come their way. As all hell breaks loose, how does they survive the vampire mayhem, forms rest of the story.What works fine is the aim to make a good old vampire film and clubbing it with music along with the cultural representation of that era. The sincere performances add onto the positives, making this a thoroughly engaging watch despite the slightly longer runtime. The main plot begins half way into the film so the slow building up of the story by introducing all the key characters with the right amount detailing pays off. The highlight will remain the climax scene and the post credits scene that elevated the entire viewing experience. The screen ratio on IMAX was not that satisfactory but the Juke Joint scene in all it's full glory was worth the money I paid."

The KKK is still around (has it even left?), and the brothers are setting themselves up to create a jazz-themed bar/club. The music's good. Is it a horror? A psychological film? A drama? It's got a bit of comedy in it. It's interesting. Different. A little mixed up. But enjoyable. I loved the scene is the music bar that was a nod to so many different styles of music genres. Was really interesting how they did that? Would i recommend it? Yeah. But come with an open mind. And don't leave the cinema until the black and white only credits roll."

The music and acting is wonderful but nothing was shocking because every moment the film uses for surprise is ruined by the trailers.

The same goes for most of the cast; rarely did I feel like I was watching actors rather than the actual people they were portraying.What pulled me out of the experience, though, was the sudden and strange addition of vampires. I wasn't quite sure whether the film was leaning into horror, satire, or something more surreal and symbolic. My girlfriend even got startled a few times, so clearly the tone did shift. But for us, it wasn't clear how we were supposed to interpret that shift - was it serious? Was it campy? Was it parody?What worked best for me was the historical and emotional weight behind the core story: the depiction of slavery, the cotton fields, the painful social reality for Black Americans, and the journey from the South to the North. These elements were powerful and well-handled. I honestly wish the movie had leaned more into that, because it carried real substance. Michael B. Jordan's dual role as a twin added to that thematic richness and fit well with the narrative.Overall, Sinners is a film that looks and sounds incredible and has the bones of something great - but the genre-mixing (especially the vampire twist) made it feel like Django Unchained met Scream or American Pie at times. Fun in moments, but tonally confusing."

Jordan delivering a standout dual role and the supporting cast adding real emotional weight. The vampire lore is fresh and intriguing, adding layers to a story already steeped in cultural richness and historical depth.What makes the film stand out is its tight, compact storytelling - no unnecessary filler, no messy detours. The pacing keeps you hooked as it builds mystery and suspense with precision. Add to that the incredible use of music - blues, gospel, jazz - which doesn't just set the tone but amplifies it. It blends beautifully with the era and atmosphere, creating something both eerie and soulful.It's stylish, thrilling, and haunting - Sinners delivers on all fronts."

          "content": "This film was nothing short of a masterpiece. Not only is this film one of the best vampire films I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best films I've ever seen in general.This film had a phenomenal cast, an exceptional score, and riveting story. I truly could not believe what I had witnessed after watching this beautiful piece of art.Michael B. Jordan was fantastic as Smoke/Stack. The fact he played two characters, which is double the effort, and still delivered a phenomenal performance through both of the characters is truly incredible. It really shows why he is such a terrific and talented actor.Jack O'Connell was outstanding as Remmick. He delivers one of the best villain performances I've ever seen. As an Irishman it makes me feel ecstatic that the main vampire and villain is Irish, and don't even talk to me about that Irish dance scene, I was in awe. What's even better is that Jack O'Connell's father was Irish, making him half Irish, which is incredible. The fact that Ryan Coogler has respect for Irish history, our hardships, and our music makes me incredibly proud to be Irish.Miles Caton was superb as Sammie Moore. The fact this role was his debut acting role is truly remarkable. His voice, guitar skills, and acting in general were all excellent. He is definitely going to go far, and I love the idea of him playing Miles Morales in the MCU.Hailee Steinfeld, Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson, and Wunmi Mosaku were all incredible as well, the whole cast was.You know a film is a masterpiece when you are in disbelief when the credits roll. Thank you Ryan Coogler, Ludwig Göransson, Autumn Durald Arkapaw, and the rest of the cast and crew for making this beautiful film.Overall, this film was absolutely amazing and incredibly enjoyable from beginning to end. Go and see this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably in IMAX. I'll definitely be seeing it again, maybe even two more times.\"You keep dancing with the devil... one day he's gonna follow you home.\"Jedidiah."

          "content": "I think the movie is very good. It's ambitious, with some thoughtful messages and metaphors. There is an overall grand and epic feel to the story. The plot kinda reflects \"From Dusk 'Till Dawn\" in the sense that the first half or so plays like a drama until the vampires come out of nowhere to switch the genre. Some might feel that the opening (i.e. The pre-vampire part) is slow, but I thought this portion allowed us to grasp the setting and the characters fully before the vampire portion kicks in and accelerates the pacing.Michael B. Jordan is fantastic in the double role as twin brothers Smoke and Stack. There's one scene where Smoke and Stack's cousin sings and plays the guitar: the scene becomes like a dream, with various black musicians' popping in and out (e.g. A turntablist, electronic guitarist, African drummers). The scene is impressive; it reminded me of something you'd see in a Spike Lee movieIn terms of flaws - Michael B Jordan's character Stack gets a romance with Hailee Steinfield, but the other brother Smoke gets a romance with an actress named Wunmi Mosaku, who isn't right for the role. Michael B Jordan is too far out of her league to be her boyfriend. Early, the characters find out that vampires can't enter a dwelling unless invited. The result is that the vampires just hang out and sing/dance outside the dwelling for most of the movie, which became a drag. The vampires are also not scary at all in this film. I don't wish to spoil, but there's one scene near the very end involving a gunfight - this scene feels oddly unsatisfying even when the victims deserve it; it just feels like the filmmakers merely wanted to get this one part in before the credits rolled."

It emphasises from dusk until dawn a little but the horror vibe is really not there, absolutely no 'scary' bits as it's portrayed, there is a heavy emphasis on blues music and the music is very soulful, but I feel it needed a bit more than just the opening credits to build into the 'gateway to demons' vibe it contains, it doesn't really get explored well, the lead vampire wants sammy because of this, but it's only mentioned once where it could of been more of a catalyst to the story.The thing that lost it a little for me is Jack O'Connell, he is a great actor, and plays his part well, but the Irish dancing, and the whole vampire vibe was so child like, it just didn't really fit in, it needed to be darker!The last thing, and I know it's to portray brotherly love and having each others back, but smoke not killing stack because of a promise not to kill sammy is just absurd, at that point they were under tutelage from the lead vampire and the direction was to kill all.Very good parts of the film, the vampires needed a lot more character building, the brothers could have had there own film just on what they have done themselves and it would have been great!It's worth watching but they hype for this film is incredibly high, and I don't believe it's better than Ryan's other work mainly black panther."

Based on the title alone, I brushed it off-didn't care to look it up, didn't watch a trailer, nothing. To be honest, it didn't spark any interest in me.Fast-forward a few days later, my husband surprised me with a spontaneous movie date. I walked into the theater knowing absolutely nothing. No expectations, no spoilers, not even a hint of the genre. And let me tell y'all-blown away. Completely, utterly, beautifully blown away.This movie was phenomenal. I mean that with my whole chest. I really freaking enjoyed it. So much so that I left the theater wanting to see it again. No, scratch that-needing to see it again. I want to see it a few more times because it was that good. One of those films where you just sit there like, \"Whoa...what did I just experience?\"The moment I stepped out, the first thing I did was call my mom. Of course, I didn't spoil a single thing-but I couldn't hold back how much I loved it. I told her she needs to go see it today. Her response? \"Man, I've been seeing it everywhere. Everybody's talking about how good it is.\" And it's true. You can feel the buzz. It's not just hype-it's earned admiration.I even had to call my friend right after, and she was like, \"You saw it? Oh my gosh, I've been wanting to see it too!\" Mind you-she doesn't even like horror. And she still wants to see it. That tells you something. The feedback on this film is magnetic. Even people who haven't seen it yet are excited just from hearing about it. That kind of energy? That speaks volumes.So yeah, this movie? A straight 100 out of 100 stars. No doubt. It took me by surprise, made me feel everything, and left me wanting more. If you're thinking about seeing it, stop thinking-just go. You won't regret it."

Even before the main adversary, the movie was action-packed and suspenseful. Not to mention the beautiful music and camerawork. I loved everything about the BTS of production. The costumes, set design, accents, etc. Were magnificent. I would 1000% recommend this film as well as a deep dive into the intricate euphemisms throughout the movie."

          "content": "Sinners is pure cinematic bliss; it's the kind of movie that reminds you why you fell in love with movies in the first place. This movie rules - an unforgettable, genre-bending, cinematic experience that demands to be seen in IMAX. Mesmerizing, intense, and electrifying, Ryan Coogler has outdone himself yet again. It's masterful work, entertaining and artistically transcendent; what a picture! This is a shot of adrenaline for original filmmaking. What begins as a deep Southern gangster period piece soon transforms into a harrowing fight for survival and spiritual freedom against a ruthless clan of vampires. And it's absolutely awesome. It oozes creativity and features almost everything we are begging for as moviegoers. Its originality shines, specifically within the quieter moments, but the loud genre tropes are played to perfection as Coogler injects a ridiculous amount of adrenaline into each bloodstained sequence.Don't complain to me about the state of Hollywood, don't lecture me about recycled IP, and don't talk to me about the future of show business if you aren't seeing Sinners in theatres. Sinners is further proof that Ryan Coogler is a generational director. I've wondered for years who will be the directors that I grow old with - who will be the names I see on a poster and immediately buy a ticket. After seeing Sinners, I think it's safe to say one of those directors is so clearly Ryan Coogler. Fruitvale Station, Creed, Black Panther, and now Sinners? At 38, he's delivering work that cements him as one of the true greats, representing a new era in cinema. This isn't just another entry in his filmography - Sinners is a gift to a generation starved for something original.With Sinners, Ryan Coogler delivers a visionary masterwork that cements his place among the greatest filmmakers of our time, alongside Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve in terms of scope, sound, and ambition. Coogler is firing on all cylinders - thematically, visually, and narratively, delivering an engrossing, moving, tragic, horrifying, devastating, thought-provoking, and extremely satisfying film. Seamlessly blending image and sound, he crafts a film that is both contained and intimate but also transcendent and huge, packed with bold genre swings-from vampiric dance-offs to tender meditations on death and spirituality. Coogler's authorship is unmistakable, his voice singular, and his ambition staggering. This isn't just a stylish horror flick-it's a layered, emotionally resonant, and thematically rich epic that feels like the fully realized expression of his voice as a director and his greatest film to date.And let me be clear: this thing rips. From the moment it starts, it's operating on its own rhythm - bluesy, bloody, and boldly spiritual. The first half is a slow burn, sure, but it's all intentional. Coogler cloaks you in the atmosphere of 1930s Mississippi, using every cinematic tool in the box to immerse us in a different time and place. While the film takes its time immersing us in its setting and introducing us to the characters, once Coogler sets the stage, the music and the blood flow with an otherworldly kind of energy that is wholly singular and unforgettable. All the technical elements from the cinematography to the production design to the music all are excellent but what really is impressive is how well they are all brought together to create such a unique final product that oozes with style. The end result is one that seamlessly integrates a smaller and more artistic feel with everything that makes a big-time blockbuster exciting. There is nothing quite like this movie; it truly felt like it brought a breath of fresh air to cinema.There is a sequence in the juke joint about halfway through that will genuinely levitate you from your seat, and will be hard to beat as the scene of the year. It's a breathtaking sequence involving music that is so transcendent and powerful and dripping with meaning that is completely communicated all through music and imagery. It's hypnotic and spellbinding; euphoric isn't even the right word to describe it. It's an insanely awesome piece of filmmaking and an absolute \"moment\" that works as the bridge to the second half of the film. I'd be surprised if any moment in film for the rest of the year can surpass how this one made me feel!Ludwig Göransson's score for Sinners is nothing short of extraordinary-bluesy, electrifying, and absolutely essential to the film's emotional and atmospheric power. It is as integral to the story as the shadowy IMAX visuals, weaving a soul-gripping musical tapestry that elevates the entire experience to something transcendent. Göransson is on a legendary run right now, consistently delivering radically different, yet flawless work that I feel so lucky to be alive to witness. If he keeps this up, he's well on his way to being remembered as one of the greatest film composers of all time.The performances in Sinners are stellar across the board, led by a phenomenal dual performance from Michael B. Jordan, who brings two distinct, deeply human characters to life with effortless cool and emotional precision. He's matched by a knockout ensemble, including a quietly powerful Hailee Steinfeld, a menacing and unhinged Jack O'Connell, and strong support from Delroy Lindo and Wunmi Mosaku. But the real revelation is newcomer Miles Caton, whose debut is nothing short of electrifying-this is a name we'll be hearing a lot more in the years to come.It reminded me a lot of Jordan Peele films because of how layered, deep, and rich the screenplay is - I love that you can revisit nearly any scene in the film and deconstruct the ideas, motifs, and symbols - it's very thought-provoking. The world, music, and atmosphere create such a compelling lead-up that actually surpasses the entire vampire element. The vampires end up being like the little bit of Parmesan topping a bowl of spaghetti-it's nice that it's there, but it's not crucial to enjoy the meal.Sinners is living proof that the biggest studios in the industry are still capable of creating artistic, provocative, and emotionally powerful stories. With Ryan Coogler's steady, brilliantly creative mind, an unforgettable score that's bound to rack up numerous awards, consistent performances, one of the most effective uses of IMAX, and an incredibly rich thematic approach to racial oppression, cultural identity and spirituality, it's no exaggeration to call this one of the most impactful films of the year so far. Intense, memorable entertainment with sharp social commentary. A bloody cinematic epic that had me in awe of the incredible filmmaking on display by Ryan Coogler, already a best of the year contender!"

In fact, Sinners turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.This film is a masterclass in storytelling, effortlessly weaving together multiple genres and layers of meaning. It's a thriller, but not the over-the-top kind-just the right amount of eerie and suspenseful to keep you on edge without overwhelming you. It ties in elements of history, folklore, and religion, creating a narrative that's rich, meaningful, and deeply engaging.And let's talk about those endings-three of them! Each one added a new layer, keeping the audience guessing all the way to the very, very, very end.The cinematography was nothing short of stunning. Every frame was thoughtful and intentional. You can truly tell that producer Ryan Coogler is not only dedicated to his craft, but deeply passionate about every aspect of it. The music score was equally powerful-perfectly timed, emotional, and memorable.Sinners is an absolute must-see. From the storytelling to the visuals to the sound, this film delivers on every level. A solid 10/10 across the board."

          "content": "After a wonderful horror renaissance we have been experiencing whether you partake in the genre or cant find something to whet your appetite. The film \"Sinners\", in short was a great vamp-ramp with intriguing lore to fresh out the foundation and set up what begins as what seems as a period piece. Then it sticks a stake in you, twisting and gnashing until the credits roll. Therefore creatively glistening so much that you can't look away in the best way possible (the blood does help...). It's refreshing to take a trip to the cinema and leave without feeling your intellect being called into question and not having that odd feeling your finger has been in someone else's belt loop for the past two hours like a theme park. Ryan Coogler getting a chance to step away from any Marvel franchise or the boxing ring just adds to his already versatile film-making flow. This makes any film lover excited to see a young director see this vision and capitalize on it so greatly."

From the opening scene, it pulls you in with a gripping blend of horror, action, and intense emotion that never lets up. Michael B. Jordan is phenomenal playing both twins, he brings a raw intensity and subtle contrast to each character that makes the story all the more compelling. Hailee Steinfeld also delivers an excellent performance as well.The entire cast stepped up, creating a tight, immersive world where every scene had weight. The mix of horror and action was perfectly executed, never too over the top, but always enough to keep you on edge. The direction, pacing, and atmosphere made it feel like something fresh and bold, not just another genre movie.It's rare to find a film that's this entertaining while also being so well-crafted. Sinners hits hard and stays with you, a must-watch."

And this not only was a good blockbuster, but one of the best of recent times!From the acting, to the casting, to Hailee's performance and to my favorite 2 things:\nThe story and the art in this movie's filming..\nEvery single scene was so beautiful. The scene of Miles Caton's singing will be remembered for ages for both his voice and how beautifully executed that scene was.But something else that stuck to me was how much nostalgia this movie brought, giving the vibes of Django Unchained, mixed with that last scene where Micheal B Jordan fired shots like he was rambo!The movie really gave everything from an enjoyable story that really took its time introducing to us who the characters, then building the vampire story after that as the movie went on (huge performance from Jack O'Connell too!) which lead to a really tense arc of survival between them and the vampires.Hopefully Ryan Coogler keeps blessing Hollywood with amazing moviesP. S Shameik Moore, take some notes on how to be Hailee's co-star lol."

          "content": "From beginning to end, I was completely hooked on this movie. Every scene kept me engaged, and I found myself fully immersed in the storyline. It's not every day that a film can captivate you from the very first moment and hold your attention all the way through, but this movie did just that-and more. I absolutely loved everything about it: the storytelling, the music, the atmosphere, and most importantly, the phenomenal acting. Michael B. Jordan was absolutely incredible in this film, delivering a performance that was both powerful and emotionally resonant. His portrayal of the twins was outstanding-he made each character feel distinct, real, and fully realized. It takes an immense amount of talent to pull off dual roles with such depth and conviction, and he did it seamlessly.What stood out the most to me was how the film managed to blend different genres so effectively. There was horror, comedy, drama, and even moments of raw intensity that made the viewing experience unforgettable. The horror elements were chilling and eerie, but they weren't overdone-they were just enough to keep you on edge. The comedic moments offered some much-needed relief and were smartly placed throughout the story without taking away from the serious themes. That balance between laughter and fear, hope and pain, is what made this movie so well-rounded and emotionally compelling.Beyond the entertainment factor, what truly made this film exceptional was its ability to highlight the very real and painful history of African Americans. The film didn't shy away from portraying the harsh realities and fears that Black people lived with during those times. The sense of oppression, the fight to survive, and the constant fear of being stripped of one's identity, rights, or even life-all of it was shown in a way that was raw, powerful, and deeply emotional. It reminded me that even in the midst of fiction, stories like these are rooted in truth. The characters' pain was palpable, and the film served as a stark reminder of the systemic injustice that shaped-and in many ways still shapes-the Black experience in America.I found myself emotionally overwhelmed at times, especially during the scenes that depicted the losses and the never-ending fight for freedom and dignity. There was an unwavering sadness that lingered throughout the movie, and it wasn't just because of what the characters went through-it was also the realization that for many African Americans, this wasn't just a story. It was a reflection of their ancestors' lives, their struggles, their fears, happiness and their truths. The film gave a voice to those stories and made sure they were heard, remembered, and felt.The music in the film added so much to the atmosphere. It wasn't just background noise-it was a character in itself. The soundtrack elevated every emotion, whether it was building suspense, expressing joy, or echoing sorrow. It helped create an immersive world that felt authentic and emotionally charged. Each song seemed to be chosen with purpose, complementing the narrative in a way that was both subtle and powerful.I can honestly say this is one of those movies I could watch over and over again and still find something new to appreciate each time. It's layered, it's meaningful, and it's beautifully done. The direction, cinematography, and especially the acting came together to create something truly special. Michael B. Jordan delivered a performance that I won't forget anytime soon.This movie was more than just entertainment-it was a statement, a lesson, and a tribute all wrapped into one. Great work to everyone involved in bringing this story to life. It left a lasting impression on me, and I know it will for many others too."

My only complaint is that the first 45 minutes felt like such a slow set-up that I found myself wondering where the plot was going-but in the end, the set-up was well worth it.Try not to judge this through the lens of a horror film, but rather as a commentary on the devastation of slavery, the reality of pursuing the American dream as a minority, and the overlooked influence of Black and African American contributions to music-with, of course, a bloody vampire element.The vampires in this movie have some typical Hollywood traits: they're bloodthirsty creatures of the night, vulnerable to garlic, holy water, and sunlight. But they're not just animalistic or full of rage. They seek freedom by fleeing a world that shuns them, and so they flock to the darkness. In a way, they're somehow freer than who they were before they became vampires: immortal, unshackled from systemic oppression-but at a terrible cost. One particularly fascinating detail is that these vampires are part of a hive mind, connected through shared memories and emotions. This could represent generational trauma and solidarity among marginalized groups.In my opinion, these vampires symbolize the phenomenon of gang formation. Many gangs in the U. S. didn't begin as violent or criminal organizations; they originated as expressions of solidarity, protection, and resistance-especially in communities that were excluded from institutional power, safety, and opportunity.This movie doesn't aim merely to terrify-it asks you to witness a story that countless people, both dead and alive, share."

Directed with fearless vision and carried by the most breathtaking performances of the year, this movie is nothing short of phenomenal.Michael B. Jordan is a force of nature in Sinners. His performance is electrifying - deep, raw, and hauntingly beautiful. He plays a man battling not just literal monsters, but the ones within himself, and you feel every layer of that struggle. There are actors who act - and then there's Michael B. Jordan, who transcends. He delivers one of his finest roles yet, proving (again) that he's in a league of his own.The cast around him!!! Omg. Flawless. Every character feels alive, necessary, and charged with purpose. From the blood-soaked sinners to the ones trying to find redemption in a world cursed by generational trauma and supernatural darkness, each performance leaves a mark.The story is wild - a gritty mix of vampire horror, emotional drama, romance, dark comedy, and Black history told through the lens of generational sin and salvation. It somehow weaves centuries of pain and power into a modern-day thriller that explores identity, love, guilt, and redemption. The symbolism? Insane. The pacing? Sharp. The visuals? Stunning. And the message? Hits you in the chest.What makes Sinners so special is its balance. It's terrifying, but not just because of the vamps. It's moving, but not melodramatic. It's romantic, but never cheesy. And it's funny in ways that sneak up on you. The moments of levity are so well-placed, they just make the dark parts feel darker.This isn't just a vampire movie. It's a statement. It's a sermon. It's a scream from the ancestors wrapped in fangs and fire.If you haven't watched Sinners, you're missing out on one of the most original, thought-provoking, and soul-stirring films of the decade.10/10. A modern classic. This one will stay with you."

The film all take place in one day/night and as darkness falls , evil arrives...The acting and cinematography are 1st class. The set pieces look elegant and classy and you really feel immersed in the period. The characters relationships/ dynamics are totally believable and well laid out.It was refreshing to see one of the protagonists love interests as a fairly large attractive woman, and not the usual stick insect. I don't think I've ever seen this before in a mainstream movie, but was good to see.The cousin (Miles Caton) was the star of the movie and I'm so surprised this is his first movie!? Wow. He was as good if not superior to Michael B Jordan.My only criticism was the with the main villan played by English actor Jack O' Connell. You never get a sense of what he was after and where he came from. Also some parts could've been trimmed down a bit to make the runtime closer to 2hrs.This is the 5th time director Ryan Coogler has teamed up with Michael B Jordan, but SINNERS is their best movie to date.8 out of 10."

The editing and the musical score act like one entity in the film, full of Baz Luhrman-esque montages where often multiple scenes take place at once. At first the editing style was a little jarring to me, but I started to vibe with it by the second act of the film.There are times the film feels rushed, and considering the 2 and a half hour runtime, it made me wonder if a lot wound up on the cutting room floor so that they could get it within a reasonable runtime. Nonetheless, the film sped by.I suppose I was hoping for a little more lore to the supernatural aspects of film, rather than being treated as a convenience for the story, and I expected little more originality, since the advertising kept the film vague so I was wondering what the big \"secret\" was going to be that the trailers were keeping. Well, there was no big secret. This is essentially From Dusk Til Dawn: The Musical. But I didn't mind too much. It's still a wildly entertaining feature worth the watch, especially for the musical sequences.I think if you go in expecting entertainment rather than depth, you'll be satisfied. I'd watch it again; it's a good popcorn flick."

They gather people looking for a night of drinking and blues music in an abandoned barn. Uninvited guests-literally-lurk around, waiting to be let in. The three vampires are cooler than 99% of indie rock bands out there. They play outside, since they're uninvited.It takes 1 hour and 15 minutes before the vampires and blood show up. Then, it's one hour of survival. The Thing did this in 1986, Dog Soldiers did it with werewolves, and many others followed.What's enjoyable about this film is how it captures the flavor of the era-probably the 1920s. Plus, the music is great.Sinners is a pretty good film; definitely worth watching."

          "content": "In my personal opinion I loved this movie, it was an extraordinary experience. It felt a little bit slow but when the night arrived a knot got in my stomach and didn't go away until the credits appeared, I was ecstatic on every moment. Michael B. Jordan and Michael A. Jordan were fantastic in the role, but Miles Caton stoled the movie with his musical moment.With all of this in mind, I got surprised whenmy companions (A 23 y/o male, two 20 y/o girls and a 30 y/o woman) told me they doesn´t liked the film as much as I did. They told me that it took forever, that they didn't understand anything and that it was one of the strangest movies they had ever seen.I must admit that I saw a small review without spoilers of what the movie was about and maybe that's why I started looking for certain references to racism and the pacts that the story tries to capture. But honestly it still wasn't a movie I fully understood (But I didn't want to either).In conclusion I have to say that the movie is too enjoyable, maybe having a little more context, because the movie is not at all what you expect, it is not a typical vampire thriller, it is something else that takes its time to come out with an emotionally charged ending."

It's shocking, unforgettable, and will be talked about long after the credits roll. They've made a film like no other, that looks like no other, and sounds like no other. Every frame is packed with detail, every song laced with meaning. It's bold, bizarre, and brilliant.This is a true theatrical experience-one to be relished on the biggest screen, with the loudest sound, and the most unsuspecting audience."

          "content": "I'd have to see Sinners a second time to fully appreciate it, I'm sure, because I went into the theater expecting a horror film. It isn't. Instead, it's more of an exhilarating romp made for the love of music. Blues, especially (which I was enamored by), but that may have only been grounded by the setting. You also get get some wonderful samplings of bluegrass and Irish folk, as well as the grab bag of styles intermingling in that one scene. You know the one I'm talking about.The horror part? More of a glazing to give it narrative substance. Which I'm frankly disappointed by, because the pieces were in place to make something truly creepy. Instead, every opportunity was taken to rip away any commitment to the horror genre. Mysterious introduction to the main antagonist? Nope, they're revealed as casually as could be. Let the monologues describing period-specific horror steep in silence? Nope, wash it down with some background music and foley art. Long, drawn-out scenes that keep you waiting for the payoff? Nah, sudden edits and instant gratification.For a certain, Sinners is not a horror film, it simply has horror trappings and uses them for messaging about fellowship and covert persecution (the period drama aspect covered the overt persecution quite plainly, with some gratifying wish fulfillment at the end). Which, again, bummed me out a bit since it could have been more impactful. But I still left my seat largely satisfied in what I did watch. For all the weird edits, rushed scenes, and tacky callbacks (please, filmmakers, go back to treating your audience like they have half a brain and can remember what they've seen in the last hour or so...) - Sinners is cool movie with a great soundtrack, and you should watch it if you haven't already."

There were lots of jump scares. The blending of historical racism and Jim crow was a different spin on a horror film. It also gave me vibes from Django Unchained and The Jazzman Blues.If you never seen from Dusk to Dawn it will be fresh and new. However, if you saw From Dusk to Dawn it will feel familiar."

          "content": "Sinners is like From Dusk Till Dawn meets Django Unchained.The ending ties everything together and completely changes how you view the movie. You realize the vampires are still themselves as people, except they have seen something that others haven't, kind of like a drug user who had an amazing experience, and now wants to share it with you, and everyone else! After becoming vampires, they learned of eternal life in the darkness - and it feels amazing to them, and they want to share it (they just wanna cuddle in the darkness, aww... how cute!). In this way, they're almost friendly; they don't want to hurt you, per se, but only give you a love bite so that you can join them and have fun in the darkness! What an amazing interpretion of vampirism!!! I love it, and it sets up an amazing possibility for future franchises in this universe.The only criticism I can offer is the logic of the scene that shows Stack getting behind the main vampire and stabbing him in the back. That scene had me going like, wait a minute, that doesn't make that much sense. However, later, when you realize that he made a deal with his vampire brother, it does make sense that the other vampires agreed to let him through and protect the guy with the guitar from the main vampire, given that the brothers had agreed to spare the life of the guy with the guitar. Overall, the ending lets you put the puzzle pieces together which is one of the greatest things a film can do (the afterthought and realization of how it all makes sense, David Lynch style).And another small flaw, just to be as critical as possible in this review, is the scene near the end in which the brother shot up a bunch of Klan members, like in Django Unchained. It seemed a little out of place, and kind of like a spectacle, but it was still enjoyable. Even though it contributed somewhat to the story, it still felt a little bit out of place. But I still loved it! Who doesn't love revenge? Very Tarantino-esque.Besides that, it had one of the best music experiences I've ever seen. I loved the music scene of mixing of various black musicians from all times (future and past), and I got chills watching that scene!An 8/10, a banger!"

The story focuses on the blues, its roots in the South, and how music can transcend space and time. The addition of vampire lore and Southern spirituality makes the story more captivating.

The viewer wants more - more story, more sound, more imagery. How many different directions can this tale go? How deep? How far back? How far foward? How wide? What if each character told their part of the story with their cultural framing?The title itself is provocative, but almost every scene in the movie is something we've seen numerous times already. It's a lovely patchwork tapestry of the darkside of Americana. In retrospect, it comes across as very formulatic, with levels of fusion throughout. Setting - deep south. Main characters - gangsters. Plot - house party. Tension - hungry vampires. All of these independently are favorite movie genres. Can't go too wrong really."

Fast, slick, sharp - like a jazz solo that cuts through silence.This film doesn't hold your hand. You gotta lean in, feel the room, and ride the rhythm. There's a message under the madness - about legacy, temptation, and the price of stepping outside the lines.Now, the vampire thing? I won't lie - felt like a stretch. Stylish, sure, but I wasn't sold on the metaphor. Still, the film carries itself with so much black flavor and focus that you forgive the weird. One-takes were clean, the sound was spiritual, and the whole thing hums like an old jukebox with a soul of its own.Sinners doesn't preach - it performs.

It shows a lot, yet reveals nothing. I'd still prefer that one doesn't watch the trailers, especially the 2nd one before watching the film. You'll enjoy the film even more if you don't.Now, coming to the film. What a beauty! The performances and screenplay are absolutely on point. Michael B. Jordan delivers a career-high performance in his double role as twin brothers Smoke and Stack. Miles Caton as Sammie, the blues guitarist, steals every scene he's in with a soulful, electric presence. Everyone else is great in their roles too.The film pulls you into its universe, and you become completely immersed. It builds up gradually, with the first hour unfolding as a deliberate, blues-infused drama that just carefully sets up its characters and the theme. Once it hits its stride and the horror kicks in, there is no looking back.Around the halfway mark, you begin to understand what's really happening. And once the plot unfolds, you are taken on a blend of intrigue, thrill, anxiety, and (some) humour. You just can't take your eyes off the screen. It's epic!The music too does not just accompany the story, it elevates it and becomes a part of its soul. There's one jaw-dropping sequence, and it is pure movie magic, bridging past and future through music in probably one of the best cinematic moments ever witnessed in a film.For me, Sinners for sure is the best film of 2025 so far. I just loved everything about it. It starts slow but steadily begins to surprise and amaze. Every next 10 minutes feels better than the last, and it just keeps going higher from there.It has all the flavours of a cult classic, one that would be talked about for years to come."

Touted as a chilling horror flick with deep themes and intense scares, the reality is quite different-and not in a good way. This movie was, in a word, terrible. It's hard to understand the hype, because from start to finish, Sinners feels like a bizarre mishmash of genres, tones, and missed opportunities.Let's start with the one positive note: the beginning. For a brief moment, Sinners promises something decent. The film opens with a strong setup-moody lighting, eerie atmosphere, and characters who seem to be hiding dark secrets. It pulls you in with the expectation of psychological tension or supernatural horror. But as soon as the vampires show up, everything goes off the rails.And yes, there are vampires. Not the brooding, menacing type either-these are flamboyant, musical, tap-dancing vampires. I wish I were kidding. At one point in the film, the so-called terrifying creatures break out into a full-blown blues number. It's so out of place it's almost funny-until you remember you're watching what's supposed to be a horror movie. This bizarre tonal shift completely derails any suspense the film was trying to build. One minute you're watching a character be stalked in the shadows, the next you're watching vampires sing about heartbreak and loneliness under a disco ball. It's like Rocky Horror without the self-awareness.The scariest part of the movie? A snake jumping out of nowhere. That's it. That's the most tense moment in an entire film marketed as a supernatural horror experience. Everything else feels like camp-unintended camp at that. The gore is minimal, the suspense is lacking, and the attempts at jump scares are so poorly timed they either fall flat or make you laugh.Worse still is the way the story unravels. As mentioned earlier, the setup was intriguing, but as the movie leans more and more into its vampire twist, logic takes a back seat. Characters make baffling decisions, timelines get messy, and the mythology becomes too convoluted to care about. It almost feels like two separate movies smashed together-a gritty thriller and a vampire musical-with neither one fully fleshed out.The acting doesn't help. While some of the cast do their best with the script they're given, most performances feel phoned-in or awkward. The leads never fully sell the fear or urgency of their situations, and when the musical segments start, the whole thing becomes even more absurd. You can tell the actors weren't sure if they were supposed to be serious or campy, and that uncertainty bleeds into the tone of the entire film.Ultimately, Sinners is a confusing mess that doesn't know what it wants to be. If you're into vampire musicals-yes, that's apparently a genre now-then maybe this will be your thing. But if you came looking for a scary movie with chilling moments and a coherent plot, you're going to be sorely disappointed.It's one of those rare films where you walk away wondering if it was all some kind of elaborate joke. Between the musical numbers, the laughable vampires, and the totally wasted horror potential, Sinners ends up being more of a comedy of errors than anything else.Final verdict: Skip this one unless you're curious about how weirdly off-the-mark a horror movie can be. If you're looking for a genuinely scary experience, this film will leave you wondering what you just watched-and not in a good way."

However I walked out of the movie feeling very confused about what the point was. Is this a drama? Is it a gangster movie? Coming of age? Inspirational ? Musical? Comedy? Action? Thriller? Was this supposed to be symbolic? I would have preferred if they went in any of these directions more clearly and directly. I think if they focused more on the storyline about the twins, the young cousin, the music venue and the music in general it would have been an incredible movie. They definitely could have also tied in the elements of \"evil\" in a more subtle or realistic way that didn't feel so \"mish-mashy\" . Throwing the vampires in made this a little muddy. I liked so much of this movie but was also so confused about what I was supposed to be feeling or waking away with....:I still don't know ??"

The plot revolves around an age-old vampire cult and a mysterious prophecy, but it never truly develops into anything gripping or coherent. The atmosphere is completely lacking in suspense or tension. It's the kind of movie that makes you check your watch every 10 minutes. Definitely not worth the hours it demands.

The script manages to tell a story that talks about African-American culture in 1932 and how little has changed since then regarding racism, in addition to giving us a good number of blues songs and beautifully choreographed dance scenes. The performances are wonderful, highlighting the protagonist Michael B. Jordan as the twins Smoke and Stack, each masterfully played by Jordan, in addition to wonderful performances by Wunmi Mosaku, Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, Jack O'Connell, Jayme Lawson, Li Jun Li, and Yao. The production design is masterful, the cinematography is a visual delight, and the special makeup and gore effects are incredibly old-school. Plus, the scenes that pay homage to classics like the miniseries \"Salem's Lot\" and the film \"From Dusk till Dawn\" are welcome. Ryan Coogler's directorial work is among the finest in horror film history. \"Sinners\" is a soulful masterpiece."

Which I went to see because of the remarkable 8.2/10 rating, which, (in my opinion) is totally undeserved.I've given it 5/10, and that 5 , is only for about 45 minutes of the film.Whats good:-Sinners is beautifully filmed\nThe acting is very good\nThe part where the vampires attack the old saw mill, was easily the best part.I liked the fact the trailer didn't actually reveal it's about vampires.What's not good .The film is over long and the story wanders about into 'and then' things, with no relevance.There's no point spending a lot of time building up characters, or character history, that doesn't have any relevance or effect on the outcome or the story.When the film started I settled down expectantly, as it looked to be a well made film.After about 40 minutes of being bored, I wondered when something would happen.Another film where the writer is also the director (directors don't seem to make good writers).The writer didn't seem to know what genre he's writing for . Is it a horror, is it a gangster, is it a social history of racism, music, or a love story?, it jumps about all over the place.There was a bizarre part where an electric guitarist and other strange musicians appeared. I get that it was to show that 'Preacher Boy's' music opened a door way into the supernatural, but, (to me) it just seemed absurd.The writer's clearly copied/been influenced by, From Dusk till Dawn. There's hints of Twilight and Salem's Lot.Sinners is yet another film, that is heavy in imitation and light on originality.Would I watch the 2hr 17mins of Sinners again? Absolutely not.Astounded by the 8.2/10 and I can only presume this is bots or paid reviews of some description. I'm certainly more sceptical on reviews of newer films stating 'best film ever' etc."

          "content": "Sinners was my most anticipated films of 2025, given that it was a period piece, as well as a supernatural horror. Both genres that I genuinely love to see on film. Needless to say, this film delivers, and I was happy to have seen it in theaters.To start off on a positive note, Ryan Coogler's direction, as well as the 1932 Mississippi Delta, backdrop of this film was incredible. From the costumes, to the cinematography, and the overall setting made me feel really engulfed in this world.The film centers around twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, both of whom are played outstandingly by Michael B Jordan. I truly believe this is perhaps one of his best performances of his entire filmography thus far. Probably not exceptional enough to win an Oscar, but I think it's worthy of a nomination, at least.The other outstanding performance in this is Jack O'Connell, who plays the mysterious vampire, Remmick. He is both charming, scary, and conniving all at the same time, and whenever he is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off of him. I would be remiss not to mention Hailee Steinfeld as well, but her role isn't as substantial despite the trailers.However, I need to get into the things that really prevented this film from being great. The supernatural element does not interject into the plot until at least 50 mins to an hour into the film, which is the halfway point. This may not be an issue for most people, but because the vampires are such a significant part of the film, their introductions feel very rushed, especially when we get to the climax.This is not a spoiler, but the film takes place over the course of an entire day, so, even though we get to know a lot of the characters, we don't get to know a lot about Remmick's motivations, who he is, and why he is attracted to one person in particular despite Jack O'Connell's great acting. There are some moments in this film that feel incredibly weird and out of place, in particular, there are at least 3 sex scenes in the film (with the exception of the last one) that are there for no reason other than Ryan Coogler just wanting to make the audience feel awkward and uncomfortable.The action really isn't all that good when you get right down to it, as you've seen it done better many times before, especially in the horror genre. I usually hate when there is social and political messaging in films, but given that this film is set in the Jim Crow South, there are some plots involving racism, which is understandable. However, it doesn't seem to blend into the story later on as it did in the first half, especially when vampires are introduced into the mix.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely watch it again when it's on demand, but I wouldn't rush back into the theaters to see it. I know Ryan Coogler is a fantastic Director, but he really needs better writers to collaborate on the scripts that he writes. This film has so much potential, and it could have been more had the story been improved."

One thing that I love about this film is that It is a Southern Gothic film that takes place in the Deep South of the Country; the film depicts Black music of the Roaring 20s and the contemporary music of the 21st Century, Michael B.

Still working with actor Michael B. Jordan, this is the story of Smoke and Stack (both played by Jordan), twins who come back home to Mississippi from making it big in Chicago. Side note: It always blows my mind how they're able to film one actor interacting with himself as twins. It's just wild. It's 1932, not the most ideal time for Black people in America. Smoke is the more grounded of the two, while Stack is more of a wildcard. Both have love interests who they reconnect with, Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) and Annie (Wunmi Mosaku). They come back to town to open up a juke joint, a place to be themselves and feel free from the oppressive society they're engulfed in. An amazing ensemble cast is gathered, including actor Miles Caton. He is the heart and soul of this film. I can't believe this is his first acting gig! Dude has a bright future ahead of him. There's an aspect to this movie that I don't want to tell you about, even though the second trailer already has (don't watch it!). I'm going to expertly dance around it from here on out. If I do get close to saying something, the codeword is \"pineapple\". So, this movie has \"pineapples\" in it. The marketing team have focused on this aspect because it simply gets people in the theater seats. But little do they know, this movie is so much more than just \"pineapples\". The smart script has so many different layers of commentary that come together in a cohesive way. The first half of the film is a slow burn, but it successfully establishes a sense of community and genuine friendships that make the world feel lived in. I sufficiently cared about the characters by the time things got crazy. I can't go on until I talk about the music. This has a banger of a score from composer Ludwig Göransson, blending genres and different cultures, transcending space and time. This movie has everything: It's a period piece, thriller, horror, crime drama, comedy, and even some surprisingly sexy scenes. This is the kind of big swing that famous directors should be making. It's had the biggest box office weekend for an original movie since 2017's GET OUT. Hollywood should take notes. Great visuals, I highly recommend a visit to your local theater! Oh, when the movie's over, don't move! There's a bunch more during and after the credits! Go support original movies so Hollywood can make more of them. Remember, if you keep dancing with the Devil, one day he's gonna follow you home."

The way the film embraces all the familiar tropes of the genre - and then flips them on their head.After an era of constant reinvention, rule-breaking, and attempts to be \"different,\" someone finally dares to go back to what works - and does it so well, it feels completely fresh.As someone who didn't grow up in the U.

Two twin siblings come back from Chicago envisioning a sanctuary, a quaint pub away from the clamor of disdain and injustice. What awaited them was not human, but something much more ominous and malevolent than racism.The venue was alive with music and dancing to an overwhelming extent, taking over the rhythm of the heart, However, it didn't comfort you, it reminded you that at times, hell can be beautiful enough to enter with a grin!Two twin siblings return from Chicago dreaming of a sanctuary, a warm tavern distant from the noise of contempt and inequality. Nevertheless, what they faced was not of human creation, but rather something far more wicked and threatening than racism.In this instance, the bar wasn't a bar, it was a trap.Initially, at night, three wan faces, partly human, partly foreboding.Laughter turns into screams, dancing morphs into a slaughter, and brotherhood is fractured not by treachery, but by a malevolent moment.Evil does not originate from the human heart, but instead arises from a contagion that evolves into a force that strips away your humanity, replacing it with a ravenous indifference that can only be appeased by blood.The Sinners portrays evil not as an outside adversary, but as a contagion that takes over an individual, changing them into a merciless and unrepentant entity. Genuine horror does not reside in hatred but in the loss of emotions, compassion, and everything that defines your humanity.In the end, it's a movie centered on an involuntary sin, depicting individuals struggling to maintain their identity as those around them devolve into beings for whom existence holds no significance.Let's highlight a few of the advantages, the first being:Michael B. Jordan in this amazing twofold role.One minute you despise him for his harshness, the next you adore him for his brightness.Amid this conflict, he neither falls nor shatters. Instead, he demonstrates that acting is not a facade, but an inner eruption, and that art, at moments, can be nearer to insanity than logic.He does not perform two roles. He pulls you into accepting the unimaginable in the realm of art.Another advantageous element is director Ryan Coogler's remarkable equilibrium between horror and humor. Typically, these two genres consume one another, yet in this case, both astound you.The terror was intense and oppressive, but within the gloom, it still brought laughter without disrupting the atmosphere.The skilled actor Delroy Lindo, portraying \"Delta Slim\", served as the cornerstone of this beneficial element. It was a lively, clever, and tumultuous comedy, to the extent that you hope for a full-length sitcom situated in the same period, featuring the same eccentric character who merges insanity, insight, and humor amid the disorder.Regarding the downsides, I prefer not to be too critical, as the movie was genuinely outstanding. Nevertheless, the convergence of the notion of ultimate vengeance between Black Americans and whites somewhat tarnished the concept of external malevolence, which was foundational to the film, as if it were merely an emotional moment, emphasizing the persistence of themes of oppression and advocacy for human rights defenders."

Coogler brings something spectacular in the vampire genre, that only he can do. Review:\nCannot holded cannot holded the story, dialogue n music re synchronized it just exploded of pure entertainment, by writing the southern accent in more party house, but is the soundtrack that takes the cake of whole movie. From the way the vampires get their praises up, to the dynamite harmonics introducing to Slim. The movie doesn't stop until dawn.Michael B Jordan plays twins as charismatic Stuck n hothead Smoke but is Stuck that impressive a lot when he outer r promoting the grand opening of their club but also the harsh relationship with Mary.Miles Caton plays the son preacher Sami takes it with some mean guitar sounds been( for me) the heart of the movie, making he's debut.Veteran actor Delroy Lindo has the funny moments of the film, meaning he's introduction as Delta Slim was best moment of whole film, the dialogue of the beer, perfection.Spoilers end credits was awesome by Buddy Guy n Michael B Jordan remminence of that faithful night was phenomenal on how both cherish songs to the last dawn.So conclude there's is no telling what else this power team can bring, cause they already make something Crackaboom with music dashed with horror, cause even one man army against the klan reminds in the south the vampires weren't danger thing that night."

          "content": "After watching \"Sinners\" for over 2 slow burn hours that dragged on like weeks I felt like I'd just seen a poor mans version of one of my fave directors Robert Rodriguez's projects \"From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).After doing a deep dive I discover that particular vampire cult movie is one of African American Director Ryan Cooglers biggest influences on \"Sinners\".The setup is very similar with a bunch of people at the grand opening of a \"Juke Joint\" bunkered down for the night whilst vampires gather in numbers outside this slaughterhouse of booze, blues and depravity.Honestly give me the blues any day over the Irish Michael Flatley style jigs and sea shanty's being danced around and sung by the unwelcome creatures of the night outside the joint.There are scenes like that which made me think I was at the screening of a comedy/parody horror film and when the vampires jump it looked comical.\"Sinners\" is billed as a supernatural horror flick, but there wasn't one jump scare, nothing threatening or even vaguely terrifying about the movie.Don't even start me on the not so scary, superfluous narrator.Coogler is an acclaimed director with the \"Black Panther\" franchise for Marvel, plus \"Creed\".The only good thing to come out of the latter into this film was Michael B. Jordan skilfully and believably playing the twin gangsters \"Smoke\" and \"Stack\".Why an actor of his calibre signed onto this I don't understand.He's not the only draw card on the marquee.Delroy Lindo, Hailee Steinfeld, Wunmi Mosaku and others also contribute greatly, but the script didn't help them at all.\"Sinners\" is a very stylish horror movie that spends way too much time in the set up as Coogler tries to flesh out his characters.In fact, the movie makes the mistake of using style over substance in frame after frame.Time that could have been better spent amping up the horror...just a thought!Watch out for: Legendary composer, guitarist, singer Buddy Guy in the final scene.A scene that only added to the filler and no thriller of the humourless \"Sinners\".On a positive note the 1920's sets, cars, costumes, props etc are all first class.The musical performances by the people of colour are incredible and help save \"Sinners\".It's the glue to this movie and largely thanks to Miles Caton as \"Sammie\" playing a beautiful guitar that's a real weapon...a head banger!Clearly the story has political implications and peels back layers of generational racism of the era (including the Klu Klux Klan) in an effort to try and make the movie a seemingly superior horror film.All that does, however, is water down the real horror of how African Americans were treated so poorly.This is no \"Django\" no matter how hard it tries.Unfortunately like so many other releases in 2025 the movie trailer was way better than what followed.Oddly enough the working title for \"Sinners\" was \"Grilled Cheese\" even though it's not a cheesy movie it did feel over cooked."

          "content": "Perched atop my van beneath the twinkling stars of the Raleigh Road Drive-In, I fell into Sinners like I was prepared to live there. Cinema does that. It casts its spell not just on the screen, but across your memory-rekindling fragments of other pictures like stories from a past life. And while Sinners takes place long before the advent of the drive-in, there was something soul-enriching about watching it at such a cinematically vintage venue. If not a movie palace, then a parking lot cathedral.With its dusty palette, timeless setting, and mythic tone, I felt like I'd entered a cinematic universe I already knew. It reminded me of the way Life (1999) pairs tragedy with resilience, how O Brother, Where Art Thou? Filters the South through music and myth. Stories that stretch backward through time while remaining rooted in the now. Stories where rhythm is memory, and memory is survival.This is a film woven from many threads-vampires, music, history, religion. And like a snake coiled around a branch, those threads constrict the story with tension, but never suffocate it. Every character has a place. Every voice carries. Every location hums with reason.At a glance, it plays like a Peelian horror-a genre piece that reflects the Black American experience through the lens of monstrosity and myth. But when I looked deeper, I saw something else: a love letter to music, and a pointed reflection on the predatory nature of the industry that profits from it.The entertainment industry promises you everlasting life. But what it really wants is your soul.This isn't just a story about horror-it's about how the machine takes and takes until there's nothing left but the echo of your voice. Ryan Coogler doesn't just feature music in his picture-he reveres it. From bluegrass to gospel, country to blues, Sinners honors the full spectrum of Southern sound. A sound that is rooted in two centric elements: soul and story.Two things that this film is riddled with.Sadly, this picture reminds us that talent is a dinner bell. Like the vampire drawn to the sound of Sammie's song, he is driven with hunger and destruction. Like a disease-ridden mosquito sensing blood through skin, the industry pierces your defenses and feeds on what's pure, leaving you with nothing but infection and death.The Irish vampire says it best while our protagonist is reciting the Lord's Prayer, \"...the men who colonized my people said this same thing to us.\"Like truth through teeth, it reminds you that colonization wasn't reserved for one skin tone. And it wasn't just physical-it was spiritual, cultural, and deathly melodic. We are reminded that the thieves still prosper today as the upperclass pillages folk culture and redistributes our pain as their product.These points are made abundantly clear in one of the film's most striking moments: a musical number that moves like a ghost through generations of Black music, showing us the evolution of soul under oppression. It reminds you that you can steal from a culture, but you'll never outrun its evolution.Even the brief appearance of the Choctaw vampire hunters feels intentional. Fitting, really-considering Native American artist Link Wray created Rumble, the foundational riff that birthed rock and roll, only to have the genre commandeered by American-born Europeans decades later. A point that is further drilled in as the score slowly begins to take on a rock and groove metal undertone towards the final act.Not all is grim. Something worth noting is like the vampires in this picture, true music will last forever. And while history often favors the thief-the chart-topper, the mansion-dweller, the well-dressed archivist-one thing is certain:You can't take the soul out of the music, when the music is the soul of the people."

Credit where it's due; every performer, double dose Michael B. Jordan included, sells their lines like rent's due tomorrow, and the needle drops plus smoky jazz score nail the late '90s neo noir vibe so hard you can almost smell the clove cigarettes.

The film takes place in the early 30s in Mississippi, obviously a difficult time for our friends of color. Racism is certainly an allegory that drives some of the narrative, but not solely. This is a film about family, community, the power of music. The story is beautiful at times, only to be outmatched by its cinematography. The first act is primarily a period piece with strong world building and character development. To say these people feel lived in is an understatement. Incredible performances all around, especially from Michael B. Jordan, and newcomer Miles Caton. Miles was built for this. Ryan Coogler has such incredible vision and faith in his craft. There's a scene in particular towards the middle of the film, I was thinking what a tremendous mistake by Ryan. I was moved beyond belief. What a mighty swing that he connected with completely. This film's a drama, with light thriller elements and a nice Taste of horror, though it's slow to get there, which I didn't mind at all. This movie feels completely its own. It has somewhat of a similar feel to Lovecraft Country. I was thinking about this movie all night after I finished it, and my wife mentioned to me that she was thinking about it all morning. The following day. Can't recommend it enough. Ryan Coogler you bad bad man!"

          "content": "I went into Sinners expecting a horror/vampire movie set in the South of the US, but ended up with something else entirely. It's really more of a slow-burning blues/music drama... that occasionally remembers it also has vampires.To be honest, I expected a lot more from this film. After reading so many glowing reviews calling it \"amazing\" and \"unlike anything else,\" I was ready for something bold and genre-defying. What I got instead was a meandering, tonally confused film that doesn't seem to know what story it's trying to tell.The tone is all over the place. One minute you're watching a smoky, Southern dive-bar jam session; the next, a pale-faced vampire is awkwardly thrown into the scene like someone wandered in from another film set. It's clear the filmmakers are passionate about the music, and to be fair, the blues performances are soulful and well done, but that's pretty much the only thing holding this thing together.Pacing is a major issue. Sinners feels way too long, dragging its heels between moments of actual plot development. And when it does seem like it might build toward something climactic, it just... doesn't. It fizzles. There's no real payoff, and the movie has no idea where or how to end. The final act is a slow crawl to a non-conclusion that left me wondering why the vampire angle was even included in the first place.To make matters worse, the film is padded with way too many sex scenes that add absolutely nothing to the story. They're neither meaningful nor character-building, just more filler in an already directionless film. It feels like they were thrown in for style points, not storytelling.If you're here for horror or vampires, prepare to be disappointed. If you're deeply into blues and don't mind a wandering story with a few random fangs thrown in, maybe this will land better for you. But for me, it was a confused, overlong, and ultimately hollow experience that didn't deliver what it promised."

The rest of the movie takes you frim tension to calm several times, and while there's a clear \"climax\", some scenes after that try to get you there once again when there's no real need.Regarding the tone... not sure if this works as a horror movie, an action movie or period drama. The film takes us through each of those styles but never builds an engaging atmosphere whatsoever.Also, I think the plot was clever but the execution of the \"vampires\" was underwhelming. Same old vampire tropes we've seen millions of times, but this time with a \"folky\"vibe which doesn't let you love or hate the villains. No emotional engagement here, which is needed for a successful story. There is no real myth to which we can stick to in order to make those vampires plausible.All in all this is a very enjoyable feature."

This genre-breaking film feels one-of-a-kind in its storytelling, pulling inspiration from classic vampire films while reimagining the genre in bold, refreshing ways. It manages to honor the timeless monster while breathing new life into it-no easy feat.That said, Sinners isn't without its flaws. The opening act moves at a slow pace, and while that deliberate buildup is necessary to establish the world, it can feel like a bit of a slog. By the halfway point, I found myself thinking, \"Okay, this is dragging a bit.\" But just as it starts to overstay its welcome, the film hits back with some truly satisfying action sequencesOne area I wish had been fleshed out more was the backstory of Smoke and Stack, twins both portrayed by Michael B. Jordan in what could very well be an Oscar-worthy double performance. While we don't get much direct exposition about who they are or where they come from, the film offers just enough through subtle hints and visual storytelling to let us piece together their past. Despite the mystery, it's easy to become completely invested in both characters. It's a testament to the writing and acting that they remain two of the film's most compelling figures.Sinners delivers a standout ensemble performance, a riveting narrative that grips you to the end, a stellar soundtrack, and a satisfying finale (and yes, stick around after the credits). This film is a must-see-and it might just carve out a place as a modern classic."

The movie so subtly but powerfully touched on issues like racism, colonization (of ireland too), religion. Vampire element just made the movie downright enjoyable. And the music !! Amazing.Jack o,connell is amazing as always. Really enjoyed listening to the music from the vampires side and then miles canton lit up the screen when he performed. Even michael b jordon surprised me with his performance as the twins. Definitely one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. Hats off to ryan coogler."

(And a few jump scares). The story is great, but the music carries it even further. It has deeper meanings and symbolism woven in throughout that keep you thinking after you leave the theater. Even though it was on the longer side, it kept you interested throughout almost every minute. The acting was also really good by the entire cast. I don't normally find Michael B Jordan's acting really notable, but he really excelled in this role. It's really hard to play twins, but he did so very well and believably. I also love when he plays an evil character. The actor who played the Preacher Boy also really did amazing. He had a strong unique singing voice and really kept up well with the other actors for his first role. Delroy Lindo has always been a phenomenal actor and did very well with his role adding that comedic relief. Remmick, Annie, Pearline, Cornbread and the rest of the supporting cast did amazing as well. I definitely recommend going to see this movie in theaters!"

          "content": "*Sinners*, the newly released horror film, makes a bold statement with its unique blend of historical drama and supernatural terror. Featuring a talented cast led by Michael B. Jordan and Hailee Steinfeld, the film offers a fresh take on the genre, set in the early 19th century during the era of slavery.The film follows two Afro-American brothers who, after coming across a large sum of money, plan to invest it and build a community. What begins as a simple, almost hopeful story takes a sudden turn halfway through, much like the unexpected shifts seen in genre-defining works like Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho* and the cult classic *From Dusk Till Dawn*. This switch in tone shifts the narrative from a tale of survival and ambition to a deeper, darker exploration of the supernatural, and while this pivot is effective, it may be predictable for seasoned horror fans.*Sinners* is, overall, an entertaining experience. The performances of the cast are a highlight. Michael B. Jordan brings depth to the role of Smoke, while Hailee Steinfeld's portrayal of Mary injects an emotional complexity to the story. The quirky characters and their relationships give the film a sense of unpredictability, preventing it from becoming one-dimensional.However, it is worth noting that the film's twists and reveals can be spoiled easily, particularly with the abundance of spoilers circulating on platforms like YouTube. It's unfortunate, as the film's later plot developments are integral to the overall experience. That said, even if you can anticipate the twist, *Sinners* still manages to provide a satisfying ride, especially in its bloody and intense second half. The latter half of the film delivers what one expects from a horror movie-gripping tension, shocking moments, and a visceral level of gore.For those seeking a horror film that meets its promises without overcomplicating things, *Sinners* should not disappoint. It's a solid addition to the genre, with a compelling cast, strong performances, and a storyline that keeps you engaged despite a few predictabilities. If you love a good supernatural thriller with rich historical undertones, this one is worth the watch."

They keep circling around the same one-dimensional nonsense, with no actual development-just an hour of pretending it's going somewhere.The script is riddled with so many inconsistencies, it's honestly insulting to even start listing them. It's obvious that the director has no idea what horror, comedy, or drama actually are; he uses them as nothing more than schematic facades to deliver his elementary message. He can't even execute a cliché properly-he fails to activate it, leaving it brain-dead and pointless.The film maintains a mediocre level as it mimics the plot structure of \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", but the moment it transitions into horror, it completely collapses on every front. The music was the only decent thing in the first half of the film, but after that it lost its identity. Honestly, I can't believe that movies like this are allowed to artificially boost their ratings because I have no other explanation for such a rating."

          "content": "Sinners is the cinematic equivalent of throwing every genre into a blender, hitting purée, and pouring the resulting sludge onto the screen. What could have been a bold and innovative film turns out to be an incoherent, sluggish, and frankly offensive mess. This movie tries so desperately to be everything at once-horror, drama, social commentary, action, even a touch of romance-that it ends up being nothing at all.From the opening scenes, Sinners makes it painfully clear that pacing is not a priority. The first act drags on with excruciatingly slow exposition, awkward dialogue, and scenes that seem to serve no purpose other than to fill time. Instead of building suspense or investing the viewer in its characters, it just plods along, hoping something will eventually stick. Spoiler: it doesn't.The plot centers around a small rural town plagued by a secret society of vampires who operate like a cultish clan. So far, so cliché. But instead of leaning into the horror aspect and crafting a chilling atmosphere, the film veers off into strange tangents-attempting to wedge in political subtext, family drama, religious critique, and social justice themes. While genre blending can work when done skillfully (Get Out, for example), Sinners lacks the finesse or narrative focus to pull it off.The biggest issue, however, isn't the lazy pacing or genre confusion-it's the film's unsettling racial undertones. In Sinners, the villains are almost exclusively white characters portrayed as grotesque, bloodthirsty monsters (literally and figuratively). They're not just vampires-they're depicted as a metaphor for everything wrong with society: racism, patriarchy, religious fanaticism, and generational wealth. The vampires are also part of a secretive white clan-like group that feeds on minorities, both figuratively and literally.Now, calling out injustice in art is one thing-many powerful films do that successfully. But Sinners doesn't offer critique; it offers caricature. Instead of exploring racism with depth or nuance, it flips the script to demonize an entire group in the most literal way possible. Every white character who isn't a complete buffoon is either a vampire or complicit in their crimes. There's no room for complexity, growth, or humanity. The film doesn't challenge prejudice-it replaces it with a different form of prejudice.This approach is not only intellectually lazy, it's counterproductive. By painting one entire race as evil and another as perpetual victims, Sinners inadvertently replicates the very power dynamics it claims to fight. It's the cinematic equivalent of fighting fire with gasoline.Worse yet, this isn't done with subtlety or self-awareness. The film pats itself on the back for its \"edginess,\" but ends up feeling like a parody of woke filmmaking. It tries so hard to be socially relevant that it forgets to be a good movie. There's no suspense, no emotional stakes, and certainly no reason to care about any of the cardboard cutout characters who deliver wooden lines in service of a clunky narrative.Visually, the film is a drab, gray mess. Scenes meant to be dark and moody just come off as poorly lit. The vampire effects are laughable, and the few action scenes that do exist are so choppily edited they're hard to follow. The soundtrack is forgettable, the direction uninspired, and the climax so predictably preachy that you can see the \"message\" coming from a mile away.It's clear that the creators of Sinners wanted to say something meaningful, but the final product is more divisive than thought-provoking. Instead of engaging with complex themes, the film relies on easy targets, shallow metaphors, and tired tropes. It doesn't start a conversation-it ends it before it begins, smugly certain of its own moral high ground.In the end, Sinners sins not by being bold, but by being so sure of its own righteousness that it forgets the most basic rule of storytelling: tell a good story. This film is not profound. It's not scary. It's not moving. It's just a long, boring, confused, and offensive disappointment."

The supporting cast is just as compelling, and together they make every emotional beat hit exactly as it should.Cinematography, music, direction-everything works in harmony. It's not overproduced or showy, but you can tell every detail was handled with intention. The atmosphere it creates is haunting, beautiful, and intimate.Sinners is the kind of movie that reminds you why storytelling matters. It's about brokenness, yes, but also about healing and hope.

          "content": "Remember that scene in South Park when Stan & Kenny went to watch \"The Passion of the Christ\" and Stan says; \"Wow...That movie sucked!\" That's pretty much \"Sinners\"As a fan of Ryan Coogler's work, I was very interested to see how he would direct a film involving vampires with rural 1930's Mississippi. The film exposition takes way too long to introduce the characters involving Michael B. Jordan playing twins. Even though the film sets up the characters, we barely have time to know the actual vampires and how the Native Americans are chasing them to a small cottage. What seems to be the start of the 2nd act turns into the 3rd act spontaneously when the surviving humans fight off against the vampires.The film itself have a lot of plot holes and specific characters would've made more sense to be turned into vampires. For a film that built the exposition for the majority of the cast, it would've made sense if Sammie's father; Pastor Jedidiah had explained more of Sammie's connection involving the vampires or the evil that would come for him. The film says that Annie; Smoke's estranged wife suddenly has a knowledge of vampires and knows how to fight the vampires.MAJOR SPOILERS 1/2:\nWhen Smoke ambushes and kills Hogwood and the Klan the next morning, he pulled out his WWI locker with weapons & ammunition to kill the Klan. My reaction seeing that scene was \"Where was that locker when they needed it to fight the vampires?!\" Again, it would've made sense in the story if the vampire trio had turn Hogwood and the Klan into vampires. Making the scene of the surviving humans fight off two types of evil.MAJOR SPOILERS 2/2:\nSeeing Sammie 60 years later and going through a \"Post Credit Scene\" to have Vampire Stack & Mary meeting up with Sammie could've been in the film instead of 20 seconds of credits and then have the scene shown. If they wanted to keep that scene, they either could've trimmed it down for the film or have Sammie kill the vampire Stack & Mary.In addition, the second \"Post Credit Scene\" of Sammie singing in the church with the guitar was probably Ryan Coogler giving Miles Caton the last scene of the movie as a gift or a favor. Nice scene but had nothing to do with the film or the storyOverall, the hype of this film is extremely inflated and almost unnecessary. It barely passes an \"R\" rating, it seems like the film went through a lot of rewrites and kind of forgot the main plot of the film. Some scene could've been executes a lot better and the main plots were pretty much forgotten. Pretty much this film tries to use metaphors in its story but was not used correctly. I had higher expectation of this film but it was pretty much a mess. If you want to see a better Humans versus Vampires film, watch \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" directed by Robert RodriguezPros:\n-Casting was amazing. Michael B. Jordan delivers a great performance\n-Practical Effects & Make-Up we're fine. Not the best but passableCons:\n-Story was everywhere and forgot the main plot\n-Critical characters were forgotten or misused\n-Lots of Plot Holes in the film\n-2 unnecessary \"Post Credit Scenes\" that were used."

However, the execution is so painfully slow and lacking in emotional depth that the story quickly becomes tedious. There's no real sense of urgency or progression; scenes drag on without building tension, and by the time the plot attempts to introduce some sort of twist or climax, the audience has long since checked out."

The flow and vibe was something I haven't seen in some time. Michael B Jordan was brilliant. There was a clear distinction between the characters he played. The look, the dialogue, the music all hit just right and I have a feeling I will be wearing this movie out once I get it. Already downloaded the soundtrack and hope they expand it. I won't spoil anything but the authenticity of the time period feels so genuine and real. Don't hesitate and go see this. I promise you will not be disappointed."

          "content": "This is my first review. I was extremely annoyed because it's obvious that the IMDB rating of this film is artificially boosted, and that misled me into going to the cinema. The movie was full of mistakes and, to me, it was at an amateur level. A VERY AMATEUR LEVEL!!! Honestly, on our way out, the discussion about all the mistakes lasted longer than the film itself. In the end, the question came up - what was the screenwriter's motivation - what was the message - there was no character development, no real main protagonist, the relationships between characters were superficial - total chaos. At least the horror parts could have been scary. Halfway through, you could feel the writer struggling to keep the scenes going - relying on clichés and cheap humor - the characters lacked depth and meaning. I felt like the only goal of the movie was simply to exist. Maybe they found a sponsor with low cinematic culture and had to mislead people using SCAM techniques to earn some. I see it's making quite a profit."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is a cinematic mixtape - a genre-blending, jazz-soaked vampire film set against the backdrop of the Jim Crow era. It moves between horror and period drama, drives into the blood-soaked bravado of a gangster epic, embraces action fantasy and ascends into spiritual parable. And yet it never loses its sense of rhythm, never forgets the beat it's dancing to. It's cool, confident, and full of soul. We've seen Ryan Coogler's brilliance before (Creed, Black Panther) but Sinners is his first fully original cinematic world. It shows what he can do when the canvas is entirely his. Not just directing, but world-building, storytelling and crafting - this is Coogler the auteur.The film doesn't claim to be wholly original - and that's not a weakness. It plays like a remix of cinematic and cultural memory. There are echoes of From Dusk Till Dawn, with its genre-shifting sleight of hand, and tonal shades of Blade, packed in John Coltrane. Coogler draws from across the archive, but fuses these elements into something undeniably alive. It's not derivative - it's deliberate. And it works.When Sammy takes up his guitar, reality seems to ripple. Coogler and his cinematographer allow the camera to roam, gliding through the space as if possessed. Musicians from different eras appear, summoned by the raw beauty of Sammy's playing. It's bold, imaginative, and emotionally stirring - a sequence that captures the film's deepest message: the transcendent and escapist power of creativity. Art as time travel. Music as magic.Technically, Sinners is breathtaking. Ludwig Göransson's is a genius. His score feels like it's own entity, living inside the film, pulsing with improvisational energy and emotional nuance. The editing moves with the grace of jazz, sometimes syncopated, sometimes smooth. The cinematography is rich with texture and atmosphere - smoky, saturated, alive. Every frame feels considered, every cut in rhythm with the story's heartbeat. Performances are uniformly strong, but Michael B. Jordan in particular delivers a quiet intensity that deepens every scene he's in.There's also deep thematic weight: a critique of religious repression, especially in the tension between Sammy and his preacher father. The film explores the collision between tradition and expression, duty and desire - and does so without being preachy.If there's one flaw, it's in the final act. After such a beautifully paced and build-up first and second act - the finale feels like it races past the emotional crescendo rather than sitting in it. The post-credit scene is an absolute gem - a 60-year time jump that reframes the story not as something concluded, but something still echoing forward. Still alive.In the end, Sinners is pure movie magic - the kind of film that reminds you why you love cinema. It ignites that spark. A film made with vision, heart, and craft. This will soon become a certified classic. Can't wait to experience it again.9/10."

As the movie went on I began to realize I was watching a good version of \"Get Out\" with actors from Malcolm X. It was pretty evident that the film makers were saying that any form of whiteness is bad. The person that lets the \"devil\" in, is half-white. All the white characters are literally bloodthirsty savages. The thing is, it's all backed up by the bible, voodoo mysticism, and tribalism, so the movie seems to be saying it's okay to hate certain groups when you're not one of them. Apparently it's not a double standard when looking at it from their chosen perspective.We could all not be separatists and embrace each other as is logical, but that's not what Hollywood wants. The movie and their ideologies wouldn't make sense if you melded cultures. It has to be one sided, and forever divided between race lines, as described by the movies in 2025."

          "content": "I was genuinely impressed by Sinners. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was better than I expected, especially from Michael Jordan and the rest of the cast. The film did a great job capturing the atmosphere of 19th century America. The jazz scene, the costumes, the setting everything worked together to create a really strong vibe and It was nice to see Black America portrayed well.However, my biggest issue was with the story, particularly when the twins returned. They came back with a clear agenda and suddenly bought land and started setting up a bar within 24 hours. It didn't feel natural. From recruiting people to sourcing food, bumping into exes, and opening up shop all in one day it felt like it was leading to something much darker, like a secret ritual or a sacrifice for eternal youth.But then, out of nowhere, vampires appeared. The film shifted genres in the last thirty minutes with almost no proper setup. The only hint we got was the scene with the Klansmen, and even that was too vague to prepare us for where the story was headed. The transition from retired gangsters to supernatural horror felt jarring and disconnected from the plot that had been building.There was so much missed potential here. If you're into jazz and blues lore, then you know how rich the mythology is around artists like Robert Johnson, who supposedly sold his soul to the devil to play the guitar. That kind of legend could have been woven perfectly into this story. Imagine if Sam's guitar was actually Johnson's, carrying supernatural properties. The vampire's obsession with it would have made sense, and the film could have explored themes of legacy, power, and the cost of talent.Instead, the guitar's backstory was underwhelming just an abusive father's instrument which felt like a letdown after all the mystery surrounding it. Even at the end, when Sam is old and revived and plays again, they could have tied everything together. The twin could have admitted he had been searching for the guitar for years, and maybe there was an old inscription on it initials like RJ pointing to something much bigger. That would have been a powerful closing note.All in all, Sinners had the bones of something great. It looked fantastic, sounded rich, and had strong performances. But the story veered off-course and missed several opportunities to elevate the experience through deeper cultural and mythological roots."

I went with my brother and my aunt and we weren't disappointed for a second. Sinners is made for the big screen as it's not just a movie, but it is an experience. Ryan Coogler known for Creed and Black Panther once again confidently showcases why he's one of the best filmmakers working today. He just never misses. He always brings a distinct vision and style to his movies even amongst big studio movies where all of that often gets lost. This movie offers quite a bit for everyone. If you want some social commentary in your films it's there, if you don't it's not done in a negative or obnoxious way. If you want just a really great gangster movie set in the 30s it features that too. If you're a horror fanatic and all you want is vampire action and gore your patience will be rewarded. It combines all these elements together in a really special way and gives you those fun and bloody horror elements, but also gives you time to know these characters and this world which whenever all hell breaks loose it is much more impactful. This movie does have a lot to say and has a lot of love put into it. Sinners is a unique take on a vampire movie that tells its story with music, and a lot of soul, and the entire cast expertly brings it all to life. It goes without saying, yeah, we really liked it."

It's stylish with impressive music and visuals, whilst all of the acting talent give good performances. It's paced astutely too.Michael B. Jordan is as entertaining as he usually tends to be, I do like seeing him act. The dual role is done well here, the 'split screen' is solid but my brain sillily - no matter the movie or standard of how they portray the same actor twice - simply cannot interpret the effect as seamless.Jack O'Connell stands out behind Jordan, particularly for the moments of sing. Hailee Steinfeld and Wunmi Mosaku are the others that I took notice of too, same can be said for Delroy Lindo, Li Jun Li and Omar Miller; I oddly always think of 'American Pie Presents: Band Camp' with the latter (I'm so sorry, Omar).I must say, the trailers revealed too much. I tend to avoid those so assume I didn't get the full brunt of it anyway, though even so I remember catching a couple of bits that don't occur until the gritty part of the movie. It's no biggie, trailers are designed to get bums on seats after all."

You completely by him as each of these twins with their own personality. Miles Caton also does fantastic in his first role as a young man trying to start up his blues career. He has a great singing voice and he leads a phenomenal musical section in the film. If you can see the movie in Dolby, that scene will take your breath away. Jack O'Connell does a great job as the antagonist. Coogler put so much care into this film with great cinematography, the music which is just fantastic, to the story that takes a great turn. I was entrapped the entire time watching. The only small complaints I had was the over reliance on the CGI blood that looked bad at some parts and a bad edited action sequence.

I guess the writer put them there just to make a political parallel.I also have to mention that the post credit scene saved this movie big time. It was masterfully done that draws you back in, and makes you connected to the story and the characters in 3 minutes, something that the entire movie had trouble establishing during 2 whole hours.Anyway, if you are looking for an entertaining flick without too much depth, slick cinematography, and a shallow political commentary, then go for it, but if you expect it be a superb horror movie, or some grand storytelling masterpiece then you better find something else."

Set against the backdrop of 1930s Mississippi, the film delves into the lives of twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, portrayed compellingly by Michael B. Jordan. His dual performance adds a personal touch of intrigue, showcasing his versatility and depth as an actor.The film's initial half is gripping, drawing viewers into a world where the lines between reality and the supernatural blur. Director Ryan Coogler masterfully builds tension, introducing elements of folklore, music, and societal issues that enrich the storyline.However, as the narrative progresses, the momentum slightly wanes. The later part of the film shifts in tone, diverging from the suspenseful buildup established earlier. This transition might catch some viewers off guard, as it steers the story in an unexpected direction. Yet, this deviation isn't necessarily detrimental; it offers a different perspective that challenges conventional horror tropes.The conclusion may leave audiences with mixed feelings, potentially questioning the film's resolution. Nevertheless, a post-credits scene provides clarity, tying together loose ends and offering a deeper understanding of the overarching narrative. This final touch ensures that viewers depart with a comprehensive grasp of the film's message and intent.In essence, Sinners is a commendable attempt at redefining horror cinema. While it may not cater to everyone's expectations, its unique approach and Michael B. Jordan's standout performance make it a noteworthy watch."

Equally impressive is the dynamic between the twin characters, both played by Michael B. Jordan, who brings intensity and depth to each role - a true testament to the film's strong direction and technical quality.Sure, some of the special effects didn't fully convince me, but honestly, that's a minor flaw in an otherwise bold and unique film.If you're looking for something different, exciting, and far from predictable, I highly recommend giving this one a watch.

This vampire-western-horror hybrid, laced with bluesy musical undertones and Afro-diasporic spirituality, is as messy as it is mesmerizing. It's Coogler's first fully original feature, and you can feel him swinging for the fences, packing in enough ideas to fuel a trilogy. Yet, somehow, it mostly works.Michael B. Jordan is phenomenal in dual roles, bringing both ferocity and vulnerability to twin brothers caught in a nightmarish survive-the-night scenario. The ensemble-Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Mosaku, Hailee Steinfeld-elevates every scene, with Lindo stealing the show as a weathered, soulful patriarch. Ludwig Göransson's score is a character in itself, pulsing with dread and beauty, while the cinematography captures the dusty, blood-soaked Southern Gothic vibe perfectly.The film's genre-blending can feel overstuffed at times, and a few narrative threads don't fully resolve, leaving you wanting more clarity. But the sheer audacity of Coogler's vision, paired with moments of raw humor, romance, and bone-chilling horror, makes it unforgettable. That \"conjuring spirits\" scene? An absolute game-changer-bold, visceral, and unlike anything I've seen in a blockbuster.This is a cinematic event that demands to be experienced, flaws and all. It's Coogler unleashed, and I'm here for it."

Jordan, who has participated in all Coogler projects) who return to their small Mississippi town after spending some time as gangsters in Chicago to live out their dream of opening a \"Juke Joint\" just outside the small Mississippi town they grew up in.The first part of the movie is darn-near Academy Award worthy as Coogler focuses his cameras/script on the characters - all of which are marginalized in this society (in other words they are non-white in the share cropper state of Mississippi). Smoke and Stack drive their dream of opening a Juke Joint recruiting friends and allies to assist along with a musical prodigy (young musician Miles Caton in his feature film debut) who's music (the legends tell) can bring the spirits (both good and bad) of the past and the future together in one place.And...that is what exactly happens in a wonderful dreamlike sequence that brings together the blues of the 1930's, African drummers of the past, medieval chants, futuristic rap and rock-n-roll in a dream-like sequence that is worth the price of admission.Along with Coogler's strong direction and writing, kudo's needs to be given to the Composer of this film, 2x Oscar Winner Ludwig Goransson (OPPENHEIMER) who blends these disparate musical genres together in a haunting and thrilling way that draws us all in.It also draws in \"bad spirits\" (and this is where the Vampire part of the story starts)...and it's a bloody good time.Besides Jordan's usual terrific performance (can one call him under-rated)? There are also strong acting turns by Caton, Wunmi Mosaku (Disney+ TV Series LOKI), Hailee Steinfeld (Kate Bishop in the MCU), \"that guy\" actor Omar Miller (the TV Series BALLERS) and just about every other performer in this show. They all shine because they are given something to do with very good writing and direction behind it.Oh...and special notice needs to be given to Veteran Actor Delroy Lindo (THE CIDER HOUSE RULES) who gives the \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" role in this film plenty of heart.A surprisingly deep, rich and emotional film wrapped up inside a Vampire film - a unique hybrid that might not find an audience. Those that love the emotional resonance might complain that Coogler ruins it with \"the vampire nonsense\" and the Vampire fans might be upset that Coogler doesn't get to the Vampire stuff soon enough.But, the BankofMarquis found it an interesting - and rich - mashup of 2 genres that put in the hands of a top-notch writer/director like Coogler, works very well, indeed.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank(ofMarquis)"

Give a director free reign and art is truly formed. I for one am really excited to see where he heads next and will certainly visit his previous works.All performances from the cast were solid, the horror and thriller elements were a blast, and special shoutout to Ludwig as the music absolutely made this movie. It really makes you realize the importance of music in movies and the fact that the soundtrack had a direct correlation to the story really helped bring everything together so well.Go see it!"

From his acting to his signing he was magnificent. Michael B Jordan was effortlessly cool playing twins. Hailee Steinfeld played against type which i liked. Delroy Lindo needs to be in way more movies that man is fantastic. Jack O'Connell was menacing and fantastic.Its essentially a musuc video, rich textured sort of vampire film but its so much more than a vampire film. MUST SEE."

Coogler pulls you in to this world and has you fall in love with the intricacies of each of his characters. No one is perfect, but everyone is trying to do what they think is best. The music and sound design are characters on their own and you get lost in the magic. There are so many songs that about midway through I started calling it a musical. The soundtrack definitely is a piece that I see myself listening to again and again. See it in theaters if you can!! This movie was made for the biggest screen possible with the best surround sound available!"

          "content": "Oh my god!!! I just came from the theaters after watch Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan's new movie SINNERS. This movie went completely beyond my expectations for it to be considered just another Ordinary horror movie. Not even 4 minutes into the viewing they're already scaring the crap out of you with cut in transition shots of the Monsters.The depth of originality present in it mixes well with the classic original tropes seen in a vampire movie. It's almost like a combination of a period drama, musical and action horror. In the first hour there is social commentary on how it was living in 1930's Jim Crow Mississippi Delta. The music...., oh lord the music was the back bone of this movie, today recordings from back then are erode over time and come out lacking the life of actually hearing 1930s blues, jazz, and other genres (back from when music was getting good and before it went bad after 2010) that have become lost to many in today's generation. One scene in particular was very moving, a song that begins in an old style until it mixes all of the different styles of music from the African American community in the last hundred years.Now, the big question, the Vampires? While it's not Dracula, id be lying if they didn't creep me out and scare me with their execution of a different take on them. While they become the threat later on, for most of the beginning they're not tied to it. You could say the first hour and half was us the audience looking back into the past of how a community used to end a week of work by throwing a party. Now when they revealed themselves, all hell broke loose, it was so tense that my heart was up my throat looking around the screen for when or where one would appear.The ending was the cherry on top, gives a well done resolution to a story that doesn't need a sequel or a prequel anytime soon. For now, Hollywood horror has a new modern classic in the same way NOPE left us Thrilled and horrified 3 years ago."

It's a blues, 1930s piece of vampire fun overall though there are the sins. I feel that the vampires that are heard as the haters several times and the beginning it seems that wants to say racism is bad but there so many times when it hits to the point it becomes like beating a dead horse. The violence was gruesome but tanned by the light like in the sense of Taxi Driver. Though somewhat to gruesome. Then the language was constantly foul with the f-word and n-word used frequently. Then the last and major sin was graphic sex there is total of three major scenes that come up. It was gross and un-needed. I watched in Imax had half of a good time. If I watch again it will be through Vidangel."

From the reviews online, I thought this will be some unbelievable work of art that breaks the mold of storytelling while revolutionizing the horror genre with filming techniques that humans have never seen before. Well, it was far from that.Our protagonists are the twins Smoke and Stack who return to Mississippi after working for Al Capone in Chicago. They plan to open a Juke Joint for the local people to gather, drink and dance. During the first half of the movie they organize the logistics and personnel of the club but during the second half, they get a trio of surprise visitors who turn the evening into a bloody affair. Essentially, it is From Dusk Till Dawn with elements of Let the Right One In.The story had a good set up which introduced the characters in a concise yet informative way which was my favorite part of the movie. Then as the film progressed, I was constantly expecting something grand to occur considering all the hype. Yet as I watched, nothing noteworthy happened so I thought maybe it was all about the ending. So I began to expect some massive twist or maybe some earth shattering revelation but alas, neither of those things happened and the film just ended.The music was absolutely outstanding and it brought life to every scene while the editing and the night cinematography created proper immersion. Contrary to that, the comedy constantly broke the serious atmosphere that the story tried to establish. Finally, when the vampires finally appeared, it sort of destroyed everything that was built in the interesting first half. Moreover, the pivotal sequence in act 3 was head scratchingly stupid and the villains often went from menacing monsters to comedic parodies. Happy for those of you who enjoyed Sinners more than I did!P. S. The post credit scene was one of the best parts of the film so don't miss it..Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest Film and TV reviews."

The movie runs for about two hours, and the entire first hour is just two brothers trying to gather people for the grand opening of a bar. That's it. We spend 60 minutes getting introduced to a few characters-something that could've been done in 15 minutes. The pacing is unbearably slow, and absolutely nothing happens. It's boring, dragged out, and lacks any sense of momentum.Then finally, the party begins. At this point, you expect some action, some drama-something-especially with the promised vampire-human conflict. But even here, the movie delivers very little. Aside from a few mildly amusing or shocking moments, there's nothing memorable. The climax is laughably bad: a childish fight scene where 6-7 people somehow survive an attack from 50 vampires... using wooden sticks. It's not thrilling-it's ridiculous.The only redeeming quality? The soundtrack. The songs and background score are surprisingly good and far better than the film deserves.Verdict: Skip it. Listen to the soundtrack instead."

And that's important because I feel a lot of the overly positive reviews are racially biased, as was the turnout in the cinema when we went to watch it. So let's dive into my (impartial) opinion of this movie. First off, it's at least 45 minutes too long. It attempts to provide some back story to the main characters but backfires due to the thick accent which is spoken throughout the movie. Without being too blatant, I'd wager that the average native English speaker (which I am) would struggle to understand the dialogue.Next are the characters. None of them stood out for me. In a good horror movie, I'd expect a hero and a villain who both shine and stay in the viewers' memories long after the minute finishes. But this is not the case. The attempt to provide a backstory is focused on the main protagonists only, and there is no information provided on the villains.Speaking about the racial aspect, I felt the last 15 minutes were like watching BLM propaganda which certainly does not belong in a horror movie. I get that the movie is set during a time when racial persecution was still prevalent but there's not added value in including that scene.The only thing that I enjoyed in this movie was the blues music and the Irish folk song. Nothing more, nothing less. For that, I'll give the movie a 2/10."

Jordan for his dual performances of Smoke and Stack-twins whose life paths deviate drastically when offered a deal with the devil.

Some viewers will love it precisely for this hybrid, elusive nature. Personally, however, it didn't strike me as particularly original.Many ideas seem borrowed from Tarantino, starting with \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", and throughout the screening, I couldn't help but think about how much of a true genius Tarantino is at handling this kind of material. Similarly, \"Angel Heart\" by Alan Parker depicted damnation and the sensuality of the blues with far greater power.The theme of social revenge, which should have been one of the film's main drivers, is reduced to simplistic metaphors, more suited to a middle school essay than to a serious piece of filmmaking. In the end, Sinners is saved by the strong performances of its cast, an effective soundtrack, and a few striking visual moments."

It has a good idea with vampires in the south and the blues but it was all over the place. Honestly it would have been better as a mini series with more character development especially the twins and the time before they come home. I will say all the actors did a great job and the music was amazing. Just some more time needed to move the story along with so many characters introduced. I guess after the raving reviews and high scores from others I expected a better film. I would say wait til streaming save your money and this way you can fast forward the slower parts of the film."

Ok, I get why the main vampire lied his way into the home of husband and wife Klan members, and turned them. But, why? At dusk, the juke joint gets to popping and I suppose \"devil music and the sort\" brings out devil people, hence vampires, who must be invited in to devour you and turn you into one of them. I get that. That's pretty much the running theme on vampirism, as well as how to destroy them. But \"the evil that awaits them\" leaves you with, but why? Were the Native Americans chasing the main vampire in the beginning the only people in Mississippi who knew that they existed? Where did they come from? Why did the main vampire want the kid, Sammie, so desperately? Because he was a preacher's son who warned him about mingling with \"sinners\" and their devil music and ways? Good vs. Evil? Ok, I get that, but, well... that's it. Expected much more and it did not deliver. Sorry..."

It's impressive given that this is the director's first attempt at horror. Coogler is a bit of a hit or miss director for me. I like the first Black Panther, but not Black Panther 2. I think Creed is overrated. Still, this film definitely interested me from the trailers and poster, and it didn't disappoint.This film definitely feels like the movie From Dusk Till Dawn. I would say this is that film for a new generation. I would be shocked if that film isn't at least somewhat an inspiration for Sinners. It follows a similar structure where the first half of the film is all setup and character building, and the vampires don't factor in until the second half. For anyone who's a fan of From Dusk Till Dawn, or vampire films in general (vampire horror films at least), this is definitely worth seeing.It's a great-looking movie. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen. The music is great, particularly in one sequence. Those who've seen the film will know what I'm talking about. In most movies, a sequence like that would feel jarring and out of place, but Coogler somehow managed to make it work. Everyone in the cast does a good job, particularly Michael B Jordan. I've always liked him as an actor, but he's never had a truly amazing role, at least since Chronicle. It was interesting seeing him play two different characters and having both feeling very distinct.The one issue I have is pacing. This is a long movie, and you can feel it at points, especially at the end. The ending felt like it went on a bit longer than it needed to. From Dusk Till Dawn is a tighter film than this. It never overstayed its welcome."

Ryan Coogler wrote, produced, and directed this film. Michael B. Jordan gets to showcase his acting skills here playing twins on screen. This may be Michael B. Jordan's best film as well. This movie has everything from the Blues, navigating through racism in Mississippi in the 30's, a gangster element, and of course Vampires! This movie did remind me a little of From Dusk Till Dawn but not entirely. Ryan Coogler has crafted an original film here that has everything in it. The movie also really earns it's R rating with the violence, sex scenes, and language. Hailee Steinfield, and Miles Caton also really shine here with their performances. Sinners gets a perfect score of 10 stars out of 10."

          "content": "Coogler deviates from traditional three-act storytelling, opting instead for a tapestry of interwoven arcs that converge in a climatic confrontation. While this structure allows for rich character exploration, it occasionally leads to narrative fragmentation. The film's pacing, particularly in the final act, may feel disjointed as it shifts focus to high-octane action sequences.The climax, while visually arresting, leans heavily on spectacle, potentially overshadowing the emotional and thematic depth established earlier. This shift might leave some viewers yearning for a more cohesive resolution that aligns with the film's initial narrative richness.The film boasts exceptional technical craftsmanship. Cinematographer Autumn Durald captures the humid, haunting atmosphere of the Mississippi Delta, while Carter's costume designs vividly evokes the era. Ludwig Goransson's blues infused score adds a huanting layer to the narrative, enhancing the film's emotional resonance.Sinners is a visually stunning and thematically ambitious film that pushes the boundaries of genre cinema. While its unconventional narrative structure and final act may not resonate with all viewers, it technical excellence and powerful performances make it a standout entry in contemporary horror. Coogler's fusion of historical realism and supernatural elements offers a fresh perspective on familiar tropes, solidifying Sinners as a significant cinematic achievement.For those seeking a film that challenges conventions and offers a rich tapestry of themes, Sinners is a must watch. However, viewers should be prepared for a narrative that prioritizes thematic exploration over traditional storytelling structure."

There is one part where an older gentleman is telling a story from his past and the sounds that are added create another layer of storytelling that makes the viewer feel engrossed with his experience.

There's a sequence midway through that left me stunned, a breathtaking and soul-stirring tribute to the roots of American music past and present, and the profound and irreplaceable influence of formerly enslaved Black Americans. The cast is phenomenal, the storytelling bold, and the entire film pulses with life, fury, and beauty. I don't want to spoil anything, but just go in with an open heart and mind.

So not only was extremely entertaining like a lot of other horror films, but it gets its extra point from having a real plot and theme that you can walk away with. This is one of those movies that has sprinkles of cinematic brilliance all throughout making it an extremely entertaining watch on the big screen. The acting is extremely compelling, funny & realistic at the same time. The only thing I would criticize is the pacing & lack of a score. The movie starts slow and then picks up very quickly where I wish it would ease into the climax a little more to increase tension. Other than that, highly recommend 9/10z."

The cast brings raw energy and emotional depth that anchors the film's darker, more surreal elements in something human and tangible.That said, the pacing in the first half feels a bit indulgent. While the slow burn helps establish tone and character, it comes at the cost of exploring one of the most intriguing aspects of the story-the vampire's relationship with the music maker. Their connection is hinted at but never fully fleshed out, which feels like a missed opportunity in a film that teases a deep mythos just beneath the surface.The mid-film 30-vampire-on-6-people showdown is as ridiculous as it sounds, but also undeniably entertaining. However, the abrupt, almost casual death of the vampires undercuts what could've been a show-stopping climax. Instead, we pivot to a sudden shootout involving the Klan-a jarring and, frankly, unnecessary detour that dilutes the impact of the vampire narrative.Still, despite these narrative stumbles, Sinners is an ambitious, stylish, and engaging piece of genre filmmaking. With a bit more focus on its lore and a more refined ending, it could've been a genre classic. As it stands, it's a compelling watch with flashes of brilliance."

The Negro Spiritual was another matter, however, and the American activist and sociologist thought so highly of their social and political influences as to preface each chapter of his landmark book, The Souls of Black Folk (1903) with an example of a Negro Spiritual. What Ryan Coogler has done with this latest cinematic offering and outing is bring thematic clarification to these various musical genres through the trials and tribulations of his characters rather than with any appeal to the resources of didacticism. He has accomplished a volcanically gripping piece of cinema that demonstrates a surprising level of sophistication from an Afro-centric point-of-view.There is nothing particularly surprising about the narrative in this rich, turgid Down South horror story. Once I saw Saul Williams portraying Pastor Jedidiah Moore and sporting an Afro that was styled devilishly similar to the haircut The Space Phantom wore in THE AVENGERS Issue #2, I just crossed my fingers and waited. I can spot a good old-fashioned Devil's Tale a mile away, and when Miles Canton as the prodigal son, Sammie \"Preacher Boy\" Moore bursts through the doors of that ramshackle white church to confront his pastor father, guitar in hand, I was hoping this would be as good as I expected. Let it be known this is a yarn that does not disappoint, and even the Devil would chuckle that he got his due. But I do not believe even Stagolee would have been prepared for the off-the-charts cohesive lyricism of this piece of corn pone noir.The dialogue in Coogler's screenplay is sharp, witty, and on point, owing in no small measure to the influence of the Rap and Hip-Hop movements, but the inflections and intonations of Down South speech patterns carry an unmistakable ring of authenticity. The driving pace is full of an air of foreboding that never feels rushed and yet never slackens as it moves headlong towards it grisly conclusion. Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography doesn't miss a trick, and indeed, at times seems to invent a few in the still of the night. But the work of musician and composer Ludwig Goransson contributes much to the unifying fusion of music, song and dance that are the warp and the woof of the information sharing systems of the African and African American milieu. Michael P. Shawver's editing is also an indispensable feature of the multi-faceted craft that makes this work so appealing. There is nothing to be found wanting or lacking in the production values presented by Coogler's wife Zinzi Coogler, Sev Ohanian or Ryan Coogler himself as there is high quality in nearly every frame of this picture.At 90 million, this film was definitely not produced on a shoestring budget, and it shows. For my money, Michael B. Jordan presents an Oscar winning tour de force performance as the twin brothers Eligah \"Smoke\" Moore and Elias \"Stack\" Moore. Can I hear you say \"Smoke Stack Lightning\" (1956)? There is always a subtle differentiation between the two brothers so that you never get confused as to who is who. Hailee Steinfeld makes for an enticing (she's passing for white!) femme fatale as Mary, and Li Jun Li brings her share of pyrogenic angst and agony to her role as Grace Chow along with Yao as her conflicted husband Bo Chow. But it is refreshing and inspiring to see the darker skinned sisters Wunmi Mosaku as hoodoo woman Annie and Jayme Lawson as the juke joint singer Pearline carry most of the romantic heat through to the end of the narrative.But it isn't all Spirituals, Blues and coochie Jazz music. The ensemble produces a striking and unexpected Country and Celtic Music counterpoint in the performances of poor white trash Jack O'Connell as Remmick, Lola Kirke as Joan and Peter Dreimanis among others. It is this striking clash of Afro and Euro musical and cultural perspectives that brings to a peak the greatest suspense. Director Coogler is not above referencing various influences and there is plenty to choose from here. But his chief achievement is that this Down South Neo-noir chitlins chiller flows visually like a piece of music suggesting that it is primarily generated from an Afro-centric basis. Whether its corn cobs or potato shavings with coffee grounds nothing is left out of the hog trough in this juke joint slaughterhouse."

          "content": "The later trailers for Sinners give away a major plot point that will discussed in this review. It isn't a spoiler as such, since its integral to the nature of the film and its hard to see how the movie could have been advertised without showing it, but if you haven't seen the marketing, simply go and watch this astonishing work of film making and come back later. If you've already seen it, or know what kind of film it is, read on.To date, director Ryan Coogler's big screen credits are; true story \"Fruitvale Station\", Rocky franchise sequel \"Creed\" and two MCU movies (\"Black Panther\" and its sequel). If you've marvelled at how he has managed to infuse those franchise movies with both deeply personal meaning and wide cultural themes, and wondered what he could achieve with a project that is purely his own, then Sinners is your answer and it is glorious. In a rare studio win, Warner Brothers deserve credit for funding a wholly original R-rated movie to the tune of close to $100 million and Coogler has repaid them handsomely. This is a pristinely shot period piece set in the 1930s Jim Crow South. It is an ode to music and culture and the power and danger of both. It is one of the great vampire movies.Micheal B. Jordan plays twin brothers Smoke and Stack, returning after a seven year absence to their hometown. A place in which they had a fearsome reputation even before they went and fought in WWI and became gangsters in Chicago. Flush with cash they are looking to set up a \"Juke Joint\" for people to drink, gamble, dance and party the night away, safe from the racist attentions of local landowners and a very much still active KKK. The first portion of the film plays out like a heist movie, as the twins set up shop and get the gang together. We meet Preacher Boy (an incredible debut film performance from Mile Canton), the twins young cousin with the voice and musical talent of a veteran blues singer, Annie (Wunmi Mosaic), Smoke's estranged wife who he shared a child with, shop owners and business people the Chows (Li Jun Li and Yao), Omar Benson Miller as Cornbread, the bouncer, Stack's former flame Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), sultry singer Pearline (Jayme Lawson) and veteran blues man Delta Simm (a scene stealing Delroy Lindo). Every cast member is top notch and Jordan pulling double duty is somehow not distracting at all. Very little is done to make the twins look visually different but there is no point where it isn't obvious who is who. We see the difference in their opinion on family and business, how they perceive and wish to be perceived, but also that they are two sides of the same coin, charming and magnanimous but ready to kill at a moments notice if necessary.We are deep into the runtime before Vampires raises their head, but when they do, Sinners does become a vampire movie, just one where the temptation has a little more meaning and we feel the deaths a little more. This isn't a prestige film half heartedly using the metaphorical idea of vampirism to make a point, these are full throated, sharp toothed, flying, garlic and sun light hating, invite us in, bloodsuckers. We are told at the beginning of the film that musical genius is close to the Devine, able to connect people across generations stretching through history and into the future (this is shown visually in one of the most unforgettable scenes put to film in recent years, you'll know it when you see it). We are also told such talent calls out to the evil that lurks in shadows of the world. When the party picks up pace, loud sweaty and sexy (intimacy is a recurring theme) and Preacher Boy is in full voice, he attracts the attention of Jack O'Connell's softly spoken vampire, Remmick. He is a very Celtic kind of devil, charming with the folk songs of his ancestors, dancing jigs and tempting with gold. It is no coincidence the protagonists are menaced by a vampire, that most European of nasties, as Remmick is the walking embodiment of colonialism. For all his talk of togetherness he is really seeking to consume the culture of others for his own ends. If there is one criticism to be made, it would be that things start to feel a little contrived come the final showdown but if you're going to bring vamps to the party you may as well play the hits.The film is dense in metaphor and incredibly textured with sound and song woven throughout more crucially than in most musicals. It is both the central theme of the movie and the gloss that gives it its stylistic identity, with the combination of blues and folk combining for a belting soundtrack. Beyond the songs, the score and sound design work in tandem to control the mood. Effects, music keys and silence are used to create bombastic and eerie moments. It is also a film that, for all the darkness, isn't afraid to have fun, with entertaining banter and jokes breaking the tension and homage paid to some genre classics. We even get a riff on the classic \"which of us is it\" scene from The Thing.Sinners is both a soaring period piece and a searing genre movie. It is also a film that will gnaw its way into your soul. Essential viewing that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the most thumping speakers.9 people waiting on the other side out of 10."

I was FINALLY able to watch Sinners (they weren't playing it near me) and I wasn't disappointed.Ryan Coogler tells a compelling narrative with characters you can connect to on some level. It's rare in modern horror movies to see fully fleshed out people but Sinners managed to make me care about everyone's fate.The casting director needs a raise because everyone was perfectly cast. The villain in particular gave me chills. Sinners uses the vampire lore amazingly. Vampires are known to play with their prey/food and it's showcased brilliantly here thanks to a mix of both excellent screenwriting and a memorable performance from the antagonist.Additionally, how everyone in this film reacts to/deals with the vampires makes sense. A great amount of dread sprinkled in with unexpected humor provided a unique take on this classic supernatural threat.People are FINALLY giving Hailee Steinfeld more praise/credit thanks to her role here (rightfully so but I have to point out I'm a day 1 fanboy 😂)Michael B. Jordan portrayed the twins really well. His range here reminded me of Robert Pattinson in Mickey 17 a little bit, absolutely believable.On top of the incredible acting, scares, and humor - the music was also elite.I was honestly surprised how the movie evolved from the beginning to end. On one hand it's a period piece however ultimately it changes to the horror movie Sinners was marketed as.-There's a lot more depth/complexity to the narrative than I thought there would be. I shouldn't have expected anything less considering it's Ryan Coogler we are talking about. The beautiful thing about Sinners though is that the commentary is woven into the story so well that it requires critical thinking or even a rewatch to wrap your head around everything. Conversely, if you're looking for an entertaining horror-vampire flick with action you get that too without in your face social commentary.This is Ryan Coogler's best work.Overall Sinners is the best movie I've seen this year so far."

The choice of actors was also perfect, everyone gave an amazing performance, I even give a special mention to the actor Michael B. Jordan who played the twins.

I say yes, and maybe even something rarer, a musical storyteller in his own right.This is a vampire movie draped in style, Ryan Coogler gangster swagger meets deep Southern gothic, it's cool in every sense of the word, Michael B. Jordan dual performances are hypnotic, a true devil's bargain of a role, while Hailee Steinfeld and the rest of the cast shine just as fiercely.At 137 minutes, Sinners doesn't just entertain, it casts a spell, there's a mythic quality throughout, something that echoes the old blues legend of Robert Johnson at the crossroads, striking his fateful deal.I also love when a film refuses to stay locked in its own era, Sinners toys with the future, blending timelines like a guitar bending notes into something almost supernatural, one particular scene, in fact, isn't just one of my favorites of the year, it might be one of my favorites of all time, perfectly performed, directed with fire, and lifted by an unforgettable score.Sinners is almost flawless, a true deal with the cinematic devil, and easily the best film of the year so far."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler is an incredibly talented director! However, since his powerful debut with Fruitvale Station, he hasn't made an original film, focusing instead on franchise hits like Creed and Black Panther. While those movies were great, it always felt like a bit of a missed opportunity to see what else he could create outside the bounds of established properties. Now, with Sinners, an original vampire movie, he finally returns to telling a wholly new story - and it's absolutely worth the wait.The performances across the board are phenomenal. The cast nails the 1930s setting, with many adopting accents that feel natural and immersive. Michael B. Jordan shines playing twin brothers, delivering two distinct characters without overexaggeration. Through subtle body language and presence, he makes it immediately clear which brother is on screen - one serious, one carefree. Delroy Lindo is an absolute scene-stealer, bringing humor and heart every time he appears. But the biggest standout is newcomer Miles Caton, who delivers a breathtaking debut performance. His career is definitely one to watch.The story itself is deeply engaging. On the surface, it follows the twin brothers returning home to start a juke joint, only to encounter a supernatural threat. But surprisingly, the vampires aren't the movie's main focus. Sinners is a love letter to music, particularly the Blues. In fact, the first 30 minutes are purely devoted to the brothers setting up the juke joint - gathering staff, advertising, and building community - and it's so compelling that I forgot this was even a vampire movie. There's also a musical sequence that stands among the best I've ever seen.The film's take on vampires feels fresh, too. Sinners introduces new rules and symbolism around vampirism, particularly tying into the idea of sin and consent - vampires must be invited in, a rule that plays beautifully into the story's deeper themes of guilt, temptation, and systemic racism. While the film's allegories are obvious at times, they are handled with care and avoid feeling heavy-handed.On a technical level, Sinners is gorgeous. Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography is stunning, with creative use of aspect ratio changes to enhance key scenes. Ludwig Göransson, returning to collaborate with Coogler, delivers an incredible score that is absolutely essential to the film's emotional resonance. Given that music is central to the story, Göransson had a huge task, and he completely delivers - I found myself completely swept up during the musical sequences. The costume and set design also deserve major praise for authentically bringing the era to life.If I have a few nitpicks, it's that the film occasionally falls into typical movie clichés, like villains hesitating when they could easily win. The main antagonist also feels underdeveloped - we don't get much insight into their backstory or how they became a vampire. Additionally, there's a strange choice to place the true ending as a mid-credit scene. It's not a Marvel-style tease, but a full 5-10 minute resolution that's crucial to the story. Unfortunately, some audience members missed it, assuming the film was over. It would have been better placed before the credits rolled.The greatest sin would be missing this movie. Sinners is a phenomenal film and easily one of the best of 2025 so far. I highly recommend seeing it in theaters to show studios that audiences want bold, original storytelling like this!"

The world is wounded, by human, why not erase half of them. So the rest would learn. Simple math.Now, Sinners, Mr. Remmick definitely makes his point. He brings a new way to be one in love and friendship. Yes, so far, never heard about fairytale of vampires betraying and hurting each other. Every soul is never really taken when the virus spread, instead they're freed.Taking the age and the dark era of America in 1920's, how no more such thing when both side grow their fangs. Same fang, same music, so let's dance together, forever.Reminds me to John Lennon, he wasn't entirely correct, tho, but Imagine is the spirit to carry on.Now for me, I really wanted to give 10 stars ... 'sigh' I wish Mr. Coogler didn't miss small thing like I'm about to state, when Remmick turns into spiral fire spinning up to the sky, Smoke and Sammy still frightenedly keep looking at same spot while it is no longer there."

          "content": "Seeing this in beautiful IMAX was a real treat. Even if you don't see it in IMAX, seeing it in a movie theater is the best way to experience Sinners.The performances are wonderful. Michael B. Jordan does a great job playing the twins Smoke and Stack. All of them are played, and each is unique and different. The brothers never feel the same. They love and support each other and act like real siblings. Hailee Steinfeld is always so good. It's great to see her playing another Southern character since she played Matty Ross in True Grit. She's beautiful, and bad-ass. In his first-ever acting role, Newcomer Miles Caton gives a fantastic performance. My favorite part of the film is how he can sing with so much power and emotion. This is their first film role ever; I hope we see more of him down the road. But the scene-stealer for me is Jack O'Connell. He gives such a fantastic performance. This film has a sequence where he dances and sings. It is such a tremendous scene to watch in IMAX. The way he can be terrifying and kind is so good. The rest of the cast also gives excellent performances.The movie has some fantastic blue music sequences that are well done. They are all so catchy and fun that I started tapping my shoe on the ground and even my my jaw dropped at some of the songs. I won't name one of them because it might be a spoiler, but it's a great song, one of my favorites in the film, and the music is top-notch overall.Cinematography\nIt was amazing. There's a fantastic one-take shot in this film. That got me excited to watch it on the big screen. It makes excellent use of wide shots, close-ups, and static shots, but one of my favorites is in the trailer when a character pops into the air and onto the ground, or the final action sequence at the end was so well shot crazy action-filled.Is the movie scary? Yes, it is. It can be very intense and will startle you. I got scared a couple of times because I am still getting used to watching horror films, but I am glad I watched all the way through because I was rewarded with one amazing film. Overall belive the hype of Sinners it is just that good it's bloody, violent, horrifying, sexy, and downright brutal Ryan Coogler gives us such a great vampire flick that Is tons of fun to watch and place don't watch it when it streams you will regret it!!!!"

Smoke, the calm and calculated one, and Stack, the impulsive hothead, are brought to life with incredible nuance. His ability to capture their differences without ever overplaying them shows a level of depth that few actors reach.The film's depiction of oppression through the metaphor of vampires was brilliant - illustrating how Black people's hard work, spirit, and creativity have historically been drained and stolen. Sinners isn't just a horror film; it's a powerful statement about survival, resistance, and the cost of resilience."

          "content": "Sinners (2025) is a haunting and atmospheric masterpiece that deserves much more attention than it's currently getting. What begins as a simple story of two brothers returning to their hometown after troubled pasts quickly unfolds into a deep, layered exploration of guilt, repression, and the dark history lurking beneath the surface of small-town faith. The film is bathed in an eerie, slow-burning tension, amplified by an outstanding use of music and cinematography that wraps around you like a nightmare you can't wake up from.One of the most fascinating aspects of Sinners is how strongly it echoes the mood and psychological depth of Midnight Mass. Both works dissect religious devotion, sin, and the lies people tell themselves in the name of righteousness. In Sinners, the town itself feels alive, like a character weighed down by its own sins, much like Crockett Island in Midnight Mass. The sense of isolation, the slow building dread, the powerful and melancholic soundtrack - all of it mirrors the same masterful control of atmosphere Mike Flanagan is famous for.It's honestly strange that more people aren't talking about these similarities yet. Sinners doesn't rely on cheap scares or over-the-top horror - it relies on creeping unease, on tension that tightens with every whispered prayer and every dark secret revealed. And when it finally explodes, the payoff is terrifying and deeply emotional.For those who appreciate horror that respects intelligence and demands patience, Sinners is a hidden gem. It's a beautifully crafted, emotionally heavy story about guilt, redemption, and the monsters we create out of fear and faith. It left me shaken - and thinking about it long after it ended.Rating: 9/10."

The expectations of what type of genre it was. Every character has his or her own style of personality. Twin brothers opening their own night club. Now I did not expect this movie to get so strange, the timeline of the early 30's and mixed in with the 90's. The music and soundtrack was pure perfection. All the characters were phenomenal. The twist and story were just as satisfying as it can be. Overall very enjoyable for a Ryan Coogler film."

Also, why the vampires have rules to be invited first bwfore attacking. The ending with the sun burning everyone was also very typical. It would be more wow to have a different way of extinguishing them. But overall, I enjoyed the movie."

          "content": "Sinners is the greatest movie of this year and feels fresh like something we haven't seen in cinemas in over a decade. Its genre-blending tones is one of the great features this movie has to offer. The acting is incredible. Michael B. Jordan steals the show so much they gave him two characters to play. Jordan shined, but every other actor and actress in this movie had amazing talent and it made every character appear fully fleshed out. The dialogue is also great, giving a line like \"before the sun went down I would say that was the best day of my life.\" Or something similar. The setting and background presented is beautiful and covers a period and place in time we don't see often. The setting is so great that you forget the point of the film and get lost in the characters and their lives. The transition from act one to act two is a little awkward but works out overtime. The vampires are some of the coolest depictions of vampires in any media. I loved the trope of having to invite them in. It felt a little overused but the mind games and dilemmas that happened from it were perfect. I found the most gut wrenching moment to be when the man who they thought was dead gets killed because his death is the only one in the movie that is completely unfair. It felt sickening to watch but the intensity in this movie is so quick that there is hardly time to get a reaction. That was one of the weakest parts in my opinion was how the directors decided to shift the focus away from characters dying and continue in. That can work sometimes, but the characters in this all had so much depth that I wanted a moment to feel sad. This movie also does great with jumpscares. The opening scene is so unexpected and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The singing, songs, and music were also great. One thing I must've missed was a reason the vampires were there because I got lost a little bit. Sinners could be called a predictable movie, but it doesn't matter because it's about what things look like as they play out. I can hardly find ways to hate this movie and that's why I'd give it a 9.5/10 or IMDb rounded to 10/10. Go watch this movie while it's hot if you haven't already."

It feels a bit far from any reality we've been presented with in history books or other movies. When it pivots to vampires it's a hard pivot, and then it gets simultaneously more engaging...but also kind of ridiculous. There is a sequence that revolves around the need for vampires to be invited into a place that is basically dumb. The only thing standing between the good and bad is an invite? Meanwhile I felt like surely this doesnt hinge on something this small from vampire lore. It feels thin. Other parts of the movie focus on men performing oral sex on women. Or black men? Either way, we were scratching our heads about why is this a theme of the movie. The treatment of Native American and Asian characters was interesting but felt very aspirational and non-historical. Again-fine either way but just more semi-relevant stuff added to a movie already over-stuffed with ideas that dont feel important (raised and go nowhere).The last I will say is that the early movie and then heavily the last 20min feel like a Hallmark card. The emotions are a bit maudlin, and there are multiple montages of dead characters that we are meant to mourn and remember. Why treat the audience like children that way? Directors dont need to re-signify which acts were brutal or which characters we should feel sad about. Honestly, the last bit before the credits sequence was painful. I felt like I was being told how to feel. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."

The vampire plot is obviously what draws the most attention, but I want to highlight Ryan Cogler's cinematography. He's truly a genius at his craft, and it's when he's away from Marvel blockbusters or Rocky/Creed that he shines the most. He shares these characteristics with Jordan Peele, delivering a scathing social critique based on race, and this is no exception.In the end, and after all, we have several plot twists and post-credits scenes that, far from detracting, actually add considerably to the content of this work.That said, after seeing the film, you have to let it settle before commenting on it. I have the feeling that a first viewing can't fully assess everything.As I said, I don't know if it's overrated or a masterpiece. I just know that I really liked it and appreciate a certain originality in cinema these days."

If you're a fan of Ryan Coogler then you will not be disappointed. I only hope this movie gets the love and praise it deserves. Looking at you Oscars."

Goes in a direction you'd never expect if you don't know what to look for. Michael B Jordan was incredible playing both roles in the movie, all the other actors were phenomenal and of course the main theme song is by my favorite Jerry Cantrell from Alice In Chains\nHow can you go wrong with that\nA few explicit scenes, nothing shown but maybe if you have young kids be aware of that coming. All in all it's the best movie I've seen in many years. Loved it."

I won't spoil anything but the story follows two brothers, Smoke, and Stack (played by Michael B Jordan) who used to work for Al Capone and they come back to their home town to open a Juke Joint. It takes place in the 1932 and everything about it screams 30s. The outfits, set design, guns, the way they talk, everything! They killed it! Within the first 15 minutes you will already be immersed in this world. I don't want to give anymore of the plot away so you can experience it blind like I did. First things first, DO NOT expect a horror movie. Because it isn't... at all. It takes almost half the movie before the \"horror\" aspects are even in the movie. Calling Sinners a horror movie is like saying pulp fiction is a comedy. Does it have horror elements? Yes. Does it have creepy scenes? Also yes. But that's not the point of the movie. It's not meant to scare you, it's meant to wrap you into this beautiful world Coogler created and make you feel like you're living through the characters. It's hard to get into what made this movie so brilliant without spoilers so I'll leave it at that. Please just watch the movie. If you're on the fence, don't be! You won't regret it."

This movie had so many amazing moments, a movie that is filled with lore accurate vampires and Stella characters and performances are the stand out for me. Miles is an incredible actor and deserves to be nominated for an Oscar award. Michael B Jordan did an amazing job portraying twins in this movie and the uniqueness of this movie making music the centre and cause of the issues that unfold is brilliant. Cultural references of black culture, music, period era/Jim Crow era. This movie is an absolute masterpiece and I can't wait for more movies outside marvel that Ryan Coogler has stored for us."

          "content": "Probably the best movie of 2025 so far. And if a better horror movie comes out this year, I'd be surprised. Most of the other praise here worth giving will probably sound like hyperbole, but whatever. Ryan Coogler is yet to miss as a filmmaker, and him and Michael B. Jordan as a director/actor duo is on track to be on the level of Scorsese + De Niro (if they make a handful more excellent films together at least). And Coogler makes up for Jordan only being in his last film briefly by having him play the two lead roles here. Jordan playing off himself is so seamlessly done.Sinners does interesting new things with familiar horror tropes. It really takes its time, and the slowness of the first half might be the only thing that feels like it could be a flaw. Well, that or Sinners biting off a lot for one film to handle. But the slower scenes I feel will be easier to appreciate on a rewatch, and if I need a second watch to digest everything that's being gone for here narratively and thematically, then I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. That I want to see it again at some point in the not too distant future is praise in itself.As a horror movie, it's eerie in the same way that listening to those old Robert Johnson recordings (also from the 1930s) are eerie. Sinners is such a beautiful and atmospheric film. It wasn't a cheap film by any means, but looks as though it could've cost twice as much as it actually did. They shoot the money and I love it when a film does that. And the music here is phenomenal. It's an early front runner for Best Original Score, though it might be disqualified if lots of the music is repurposed older stuff. Still, the way it uses music is excellent, and music in general is so important to so much of the film.I mostly loved this movie, and feel it'll be even better a second time around. I think all the hype around this one is justified."

The accents are laid on so thick by actors who (obviously) are modern people who have (obviously) never heard a 1930's southern accent, for an audience who have (obviously) also never heard a 1930's accent. It may be difficult to get them sounding realistic while still completely decipherable, but at least a good start would be to limit the amount of dialogue that's drowned out by the (rather good) soundtrack. Or maybe the theater I was in just had really bad sound mixing."

Ryan Coogler brings the same kind of sharp, character-driven storytelling he's known for, but here he twists it into something dark, violent, and deeply emotional.Michael B. Jordan absolutely dominates in a dual role, pulling off two very different sides of the same mythos. He's magnetic-whether he's brooding in silence or exploding with rage, you can't look away. The supporting cast is strong across the board too, with a few standout performances that really flesh out this brutal underground world.Visually, the film is stunning. Gritty cityscapes, shadowy interiors, flashes of surreal horror-it all feels carefully crafted without being overly slick. The action scenes are intense and raw, not flashy for the sake of it. Every fight, every confrontation feels personal and desperate.The story deals with themes like redemption, power, and identity, but it never gets bogged down in heavy-handed metaphors. It lets the characters live and breathe inside this dark, violent reality. And yeah, there are some big, emotional swings in the second half that absolutely landed for me.If you're expecting pure horror, this might throw you a little-it's as much a crime saga and character drama as it is a horror film. But that's honestly what makes it stand out. Sinners feels alive, dangerous, and full of heart.Coogler once again proves he's one of the most exciting directors working today. Highly recommend this one, even if you think you're burnt out on vampires. This feels like something new."

The plot follows two wealthy and influential African American men who return to their hometown with the dream of opening a blues bar, recruiting staff, and launching their business. Along the way, a talented African American blues guitarist gradually undergoes an awakening and, despite the advice of family and friends, ultimately achieves his dream.The scene composition is meticulously crafted, immersing viewers in the smoky, rugged streets of the nostalgic early 20th century. The actors' performances are exceptional, rarely pulling the audience out of the experience. They skillfully convey deep emotions, such as the complex love-hate dynamics between former lovers, the arrogance of returning home, and the facade of bravado.However, there are a few elements that feel out of place. First, the music in several vampire scenes is overly intense and rock-oriented, which clashes with the emotional tone and doesn't fit the vampire theme. Additionally, the prominence of horror, fighting, and vampires is an issue. Regardless of whether the vampire metaphor is appropriate, the excessive amount of vampire, horror, and action scenes severely detracts from the space for the audience to reflect on the deeper themes, making the film lose focus.In conclusion, this is a film with a deeply thought-out concept, but with serious flaws in execution. It is recommended only for horror movie enthusiasts or those who want to see a very masculine lead character."

From the lighting, the music, the artistic direction, to the symbolism - everything was done with precision and heart. The actors didn't just act; they lived their roles.Michael B. Jordan might just be the Denzel Washington of our generation - and Sinners shows he's getting closer to that level.Even though it was a vampire movie, the action felt unique. Black culture was mixed with fantasy in one of the most beautiful ways I've seen. Through the symbolism, you could also feel parts of Indian and Western cultures, all tied together with a strong spiritual undertone.Sinners weaves culture, fantasy, and raw emotion into a story that stays with you.The music had a huge role in the film. In the tavern scene - almost like a semi-musical - multiple genres were blended into one powerful montage. The artistic side wasn't just shown through the soundtrack, but also through the colors, the production, and the atmosphere. Everything felt alive.If it were up to me, I would've replaced the vampires with more witchcraft and voodoo elements, to make it even more real and grounded. But at the end of the day, it didn't matter. The message still hit perfectly. Maybe the vampires were just a crazy, creative touch added to give even more to the audience.Sinners reminds you why you fell in love with cinema in the first place."

Jordan and Hailee Steinfeld.First off, the costumes, sets, musical score, and cinematography are absolutely incredible. The amount of detail put into this film is amazing. It's definitely worth seeing in theaters if you can.The story follows two siblings who return to their hometown after spending a few months robbing and stealing from other towns. They're back to open a juke club, and for opening night, they pull out all the stops by recruiting a handful of talented musicians.However, later that night, a vampire visits the club, intent on taking the soul of their cousin - who happens to be the best blues musician in town. From that point on, chaos erupts, and the siblings must fight for their lives.When I first saw the trailer, I was hoping the movie would revolve around musicians selling their souls to a dark demon or getting caught up in some kind of witchcraft. I was thinking of Robert Johnson, the legendary blues artist who, according to folklore, sold his soul to the devil - and who famously died at 27, becoming the first member of the so-called \"27 Club.\"\nNonetheless, Sinners delivers a highly original story and a screenplay that's absolutely worth experiencing."

          "content": "What makes Sinners particularly a good movie is that it takes its time with the story, and never gets over-the-top with the horror. It stays restrained to a cultural horror flick. What makes this movie different is that the period culture (1932 Mississippi) is its own story.If you're scared of the dark, this movie is not \"too bad\" as the genre goes. Maybe a 5 out of 10 for scary. It's not the scary that makes the movie so good, it's the entire story presentation. The period culture and the antagonists feed upon each other, in a good way. (Yeah, I know.)Also, just a note that the story begins at a point that allows for prequel(s). There are certain initial facts that \"just are\" but we don't know how they got there. That is, there's a backstory about a lot of people and situations that could not be explained in time permitted. Again, this is not a negative, actually it was well-done, and keeps the context alive. (Yeah,...)Generally, in a Dusk To Dawnish framework, the first half is much of a period piece, and it is not politically correct or constrained like a Disney flick. It does what it means to do. It doesn't care if different races are sitting next to each other in the theater, with (Whites Only) bathroom labels.Two twin brothers (Jordon) come back to town with some money (non-backstory) and want to do some business with a music club. But when you're too good with the music, you bridge time and space and dimensions and open doors, perhaps the wrong ones, and the concept is really well expressed by excellent direction.Some \"infected\" people want to come into the music joint to have some \"dinner,\" and the whole thing goes awry. There's not really nonsense comic relief, but the story does not tension it that way to need it. The fight ball rolls down the middle.This is a great movie for a date night out. It's an interesting story, it's not over the top horror, and just enough mystery, music, sex. Etc....This was well-written and well-directed. Great period costumes and culture. Depending upon the competition, it could even win an Oscar for set or direction, which would be unusual for the genre, but it was very well expressed.This is what I would call a carefully disciplined expression. It does not stray around. It tells the story it wants to tell without ever exceeding its space. A well done implementation.The rating is a solid 8, perhaps even getting to an 8.5. For me, when you start getting to 9s and 10s, you need to be getting to masterpiece range, and usually with some philosophically deep meaning or life-lesson. This is not getting there on that general movie basis for me. However, for people who might constrain the review standards differently (including the novel use of the wonderful culture of MI in 1932), I would not dispute them on justifying a higher rating.This movie is a great movie to get people back to the movies on a date night out. That's a wonderful thing for the society and the industry."

It was transcendent and cathartic, especially the musical numbers. Yes, it bends and combines genres - it is part historical fiction, part crime action thriller, with the gothic-horror aspects merely icing in what can be described, among many interpretations, as a story of infiltrated communities who end up turning on itself. We could not stop talking about it on our way home.Part I: Music makes the MovieMusic is a core component of the story. The film opens to a narration on how certain individuals, whose music is so true, can conjure spirits from the past and the future. One such gifted musician is Sammie, played by newcomer Miles Caton. Among the musical numbers, there are a couple who stood out. One is where Sammie, after a beautiful narrative build up, finally gets to perform a blues masterpiece. The opening narration repeats and a surreal single shot take happens - one that viewers describe as the best cinematic sequence in years! An ethereal, out of body type scene! To experience it in theaters is one of the film's gifts.And while we thought nothing can top this, the vampires surprisingly brought their own songs. And I have to admit, while Sammie's performance is powerful, the vampires' rendition of \"Rocky Road to Dublin\" was playing on repeat in my head even after the credits. It helped that Director Ryan Coogler tapped longtime collaborator and 2-time Oscar Winner, Ludwig Göransson for the score. And they spared no expense to get the musical talents for their ensemble, even Lars Ulrich from Metallica is credited. The narrative set up, of course, helped elevate the performances, but then again, the Music made the movie.Part II: Historical Fiction and the Smokestack TwinsMichael B. Jordan, in likely his most difficult role yet, plays identical twins Smoke and Stack. They are World War I Vets who worked for gangsters in Chicago, until they decided to return home. The Twins buy a sawmill from racist landowner Hogwood, with the intent of turning it into a Juke Joint for the local black community. Along the way, they recruit their cousin Sammie, much to the opposition of his pastor-father who think blues music is of the devil - a representation of conservative Christian beliefs of the time.The first half of the film feels like a tour into a local town in 1932 South America, as the twins recruit staff for the joint, including Smoke's estranged wife Annie. Stack also runs into his old flame, Mary (Hailee Steinfield). Both couples' interactions give us a quick background into their relationship - Annie is an occult practitioner who insists her voodoo amulets and trinkets protected the twins, while Smoke bitterly reminds her that it didn't protect their daughter. Meanwhile, Stack insists on getting rid of Mary because she passes as White, and intermingling is considered dangerous practice in this time period.What we love about the movie is its \"show, don't tell\" philosophy, trusting the audience to be familiar or smart enough to figure out the various norms of its time from context clues. The twins having Irish beer and Italian wine, which Mary deduces as ill-gotten, allude to them stealing it from the Prohibition era gangsters of the time who were primarily Irish-American and Italian-American. Among their recruits are The Chows, a couple that seemingly represents the Asian store owner stereotype, but Chinese immigrants have been present in these communities since the Reconstruction period (1865-1877). The rampant Jim Crow era segregation laws also force them to own adjacent stores that cater to Blacks and Whites separately - which is inspired by the real-life Gow and Min Sang Convenient stores of the 1920s.The use of color is noteworthy. Smoke and Stack are differentiated not just from body language but blue and red accents respectively. Sammie wears yellow, which means the 3 of them are the \"primary\" protagonists. Their respective partners also share their color scheme, with the exception of Mary, who wears light pink. A representative of her struggles to be accepted by Stack but she's eventually drenched in blood-red after turning into a vampire.Part III: The Undead are Allegory for OppressionRemmick deserves to be in the villain hall of fame. He enters the film sunburnt fleeing from Choctaw Native American Vampire hunters, seeking refuge at a local white couple's home. Noticing they are members of the KKK, Remmick utilizes their prejudice to antagonize his pursuers, gaining sympathy so he could be invited inside. He then violently turns both of them into vampire thralls. The film could've easily simplified this as a black community getting attacked by white vampires and the social allegory is there, but the film takes it a step further by making Remmick an Irish immigrant who mentions how Christians \"took his father's land\" - making him thousands of years old. His pursuit of Sammie's gift is a tragic desire to reunite with his ancestors.Knowing oppression himself, Remmick persuades everyone in the juke joint that assimilation brings unity and freedom from bigotry, describing the thralls he made as family. He warned that he looked into the memories of the Klansman thralls, and reveal Hogwood to be a KKK Grand dragon who'll be leading a lynch mob against the juke joint in the morning. He offers to eradicate Hogwood in principle, but despite these well-intentioned desires, his \"free\" community is a hive mind, and he threatens their loved ones to get what he wants. He even utilizes the same racism and oppression to manipulate humans to his cause. His plea and equally powerful song numbers are a metaphor of the commonalities of African American and Irish Americans in social status and standing in the 19th century. But his vampirism is a nod to how the Irish seized the opportunity to assimilate with their oppressors while African Americans continued to face prejudice and violence, sometimes even at the hands of the Irish.Part IV: Freedom and SalvationThe night's bloodbath was followed up by Hogwood's attack at dawn. Smoke was able to defeat them with the element of surprise but at grave cost. Sammie, bloodied and grief stricken, returns to his father's church. His father pleads him to renounce music but it only parallelled Remmick's forceful indoctrination leading Sammie to leave.Sinners had by far the most creative transition towards a mid-credit scene which also showcased the film's true ending. It was a profound reunion between the turned-Stack and Mary with Sammie, who's now a celebrated blue's musician. Sammie claims that fateful night still haunts him, but before the sun went down, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack agrees, noting it was the last time he saw Smoke, the last time he saw the sun, and the only time he ever felt free. The primary protagonist's endings have contrasting versions of freedom and salvation, Sammie through music, Smoke through death, and Stack, though \"alive\", wealthy and with the love of his life, is living through eternal darkness.I believe I've only pierced the surface of its many details and interpretations. Meanwhile, people still continue to find hidden meaning through its dialogue and presentation weeks after its release. Sinners is a masterpiece, and will be talked about for years to come."

Seeing so many different cultures mix, especially from old traditions to new pop culture, was such an eye-opening feeling. It really captured the energy of a world on the cusp of transformation - one foot in history, one foot in the future. I absolutely loved Grace's character and her role during a time when Jim Crow laws existed. It really made me consider the experiences of other minorities during a racist era, not just African Americans but immigrants and other marginalized groups as well. Her presence added a rich layer to the story that felt powerful and overdue.The soundtrack deserves a special mention: a rich mix of gospel, Delta blues, and eerie spirituals that feel woven into the very soul of the film. The music doesn't just complement the story - it tells part of it, giving voice to what the characters sometimes can't say out loud."

Beautifully demonstrates how the KKK never left the south, how trauma surfaces in the black community long after slavery, picking cotton and sharecropping for wooden nickels, barely being able to have fun on your days off, and how music, in this case, the blues brought a community together through pain and troubled times. And then, there's vampires? It almost comes along as a means to bring a lightened disassociation to a reality white people refuse to accept. The idea that unity can only come through death and rebirth, but is an endless perpetual cycle. There was an abundance of different ways to detail this, and to choose one as cheap and silly as vampires is beyond me."

The aspect ratio switch-ups really elevated the whole experience. The use of music in this film is just phenomenal by Ludwig Göransson. There are a lot of obvious metaphors and direct addressing with the vampires, Christianity, and the KKK, etc. But I liked a few things that were not immediately obvious to me. How the Irish were considered lower class than other white people, and why the Vampire is Irish, and how that is able to specifically address cultural assimilation vs appropriation.There are aspects of the supernatural lore that I have doubts about, literal doubts and doubts on the effectiveness of some of the choices with respect to how the politics is represented through that. I also wanted to see the end of some of the threads they started. The lines about Christianity and black people were so true, and I wanted them to show more of it at the end, which they didn't, but they're already getting slack from angry Christians, I guess they didn't want to go overboard with it.The best part of the movie is definitely that musical portion blending into fantasy, which was so good that the final showdown, the last thirty minutes, didn't really live up to the potential of the movie. Both cinematically and thematically, it was a bit jumbled. The problems are more noticeable looking back at the movie because otherwise the movie was so damn good.Despite all the nitpicks, it's easily the best movie of the year for me.Anyone who can, go watch it in the biggest IMAX screens because it is so worth it."

          "content": "*Minor spoilers*I must preface this review by stating two things:1. I am not black\n2. I love going to the movies but with what passes for entertainment these days it takes a lot to get my butt in a seat.So having said that, I will not deny, I bought into the hype machine. This was a film that when first seeing trailers I had zero interest in seeing it. It wasn't until the rapturous reception and audience scores that I thought maybe I had misjudged and my initial gut reaction was wrong. This film only solidified the old adage \"go with your gut\" - I nearly fell asleep twice and couldn't wait for it to end. To my shock the audience was actually clapping and gave the film a standing ovation at the end. Mind boggling to say the least.The film does not lack for ideas or talent in front of or behind the camera, however, it tries to be too many things at once and never fully coalesces. It's not at all scary, surprising or all that engaging. There's no big twists, or reveals or even memorable action set pieces. The villain is about as sinister as a glass of milk. The vampire lore, abilities etc are barely explored. The deaths completely fall flat, you don't fear for or feel sad for a single victim. The actual action (when it does FINALLY arrive) is entirely underwhelming and over before you have time to check your watch.The music is very effective at times, and at others just distracting and goofy. One particular sequence that people seem to be salivating over involves imagery of black music and its influence on culture over the years and includes a George Clinton stand in that kinda looks like macho man randy in blackface. Although an imaginative sequence, within the context of the film it's just cringey and indulgent. Speaking of indulgent - there is no way way this movie needed to be two and a half hours long.It is nice to see a somewhat original film put up some numbers, but by original I simply mean not a remake or a superhero movie or some existing IP. This film is original in that regard but hardly original in the inspiration and sources it cribs from - most notably Tarantino (dusk till dawn, Django, even shades of inglorious bastards). I can imagine if I were an aspiring black artist I would love this film and feel that it were made for me, and I suspect its success (both critical and audience wise) is very contingent on the fact that it's a black story. However, that doesn't automatically make it great. If this were the same movie but starring white people it would hardly be doing this kind of business. 98% rotten tomatoes score is mind blowing, this is a mid to high 60s rating easily. I suspect critics are too afraid to be harsh on it though, perhaps fearing some backlash.Again - there is a lot to admire and I do believe Coogler is a talented filmmaker who will go on to make even better films, but if you're on the fence and not quite buying the fabricated hype, I would wait for streaming so you don't have disappointment as I did."

Before I get into that, I have praise and critiques of the film at face value.First, the first hour and a half should've been cut down dramatically. The film has too much unneeded information and the inability to push forward efficiently. This is Hollywood's biggest technical flaw and its a symptom of bad writing.That being said, this had the bones of a good movie, and there is probably 30 minutes of high quality entertainment. The vampires are eerie, the brothers' journey to open the bar kept my interest, and the coming of age for Sam seemed like it would pay off. Plus some of the secondary characters like Cornbread and Delta Slim had fun colorful personalities.The film did fall short in its climax. Once it was time for the all out brawl, where the humans were outnumbered at least 3 to 1 by the superpowered vampires, the fight was a basic melee and the humans seemed evenly matched. It just wasn't as spectacular or as clever as I was expecting.After the big fight, the movie should've been over; and at that time I thought to myself \"that movie was alright.\" But boy oh boy, that last major scene... all skepticism I had lingering in my head about the philosophy of the story teller exploded to the forefront and stained my opinion of the movie.It's very obvious the movie is purposely exclusionary to white people, and easily argueable it vilifies them.I get it's set in the 1930's, but if every movie I see for several years slaps me across the face with messaging that vilifies who I am, and this one happens to just gun me down between the lines, I'm sorry I don't take your movie at face value.So now I'm left sitting here thinking about this wildly successful movie and I'm wondering, \"Does everyone understand that black people hate us?\", \"Is this acceptable?\", \"Am I overly intertwined in the culture war?\", \"No, it's the children who are wrong!.\"Whether I'm over-thinking the movie or not, we're praising movies on a curve at this point in movie history. Anything new that is better than mediocre gets treated like a masterpiece and this is one of those movies."

Jordan playing twin brothers was laughably horrible. There was barely any real differentiation between the two characters, making it feel like you were just watching the same guy awkwardly switch personas. The CGI used to \"split\" him into two was equally horrendous, distracting from any emotional impact those scenes were supposed to have.The overall plotline was confusing to follow, riddled with unnecessary subplots that led nowhere and characters that felt half-developed at best. Also, I'm definitely not a fan of the cheap jump scare scenes they threw in, which felt forced and out of place, as if they were trying too hard to create tension instead of letting the story build it naturally.That being said, the music scenes were easily the best parts of the movie. They had a certain raw energy and authenticity that stood out from the rest of the mess. It's a shame the rest of Sinners couldn't match that same level of passion and execution."

Honestly, it's not that scary for me compared to what I expected - the horror elements are more on the mild side if you're someone who watches a lot of scary movies. But even with that, I have to say, the film is very good. It's the atmosphere, the storytelling, and the performances that really shine here rather than relying on cheap jumpscares.The characters are really interesting and actually feel real, not like the usual horror movie stereotypes. The story keeps you hooked from start to finish, with a lot of mystery and tension that slowly builds up rather than hitting you all at once. Even though the scares were lighter for me personally, the creepiness and suspense were handled extremely well. It's the kind of movie that sticks with you because of its mood and emotions rather than shocking you with loud noises.The cinematography was beautiful too, adding to the eerie vibe without making it overwhelming. The setting was perfect, giving that lonely, haunting feeling that keeps you curious and unsettled. I loved how Sinners focused more on storytelling and emotional tension rather than just being \"scary\" for the sake of it.If you're looking for a well-crafted thriller/horror with great characters, a chilling atmosphere, and a thoughtful plot, Sinners is 100% worth watching. It's not the scariest movie out there, but it's definitely one of the most enjoyable horror experiences I've had lately.10/10 without hesitation!"

I am ready to go to the theater to watch it a second time. Please ask the director and Michael B to make more original movies like this. We Asian audiences love it! We are also trying hard to encourage our friends to go to the cinema to watch this movie! Come on! The best movie with full marks! (Taiwanese audience)"

          "content": "From looking at the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, I was expecting The Movers: Sinners to be something truly amazing, a movie that would live up to all the hype and glowing reviews. Unfortunately, it really fell short of my expectations. The storyline felt underdeveloped, and there was a serious lack of background explaining where the devils actually came from and how they ended up in the story's world. This made it really hard for viewers like me to stay fully engaged or even understand what was going on most of the time. There were so many unanswered questions, and it felt like the film just assumed we would already know all this information without actually showing it to us. On top of that, the pacing was a major issue - the movie felt unnecessarily stretched out, dragging in parts where it should have been moving quickly and building tension. Overall, it left me feeling disappointed, confused, and wishing they had put more effort into fleshing out the story rather than just relying on its dark aesthetic to carry the film."

Yes that's right in less then a week I watched the movie three times at the cinema.Ryan Coogler knows how to write characters and he knows how to write them well. There are so many layers to not just the main characters like the twins and their younger cousin but also the secondary characters and of course the villain. This isn't just a horrorfilm, it's a story first and a horror second. The movies villain is also not just some horror movie monster but a metaphor for something much greater and has many layers.The music is also just so good, it elevates every scene. I haven't been able to stop listening to the soundtrack since I first watched the movie.This movie is definitely my new favourite of all time!"

The hype is the one that ruined it for me because their was so much hype around it you were expecting to see something groundbreaking instead you are left with a poor dusk till dawn rip off. These directors need to stop being lazy and make something completely fresh with a decent storyline for a change."

The music throughout the film is fantastic and deserves special mention, it's surprising that it wasn't marketed as a musical (tho understandable), because the many musical scenes are some of the highlights. The songs are truly memorable and add so much depth to the atmosphere and characters.The plot and cast are incredibly interesting. I loved how the Vampires were portrayed with a very modern twist in their appearance, while still respecting and using the old classic clichés when it came to fighting them. It was a wonderful balance between fresh ideas and nostalgic traditions.The villain, Remmick, was fascinating, and I especially loved the duality shown through the hive mind concept connected to the vampires. What stood out the most was that the Vampires didn't come across as inherently evil. Remmick's ideology was sadly comprehensible and, at times, even sympathetic, which made the story all the more compelling, due to the modern time parallels. .I enjoyed every single second of this movie and honestly wish I could experience it for the first time again. Sinners is a heartwarming, heartbreaking, scary, interesting, and sexy story, all wrapped into one. A truly unforgettable experience.The political message of togetherness, and the experience of excluded groups was truly beautiful and moving, and I hope we can see many more movies created by Black content creators."

          "content": "\"Sinners\" is a 2025 drama-thriller directed by Ryan Coogler, starring the likes of MBJ, Hailee Steinfeld, and Hollywood newcomer Miles Caton. Set in 1932 prohibition, Jim Crow Mississippi, Sinners continues the trend of genre-bending, mixing so many genres into one movie you can't quite put a label on it. It's a deep-dive, humanist character(s) study.. no, wait! It's a theatrical music video, now, hold up... I see vampires..?I spent a good portion of this movie sorta misinterpreting the message. There's themes of morality and racism, and in the background the lasting institutional suffocation of slavery is evident. Sinners shows that music represents a people, a canvas of sonic expression so vibrant and powerful it instantly leads to the debauchery of lust, greed, and gluttony. This is captured in our vampiric antagonists, who are a physical manifestation of these sins. I also originally looped the racial element of generational trauma into these demons.The Juke Joint is essentially a haven of black expression in a time and society that seeks to erase that culture. You step outside, you're discriminated through multiple avenues of attack, institutionally to pick cotton as a living, legally through Jim Crow, or mortally in Klan lynchings. It's the secular, daily-life parallel of something like a Beloved, Toni Morrison's psychoanalytic trauma of a mother haunted by the ghost of her daughter she killed to spare her from the horrors of slavery. It's a sense of no escape that is thought to be temporarily censured, until once again the predator breaks through to turn every innocent music-loving soul into a violated, sin-loving inhuman.Vampires are the generational trauma, an enforcer of institutional distress that flaunts debauchery as an additional campaign of violence unto an already-marginalized people. It's why the twins' mantra to preacher boy to not choose their life holds so significant, an exit in spiritual purity versus their lives of sin and pleasure is more valuable than preacher boy could ever know. The idea of vampires as a vessel for generational trauma is profoundly unique.But why I retract the generational trauma statement is that in truth, historical racism and morality reside independently within Sinners, not interwoven. There really is no intentional message of escaping generational trauma necessarily, and rather focuses on the celebration and expression of black culture, of music, and how giving into sin can lead to immense pleasure captured in music evoking an artistry of life so beautiful yet nevertheless developed by means without scruples, which comes back to bite them... literally.Sinners is a whole lot of something, but if it's not generational trauma, then what is the central message?It can't be a simple 'do not sin', but perhaps for a movie about pleasure, a state of being in which you simply just enjoy, the message is to simply do just that. And we have plenty in the movie to do so. Omnipresent music that transcends the past, present, and future, followed by a concert of exactly that interweaving African folk music, blues, rock and roll, with a kick of hip hop in the \"Magic What We Do (Surreal Montage)\" extravaganza captures the opening lines so perfectly that what is there to think or do than just sit back and enjoy it? This is the essence of pleasure, pleasure in motion masterfully written by Ludwig Göransson (no further elaboration necessary).The tropes of siege warfare and 'assembling the team' were also executed perfectly, and the wistfulness of past romances reignited was a deliberate addition of depth to these characters. It's crazy how Coogler integrated everything in just 2 1/4 hours - never felt fast-paced at all.8/10."

One of the amazing elements is the dialogue s, emotional, and revealing. Without a single flashback, the script manages to give you a deep understanding of each character's past.The acting is top tier. Every cast member brings raw emotion and intensity to their roles, creating an immersive experience that resonates long after the credits roll. Coogler's direction is confident and precise every creative choice, from pacing to character arcs, feels intentional and impactful. Add to that some truly stunning cinematography, and you've got a film that's visually and emotionally powerful.The story is compelling for the most part, though the antagonist felt a little underdeveloped. While he brought a sense of danger, he lacked the emotional complexity that the rest of the film delivered so well. Additionally, a supporting character likely Sam's girlfriend felt unnecessary and didn't contribute much to the overall narrative.That said, Sinners is easily Coogler's best work. It's bold, beautifully made, and emotionally charged. GO WATCH IT !!!!!!!"

Incredibly well acted from everyone with either: comedy, horror or action with plenty of character interaction and discussion to sink your teeth into.Additionally, the music was incredibly well done, conveying plenty and truly drawing you into the scenes (a nice mix of past and future genres will probably be the highlight for most people).It isn't perfect however, none of the below are deal-breakers, but they did bug me.Firstly, I felt the climax was a little rushed. The film does a phenomenal job setting up all the characters and tension of the situation, but it all feels like it's resolved too easily and too quickly to really be satisfying (the reason why the vampires get in makes complete sense, so there isn't an issue there). Additionally, I feel like they turned too many people for the big action scene to really be realistic. I know it's a vampire film, so realism is always tenuous, but when there are 30 vampires involved and limited ammunition in a massive open room I just struggle to believe they weren't all taken out immediately.Secondly, the mid-credits scene felt unnecessary, almost marvelesque. It was nice to get some closure, but it really felt like a sequel tease for a film that would have stood better on it.s own.Finally, some of the melodrama boardered a bit too close to cheesy in my opinion. The one that stuck in my mind was Smoke telling Mary he loved her.Overall though, this one is well worth a watch. Nice to see vampires regaining a bit of pip culture cool in recent years!!!"

However, there were a lot of little issues and questions plot-wise that keep me from actually seeing this as a \"great\" we'll be talking about forever. This movie felt like 2 movies put into one. There's one plot line about music, culture, and blackness rooted in a cool history, and then there's... vampires? The tie-in between music/ evil and vampires missed the mark for me. Who was our villain and what was his motive? Why did he care about our main characters so much? The ending didn't make much sense either: if his music really calls to all evil, how and why does he go on after like nothing happened? Was this supposed to be a cautionary tale, if so, what was the warning? What was the point of the movie by the end? What was the message or point besides vibes? No moral of the story from what I could find. When the \"two\" stories collided, the whole strength just kinda fell apart. Still cool. Maybe if the concept of vampires had been introduced sooner beyond a vague statement about evil that had nothing to do with vampires. Anyway, still enjoyed it, and still loved \"the scene\" a LOT."

          "content": "I'll do this in \"the good\" \"the bad\" and \"the ugly\" format. I'll follow that with my take on which typea of people will like Sinners at the end.The Good:The cinematography, the sound, even the focus pulling was all amazing. I don't think I've ever stopped to notice focus until I saw a movie that was damn near perfect with the focus, then I noticed it. The director of photography is a standout. The acting and the creative blending of music and storytelling and the ability for the movie to touch on social issues but let the movie still be a movie. The twins (both MBJ) interact with each other a lot in a really technically challenging sort of way which is impressive.The Bad: It was both too long and too short at the same time. While some of the music driven scenes dragged on a bit too long, my ability to feel like i really knew the characters was cut short. I think 2hr 15min was too long and it should have been 2hr flat. In that 2 hours more time should have been spent on the characters and less on the music. The music was great just too much run time spent on it.It's not really scary. The horror is cool and fun but there's no moments of terror or even hair standing up on the back of your neck. The closest sense of real forboding probably comes during the irish dance scene, interestingly enough.The ugly: While the twin scenes were impressive... Stack is very much a different tone of color, lighting and haze. It looks weird. One way they addressed this was they pretty much always make him look that way so even when he's alone he still looks that way, but they forgot to do it in one or two shots which made it weird again. Not a big deal but enough that I noticed it.The spit scene: *spoilers?* this could be character development, maybe the 2 are super freaks and thats one of the reasons they love each other but anyone i know that likes spit in their mouth its usually toward the highest state of arousal not at the immmediate start but I guess one could argue they do. Also... the spit is digustingly thick and gloopy and just...Bleghk *shrugs*The gore: It's... not very impressive. They definitely should have had more skilled people involved on the horror special effects and have paid closer attention to the coloring because there's a scene where the blood looks like a mixed berry smoothy and not like blood.Overall while definitely not perfect I really liked it at a lot. My favorite horror movies are from Mike Flanagan so I tend to like movies that are more about the emotion and the characters than the scares. It's like the horror setting is the best setting for discussions on abuse. I feel like if Ryan Coogler continues with horror he might end up being the next Mike Flanagan which means fans of that type of horror won't have to completely dread Mike Flanagan's retirement. Personally... I liked Oculus better than this movie but I don't think that means Sinners should be a lower rating it means Oculus should be higher.Sinners in IMAX was amazing. I'm not sure why I've never been that into IMAX in the past but the movies I've seen there just didn't add enough to the movie experience to warrant the extra travel time to get to one. This movie? Absolutely worth it, so much better. Maybe not all IMAX movies are shot on film? Maybe digital doesn't add much when scaled up? I have no clue but when my girlfriend and I decided we liked it so much and wanted to see it again we were both like it has to be in imax the second time, too.So, are you going to like it? Here's my best guess based on my just-made-up-now \"Mike Flanagan/Jordan Peele Likability Chart\"If you like both Jordan Peele AND Mike Flanagan: YES you'll love it a lot I think. If you only Mike Flanagan and not Jordan Peele: Probably going to like it... especially if you like blues music. Only Jordan Peele: YES. What if yoi don't like either of them? Well... probably not going to like :-( unless a huge blues fan. If you're a horror fan who only watches horror for the gore? No. Very Grossed out by mucus and spit? Oh you might want to close your eyes for maybe ten minutes or so in the movie about half way through.Hope this review helps."

Even an interesting concept with the vampires and the power of music And even for the last three minutes of final wrap up I still loved the film. But there's about 20 minutes in there between the great beginning and the decent end. Which I guess was meant to be the whole pinnacle of the film that was utter chaos, had no purpose and played out like a B grade movie. Which is genuinely unfortunate because it could've gone down as one of the greatest films of the year. And they obviously were leaning towards a sequel, but no need to see that sequel if they're gonna play it out the same way."

However, despite the above average direction and compelling performances, it's clear that Ryan Coogler's ongoing tendency toward very subtle political messaging, frequently framed around a \"white people bad\" narrative, this time hidden beneath the mask of \"historical accuracy\", is once again genuinely frightening critics from criticizing the greedy writing of this film."

A lot of time is just spent in the build up, and the main sequence is a let down.The primary thought going through my head was - we are all so used to ordinary everything these days, that anything above mediocre is hailed as extraordinary.If a good period film about Black History needs to be seen, then Django Unchained is a solid winner and would score a 9 on 10. Sinners is a decent 6."

So perhaps that's the bigger reason I didn't like it as much as other people. I do like thrillers and don't dislike horror because of the dark or scary nature of the content like some people. I just don't find horror stories very interesting or scary most of the time and don't think scaring the audience should be the point of a movie even if it absolutely can/should be the effect at times if it supports a good script. Often with horror, it doesn't.The actors did a fine job. The cinematography was solid. The music fit the crazy style of the film that I didn't exactly like. But I don't blame the composer for that. The film has some stuff to appreciate. But I'd prefer some rewrites of the first 75% of the narrative."

Jordan) are notorious twin brothers who left Mississippi to work for Al Capone in Chicago. They returned in 1932 with a violent background and a desire to open a juke joint for African Americans in an old sawmill they purchased from the local head of the Ku Klux Klan (David Maldonado). Smoke and Stack encounter their cousin, Sammie Moore (Miles Caton/Buddy Guy), a blues musician, much to the dismay of Sammie's preacher father (Saul Williams). Smoke, Stack, and Sammie also have love interests--mystical and occult believer Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), mixed-race Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), and singer Pearline (Jayme Lawson). The first vampire we meet is Remmick (Jack O'Connell).I've read some attempts at explaining the symbolism in \"Sinners,\" but I think they try too hard. The church and Annie are both bulwarks against the evil vampire and the Ku Klux Klan's efforts to destroy the African American community drawn to the opening night of Club Juke. Both sides try to control the blues but fail at enormous cost.The vampire scenes are graphic but not sensational. I'm not a vampire movie fan, but the blues music made it a good experience. The storyline of the first hour reminded me of \"The Color Purple,\" but it became something else when the vampires arrived and began to attack. Then, it was evil against a remnant of the righteous. The Buddy Guy epilogue is a nice ending."

There was some weird oral fetish going on in the film that did not add but instead subtracted, and was distasteful, no pun intended. The movie dragged in the middle and fell short (sloppy) in the third act. The writing struggled. This film is getting a lot of acclaim, but I cannot agree.The positives: the story was not heavy-handed or overtly didactic, and there were a few nice touches at the end, but the touches seemed a bit afterthought-ish.Acting ~ ⭐ 8/10\nThe acting was above average. Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo did a great job, the latter being the standout. There were no weak performances, but there was nothing incredible either. The acting was the film's greatest strength.Cinematography ~ ⭐ 7.5/10\nPretty, but not exceptional. These guys must be getting bonus points for shooting in IMAX. It was good, but not great. A couple of pretty landscapes and a cool oner in the dance scene.Recommendation: Watch it if you like horror, but it's not necessary to see it in theaters. The theatrical experience didn't wow me. This film is getting a lot of press, but after the hoopla, the ratings will settle on average ~ in the low sevens, which is not bad; that's my opinion, with it and five bucks, you can get yourself a coffee."

But there's a sting a lack of something hidden that it is almost seems like Ryan Coogler is afraid to go to the extra mile in scarying it's audience as if he was afraid to add gore a scared scenes he plays it safe. Sinners is not much of a horror film more of a thriller with less frightening scene and not much of gore is a vampire love story that celebrates black culture all in its own. The film is not for everybody but it was definitely was for someone and that someone was for the black folks that's exactly what Ryan Coogler did in this film he told a unique genuine story with an original concept that work really well in a safeside."

Unfortunately, it doesn't make for a satisfying and engrossing movie. He tries to patch in his favorite themes of slavery, exploitation, racial violence, evil white people, freedom and whatnot. But these ideas seem tacked on to a thin story. In fact, the story is the weakest link in the movie, which is saved primarily by its music (esp that party scene where past and present musicians come together). The basic premise of the twins coming to their town and setting up a juke joint which gets attacked by vampires is all but told in the trailer itself. This means that when you watch the movie there's very little left to reveal further. The first half is brothers putting together a team and setting up the joint, the second is it getting attacked by vampires, followed by a battle. As you can tell, there isn't a third act or anything more to hold your interest or surprise you. In fact, after a point the whole \"battle\" sequence and drawn out death scenes felt a little naive. There's a final shootout scene with some white (Klan) folks but by then you couldn't care less about the goings on. The end credit scene feels like a desperate attempt to bring some gravitas into the movie with a line about freedom, but its too little too late and too tacked on. The movie doesn't quite encompass the poignancy it keeps hoping to grab. The actors are better than the characters written for them. The central character of Sammie works as a musician but not as a son breaking free of shackles and following his passion. Coogler really needs to get out of his own head and reassess his themes, stories and ways of telling them. While Sinners excels in music and technical departments, what it desperately needed was far better writing and storytelling. Sinners had the ideas, audacity, and the potential of being an all time classic, but what it actually is a overhyped movie that will be remembered for some great musical sequences and a tired vampire angle in a toothless second half."

I found it admirable that the director who grew to prominence through remakes and franchises went out on a limb to make something \"original\" - unfortunately once you make your way through the entire film, you realize there's barely a lick of creativity or inspiration throughout the entire thing.I've also always been fond of Michael B. Jordan, but here he puts in hands down the worst performance I have ever seen by him. There was absolutely NO REASON for him to play twins, or for twins to even exist in the movie, as both of them have identical personalities (and entirely uninteresting ones, at that) - there is only ONE scene in the entire movie that utilizes the twins even existing, and it's completely pointless. The way Jordan rides an uneven line between old-timey and his modern rizz might work if the movie were meant to be thoroughly campy, but it's not. And that's actually the biggest problem with the entire movie. It takes itself WAY too seriously. In order to have a movie that takes itself this seriously be effective, you need locked-in directing, writing, editing, and acting - unfortunately NONE of these elements excelled in this film. They were all floating around 6-out-of-10 level quality, perhaps lower when it comes to directing and editing. While some of the side characters had really strong performances and presence (Miles Caton, Delroy Lindo, Jayme Lawson), a majority of the cast brought \"TV soap opera\", but with a more disjointed flow. On the subject of flow, the pacing was the worst part of the entire movie. Just about every scene could have benefitted from serious cutting. I was telling myself the slow pace in the first half would certainly be for a reason, as I felt sure the second half would flip it and deliver intensity, but once I got to the second half, I just couldn't wait for it to end, because it kept getting worse.I've seen people compare this to From Dusk Till Dawn and I have to say that is such an insult to From Dusk Till Dawn. For one, that movie intended to be fun action schlock, and it is from top to bottom. This movie, on the other hand, makes you sit through nearly a full hour and a half of stale poor man's drama, only to turn into a derivative vampire action film in the final act, and once you get there, all of a sudden the first two-thirds feel like they actually served no purpose at all. On occasion, SINNERS attempts satire, and in one scene only, surrealism that comes out of nowhere and feels completely out of place, and in all of these attempts it falls entirely flat.Somehow, nearly all of the aesthetics and concepts in SINNERS feel so novelty that they feel like masks to cover up how uninspired and vapid the movie actually is. There's really not a single worthwhile or rewarding element to SINNERS that I can think of - I guess there was some pretty nice looking photography during the finale, but Nosferatu did it far better a few months ago and even that was a disappointing film in the big picture. I feel that I have once again been duped by planted hype through marketing ploys that only the richest of the rich can afford - I have no doubt that the team behind Black Panther, one of the most successful movies of the last decade, could attain whatever kind of reviews they want with the right amount of money. But, this movie was AN ABSOLUTE YAWN FEST - the worst movie I have seen in the theater in quite a while."

The atmosphere is tense, the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, and the acting is top-tier - especially from the lead, who absolutely owns every scene.What sets Sinners apart is its originality. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or recycled horror tropes. Instead, it builds dread with purpose, weaving in deeper themes of guilt, morality, and the darkness people try to hide. It's smart, brutal, and terrifying - the kind of film that stays with you, makes you double-check your locks at night, and has you recommending it to every horror fan you know.If you're craving something truly unsettling, beautifully crafted, and genuinely scary, Sinners is a must-watch. Absolute 5 stars."

Every scene feels important, and the pacing is just right-not too slow, not too fast. What I really liked is how each character actually feels like they matter. No one's just standing around to fill space; everyone has a purpose and adds something to the story. The atmosphere is dark, moody, and honestly kind of beautiful. Visually, it's stunning. And don't even get me started on the music-it's perfect. The soundtrack adds this gothic, emotional layer that makes everything feel deeper and more intense. It's one of those films where the sound and visuals just work so well together. If you're even slightly into vampire movies, this one should be on your list. It nails the vibe, the story, and the style. Honestly, it might be one of the best in the genre."

          "content": "Sinners 2025 is a brooding, genre bending thriller that balances gritty crime drama with supernatural overtones, all anchored by a powerhouse dual performance from Michael B. Jordan. Directed by Ryan Coogler, the film explores themes of brotherhood, guilt, and fate through the story of twin brothers Smoke and Stack Moore two men forever connected, yet haunted by radically different choices.Smoke Moore is a street hardened enforcer with blood on his hands and a chip on his shoulder. Stack, on the other hand, is a quiet, reclusive former preacher battling demons of his own both literal and figurative. When a violent act from their past resurfaces, the brothers are forced to confront not only each other but the darkness that binds them.Coogler once again proves his strength in character driven storytelling, using the film's urban decay and shadowy atmosphere to mirror the emotional weight the Moore twins carry. The cinematography is sharp and stylish, blending harsh realism with moments of eerie stillness that hint at something otherworldly beneath the surface.Jordan is the heartbeat of the film, crafting two fully realized characters who are distinctly different but clearly born of the same pain. His portrayal of Smoke is intense and volatile, while his performance as Stack is subdued, full of quiet regret. Watching them interact is a testament to his range and Coogler's careful direction.While the plot occasionally wanders and some of the supernatural elements feel underexplored, the emotional core never loses focus. Sinners asks tough questions: Can people truly change? Are we bound by the past, or can we rewrite it?Sinners isn't just a crime story, it's a moody meditation on duality, destiny, and the cost of trying to escape who you were born to be. With Michael B. Jordan delivering two of his best performances yet, and Coogler guiding the story with soul and style, it's a film that lingers long after the credits roll."

          "content": "Sinners - the latest film from Ryan Coogler - has been dominating the box office and receiving widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences. Coogler once again proves he's a visionary filmmaker, this time taking on a vampire story - but not in any way you'd expect.The film brilliantly blends genres and themes: it's part Prohibition-era nightclub drama, part vampire thriller, and part cultural exploration. It celebrates blues and bluegrass music while using the vampire mythos as a metaphor to delve into deeper issues - particularly race, assimilation, and identity in America. The metaphor is rich and layered, exploring what it means to be forced to integrate into a society that doesn't fully accept you.Despite juggling so many elements, Sinners pulls it all off with remarkable ease. It's dense but never dull - thrilling, bloody, sexy, and thought-provoking all at once. The production design is stunning, with every frame dripping in atmosphere. Some sequences, especially the musical interludes, feel like bold creative swings that shouldn't work - but they absolutely do. One in particular, a mid-film celebration of music, stands out as a jaw-dropping moment that elevates the entire experience.What's most exciting about Sinners is how refreshing it feels. It's not a remake, not a sequel, not another franchise entry - it's a bold, original work that reminds you of what cinema can do. It entertains, challenges, and exhilarates. It's a movie that reignites your love for movies."

Even though I had heard a lot about what some of the themes of this film were, you don't really feel their impact until you watch them on the big screen. The dance sequence has was great. To incorporate all of those music genres into one sequence brings the true story to light. It is interesting how tremendous passion for something lends itself to writers molding that passion into an addiction that leads to a persons' undoing. Music and writing have been used in this way in many a movie. This movie elevates this connection ad makes it gorgeous. Coodles to Coogler."

In December, you could name a genre and ask what the top movie of the year was and it's not a bad guess to say Sinners might be on that list. It does everything well. My only gripe is the movie kinda rushes the villain's introduction and I wouldn't have minded if the movie was 5-10 minutes longer to spend more time on the main villain and the Choctaw characters. Still feels too good to give less than a 10. So many iconic shots, sequences, music, lines, set pieces. Watched it in theatres with my girlfriend and we both loved it!!!"

It shouldn't just be background dressing. It should be brought to the forefront. It should drive the story. It should be a character in itself. It should give you goosebumps in the big moments. Sinners is one of the best examples of this.Aside from the music, I could tell I was watching high-quality filmmaking within five minutes. The directing, camerawork, editing, and sound design are pristine. The entire cast does a great job, but Michael B. Jordan shines. He is a superstar.Sinners is also surprisingly funny, without taking away from the seriousness. And the horror elements are... satisfying. This movie goes hard.Advice: Certain scenes have an expanded aspect ratio that will only be shown in IMAX. If you can't go to an IMAX, any premium screen will do (Dolby Cinema, UltraScreen, EMX, etc). This movie benefits more than most from the larger screen and louder speakers.Also, I missed A LOT of the dialogue, you may want to ask for a closed caption device."

The Depression, former gangsters, racism, etc. It just not seem to fit together.If you want to see a much better recent vampire movie, stream Nosferatu on Peacock.

From impeccable costume design and a perfectly curated color palette to the richly detailed set pieces, the film transports you completely. But where it truly shines is in its character writing. Every character feels grounded and believable, with motivations and choices that make sense within the world they inhabit. Even with limited screen time, the film introduces characters you genuinely care about and want to root for.ACTING\nThis is easily one of Michael B. Jordan's best performances to date. He masterfully convinces the audience they're watching two different actors portray the twins. Miles Caton, as Sammie Moore, delivers a standout performance as well-his presence is undeniable, and I'm excited to see the opportunities that come his way.CRITICISM\nMy only critique-and I'm sure I won't be the only one to feel this way-is that the vampire aspect of the story didn't quite land. With the richly developed world and the compelling characters Ryan Coogler brought to life, the supernatural twist felt out of place. I was completely immersed until that point. In fact, I found myself wishing we could see this same cast and setting explored in a different context, which speaks volumes about the strength of the character writing."

Only thing that follows outside waiting for them to leave is a group of vampires.It has a great cast ensemble and amazing performances.The music score is great. The cinematography is also wonderful. The script writing and direction is great. First hour is a build up with meeting characters. Connecting with old flings and old love interests. After a vampire leader played by Jack O Connell shows up. It's when things gets kicked into high gear as it is a fight for survival.

Humor was sprinkled throughout, but it was definitely a fantasy movie thru and thru. I think the fantasy aspect of it, took away from its deeper themes and made it a two \"faced\" vibe. The horror aspect of it was more action comedy than horror, the human aspect of it touched on universal themes although in idealized overly stylish fantasy ways, the fantasy of it took away from the seriousness of what the director was trying to get across. Sometimes bordering on ridiculous-like some of the behaviors characters chose were extremely 2025, sometimes touching on universal themes of human experience but rarely deeply the style, heavy handedness and pacing took away from the depth possible. The music was the star and was the message. Overall it covered lots of well trodden ground in a in your face/ears way, like if marvel and blade had a baby and it was asmr in reverse.

Since covid it seemed like Hollywood writers devolved into unimaginative 12 yr old boys. However, it is halleluiah time! An incredibly unique screenplay with the guts to include the deep south blues music, culture of that time and vampires! Crazy. Yes, it did remind me of the \"Dusk till Dawn\" movie. Which was an excellent thriller until it suddenly and shockingly changed into a gory vampire movie. \"Sinners\" is so much more. First a few critiques...The scene with the three vampires playing the banjo and singing was too corny. Was Coogler trying to win a diversity award? He included the Choctaw Indians chasing the head vampire for about four minutes then they ran away and were never seen or heard of again! Unnecessary and awkward. The incredible magical dance scene with the ancestors and descendants should have stopped when the roof exploded with fire. By drawing the camera back to a distance, it made the scene look too realistic and fake. Last one.. no back story on the Irish vampire. I felt the casting for him was not the best choice. However, the rest of the cast was awesome. The editing was superlative. Just give the editors an Oscar right now! The set design was perfect. Direction, writing, production, acting, pacing all superior. The musical scenes were awe-inspiring. I keep replaying them in my head. I have been researching some masters of the blues like, Robert Johson, Buddy Guy, etc. Having Buddy Guy in the final scene was genius. STAY IN THE THEATER UNTIL AFTER THE CREDITS."

Ryan Coogler takes a deep breath of Southern heat, guilt, and folklore, then exhales a film that feels like a sermon, a séance, and a spiritual reckoning all at once. It's rich in texture, myth, and meaning, but it never loses its emotional pulse under all the cinematic muscle.Michael B. Jordan delivers twin performances that feel like shadowboxing with fate - it's not a gimmick, it's generational tension made flesh. Miles Caton stuns in his debut, and Hailee Steinfeld radiates strength in a role that knows when to shimmer and when to sting. And then there's Ludwig Göransson's score: part gospel, part graveyard, part vinyl crackle magic. It doesn't just accompany the film - it possesses it.Shot on IMAX 15-perf 70mm and Ultra Panavision 70mm (yes, that's film), the movie looks like it was printed on the soul. Every frame feels haunted, every cut feels earned, and the whole thing moves with the rhythm of stories passed down through smoke, scars, and song.Coogler's best? Maybe. Cinema's most spiritual moment of the year? Absolutely."

          "content": "Sinner is a surprisingly solid film that manages to hold your attention even if it doesn't fully blow you away. The story is cohesive and well-paced, with enough intrigue to keep you invested. While the plot doesn't reinvent the genre or take major risks, it shows a clear sense of direction and purpose, which is refreshing in a time when so many films feel overly ambitious or scattered.The performances are grounded and believable, especially from the lead, who brings quiet intensity to the role. The cinematography is clean and effective, and the tone stays consistent throughout. There's a certain simplicity to Sinner that works in its favor-it doesn't try to be more than what it is.That being said, the film doesn't leave a lasting emotional impact. It lacks a bit of punch in the final act and plays things a little too safe to be truly memorable. But for what it is, Sinner delivers a decent, well-made experience. If you go in with measured expectations, you'll likely walk away satisfied.A solid 6 out of 10."

The pacing is a little slow, and the film doesn't really grab you until the back half when the tension finally ramps up.The hive-mind vampire angle was different and had potential, but at times, it felt like I'd seen this movie before-just with a slight twist. The climax, featuring a drawn-out shootout, didn't quite land for me; it felt unnecessary and took away from the more intriguing psychological and horror elements.Still, Sinners delivers enough atmosphere and originality in its best moments to make it worth a watch, just don't expect anything groundbreaking."

The plot is incoherent, and there's absolutely no logical connection between the scenes. It feels like the filmmakers had random ideas and stitched them together without any effort to create a meaningful story. The characters are poorly developed, the acting is dull and lifeless, and the dialogue is painfully forced. Visually, it looks cheap, and the pacing drags endlessly. If stupidity had a leaderboard, this movie would be number one. It's not just a waste of time and money - it's an insult to the audience's intelligence. Watching it feels like being punished for no reason. Do yourself a favor and skip this film completely."

          "content": "The more I think about Sinners, the angrier I get. I went into this movie with zero knowledge of what the film was about and zero expectations and somehow still left disappointed.The first half of this movie had me fully hooked. From the soundtrack to the world building I thought it did a great job of setting up a perfect time period piece that would explore the history of blues music in Mississippi and the misfortunes that African Americans of that time had to endure, boy was I extremely wrong.Instead of offering its themes in a creative nuanced way, it shoves the same themes down your throat the whole movie offering little to no critical analysis. Ultimately this is my biggest gripe, it almost feels as if the director believes his audience has an elementary school level grasp of its themes and consistently needs to preach to its audience what's good and what's bad. The most compelling character(s) in the movie is the smoke stack twins, however with such little to work with script wise Michael B. Jordan's motivations for his character ultimately fall flat for me.The jarring introduction of \"horror\" aspects, if you can even call them that, completely took me out of the movie and made it seem like every scene up until the vampires was completely pointless. Almost every character you spent the whole movie getting to know their motivations is killed off within the span of 20 minutes by nonsensical creatures. After watching this movie and seeing it listed under the horror genre, I was truly baffled. Unless my mind is serving me wrong, outside of a jumpscare within the first 5 minutes of the movie, and the sloppy gorefest of an ending there is not a SINGLE aspect of horror in this movie. It's almost as if the director couldn't pick a genre so he decided to throw basic tropes and cliches against the wall hoping something would stick.I would have loved to see this movie ground its self in real world history and treat its audience with the respect that we deserve. But unfortunately like most movies of today, the director treats its audience like little kids who have no understanding of how society works. I do believe that deep down there is an amazing movie here, however you have to dig through too much slop in order to appreciate the actual message. Wait until this comes out on streaming if you have any inclination to see it. Save your time and money."

What I will say is that the film has a great soundtrack with some nice old jazz and the acting is quite good. My only complaints are minor...it's NOT a film for kids or families due to the violence level and sexuality in the movie..though because it's rated R, you'd have an idiot to show it to small kids!

          "content": "The trailer for this upcoming movie was played several times when I went to the cinema, it was when I read more about it I discovered it was a scary-themed movie, I was hoping all the hype would be justified, written and directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed, Black Panther). Basically, set in 1932, identical twin brothers and World War I veterans Elijah \"Smoke\" Moore and Elias \"Stack\" Moore (Michael B. Jordan, in dual roles) return to Clarksdale, Mississippi after years spent working in Chicago for Al Capone. Using money stolen from gangsters, they buy a sawmill from racist landowner Hogwood (David Maldonado) to open a juke joint for the local black community. Their cousin Sammie \"Preacher Boy\" (introducing singer Miles Caton), an aspiring guitarist, joins them despite objection from his pastor father Jedidiah (Saul Williams), who warns that blues music is supernatural. The twins recruit other staff: pianist Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) and singer Pearline (Jayme Lawson), who Sammie is attracted to, as performers, Smoke's estranged wife Annie (Wunmi Mosaku) as the cook, local Chinese shopkeepers Grace (Li Jun Li) and Bo (Yao) as suppliers, and field worker Cornbread (Omar Benson Miller) as bouncer. Meanwhile, Stack reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), who is mixed race but appears white. Mary resents Stack for abandoning her when he left for Chicago. Annie has a belief in the occult, insisting her practices kept the twins safe; this causes Smoke and Annie to argue as he bitterly reminds her that their infant daughter still died. Elsewhere, Irish-immigrant Remmick (Jack O'Connell) has fled from Choctaw, escaping vampire hunters, revealing himself to a married Klansmen couple and turning them. On the opening night of the juke joint, Sammie's music impresses and entrances the crowd, and he unknowingly summons spirits of both past and future who join the dancing. Remmick and his minions are drawn to the performance and offer money and music to enter the joint. Suspicious, the twins hesitate to allow them to enter, and the trio walk away. Mary reminds the twins that the bar needs the income, she goes outside to talk to Remmick and is turned. After stepping outside to urinate, Cornbread is attacked and turned by Remmick as well. Mary returns inside, where she seduces Stack and bites him. Smoke shoots her, but she is unharmed by the bullets, and she escapes Stack bleeds to death. The shooting and bloodshed cause the joint patrons to flee, and the vampires attack and turn all those outside, including Bo. Cornbread returns to the door, but they realise he cannot enter as he could before, and he retreats. Stack revives as a vampire, but Annie repels him with pickled garlic juice. Annie educates the survivors that vampires cannot enter a building unless invited and they can only be killed by silver, wooden stakes, and sunlight. Remmick leads the larger horde of vampires and tries to cut a deal with the survivors. He praises Sammie's musical skills and wants to claim his supernatural talent. He claims vampirism offers immortality, freedom, and escape from racism, and wants to summon the spirits of his lost community. Remmick also warns the survivors inside that Hogwood is the head of the local Ku Klux Klan, and plans to attack the bar at dawn. When the survivors refuse his offer, Remmick and Bo threaten to turn Grace's daughter Lisa (Helena Hu). She dares the horde to attack the joint, inviting them in. In the ensuing battle, Grace, Annie, and Delta Slim are killed. Mary is devastated by Annie's death and flees the bar. Smoke, Sammie, and Pearline try to escape, but Remmick and Stack ambush them. Smoke and Stack clash in a brutal fight, while Sammie and Pearline go against Remmick. Pearline is bitten and begs Sammie to flee. In a final confrontation, Sammie smashes his guitar over Remmick's head before Smoke arrives just in time to kill him with a stake. The vampire horde is incinerated as the sun rises. Urging Sammie to flee, Smoke ambushes and kills Hogwood and the Klan but is mortally wounded. Before dying, he has a vision of Annie and their daughter. A badly beaten and grief-stricken Sammie returns to his father's church. Jedidiah pleads with him to renounce music and seek salvation but Sammie refuses, taking his guitar with him. Sixty years later, an elderly Sammie (Buddy Guy) has become a celebrated blues musician in Chicago. He is visited by an ageless Stack and Mary; Stack reveals that he was spared by Smoke at the joint all those years ago, allowing him to go free under the condition that Sammie would be unharmed. The couple offer to give Sammie immortality, but he declines. After performing for the couple, Sammie tells them that although he is still haunted by that fateful night, it was the greatest day of his life. Stack agrees, as it was the last time he Smoke watched sunlight, and the only time he ever truly felt free. Also starring Lola Kirke as Joan, Peter Dreimanis as Bert, Andrene Ward-Hammond as Ruthie, Nathaniel Arcand as vampire hunter Chayton, and Tenaj L. Jackson as Beatrice, Cornbread's pregnant wife. Jordan as both bootlegging brothers is terrific, Caton in his debut acting role does well as the talented cousin, Steinfeld has her moments, and O'Connell is alright as the silver-tongued leading villain. The 1930s setting and themes of racism add to the atmosphere, the recognisable rules of vampires work well, it is gnarly and violent at the right times, and the southern American blues music featured is catchy, I just wish it was scarier and it was weird at times, a worthwhile enough period supernatural horror. Good!"

Right away, I have to mention that the film's music is both soulful and sinister, setting the tone perfectly. Experiencing it, I immediately felt connected to the characters and the themes the movie was striving to portray.The cinematography, paired with Göransson's breathtaking score, is truly mesmerizing. The cast delivers performances that absolutely deserve recognition.The concept of blending music-especially Blues-with vampires is genuinely novel, and Coogler's execution is a testament to his mastery of the craft. What could have easily felt silly instead enhances the atmosphere of racial tension and horror, making the film all the more immersive. Yet, it also finds room for well-placed comedic moments, which adds a smart contrast to its darker themes.That said, Jordan's performance as the Twins fell short for me. It lacked originality and often veered into caricature, feeling more like an exaggerated depiction of the era's archetypes rather than a sincere, nuanced portrayal."

          "content": "Director and writer Ryan Coogler shared that some of his most vivid cinematic memories come from watching horror films in theaters as a young man - experiences that sparked his deep love for cinema. According to him, \"Sinners\" is a kind of love letter to that feeling, crafted with the hope that viewers in theaters will experience the same thrill. And honestly? Mission accomplished.\"Sinners\" is one of those films best experienced with as little prior knowledge as possible - we strongly recommend not reading anything, not watching trailers, and avoiding all conversations about it beforehand if you can. The film's plot flows with organic ease, taking unexpected and refreshing turns that hit especially well if you go in spoiler-free. So we'll steer clear of plot details here, too.The initial inspiration behind the film came from Coogler's connection to his late uncle, James, who had a deep interest in music and history, particularly in the Mississippi blues tradition. James's stories and musical tastes left a lasting impression on Coogler and sparked the creative process that ultimately became this film. As you might guess, \"Sinners\"is at its core a musical film. Not in the sense of a musical or a movie with original songs woven in like \"Django Unchained\" - rather, music is part of \"Sinners\"' DNA. It's interwoven into the story, the characters, and the entire atmosphere, offering a unique lens on the culture, folklore, traditions, and struggles of the Black community in 1930s Mississippi."

          "content": "Sinners starts unnecessarily with an opening scene, then going back to the day before. Why? This is a trope that rarely works, and it doesn't work here since it serves no purpose other than spoiling something. From there on, it is very good, but sputters into terrible territory over the course of two plus hours. It's all because the script has scenes that happen, but offers no answers to hundreds of questions that a thinking person has.What we know is that two brothers have either fled or left the Al Capone gang to start a juke joint business or one-night party in their home town in Mississippi. They decide to, all in one day for no reason, purchase a venue, pay someone to make a sign, find a musician, find a chef, and find patrons. Why this is all done in one day is a giant flaw that could've been handled in an interesting way. Over an hour later we get our first appearance of the Irish vampire who drops into frame in the middle of the day in the middle of nowhere. The reason this happens would be good to know, but is not mentioned. The rest of the film introduce scenes that start off great, but then make no sense. A great example of this is the large song sequence. The movie has an attempt at a theme of the love and appreciation of blues music. A musical number starts and rather than the characters experiencing this theme, it's just for the audience to see the past history of music and future. The future \"glorification\" of music, doesn't tie in with the characters and serves only to confuse the viewer. There's a vision of the barn burning down that the vampires see, but this doesn't tie into the story like it is set up to. Ultimately the vampires would rather sing and dance than really try to infiltrate the party, thus the only real vampire action happens in one scene that has no direction. Vampires and humans entangle in a stupid fight that just happens without suspense or believability.I could literally post a few hundred questions that highlight all the issues. Why were the guns not in the juke joint? Why did the vampires prance around until daylight? Why involve the KKK in such a shallow way? Why even have vampires? Why did a character slice his arms open to attract vampires that were already coming for him, and why did he act so stupidly (along with the girl) when it came to the garlic eating scene? I will reach a character limit on this review of if I keep going. Ultimately, the characters had no sense of end goals and any attempt at themes are never gone beyond a slight mention. Yes, it's well made for the most part when it comes to acting and cinematography, even though some scenes are lit terribly and cgi stands out in scenes where it shouldn't, but the script is one of the worst of the year. It fails as a film that wants you to think and also fails at something that could've been a turn your brain off popcorn flick."

Rather than leaning on the usual blood-soaked tropes, Coogler roots his narrative in the rich, interwoven histories of African American, Chinese, and Choctaw communities in the Mississippi Delta. The result is a story that explores the real horrors of humanity-greed, betrayal, power-and poses the timeless question: what would you sacrifice to live forever?What sets Sinners apart is its invocation of ancestral legacy, not as background color, but as a living, breathing force driving the plot. The allegories run deep, offering commentary on survival, memory, and the burden of history, all while building a universe that feels lived-in and infinitely expandable. Coogler has laid the foundation for something bigger, and if this is the first chapter, I can't wait to see where the Ryan Coogler Cinematic Universe goes next."

          "content": "# \"Sinners\" (2025): A Masterpiece of Symbolism and MetaphorIn the realm of cinematic symbolism, few films have captivated me as deeply as Guillermo del Toro's \"Pan's Labyrinth\" did years ago. That was, until I experienced \"Sinners\" (2025). This extraordinary new film has not only matched del Toro's masterpiece but has surpassed it in its layered storytelling and profound metaphorical richness.## A Tapestry of Meaning\"Sinners\" weaves an intricate narrative that operates on multiple levels simultaneously. At its surface, we follow a compelling story, but beneath that lies a complex examination of human nature, societal structures, and the cyclical nature of evil. Every scene, every interaction, even the background elements carry symbolic weight that rewards attentive viewing.The film brilliantly explores how different forms of temptation and attachment cloud our judgment, making us incapable of ethical clarity when most needed. It doesn't merely present these themes-it embodies them through its visual language and character arcs.## Beyond Racism: Economic Forces and False UnityWhile \"Sinners\" tackles racism head-on, it expands beyond this singular issue to examine how economic interests can create superficial alliances between groups with fundamentally opposed values. The film offers a scathing critique of how corporate interests and financial incentives can mask deeper divisions while creating an illusion of progress and unity.## The Instruments of EvilOne of the film's most powerful metaphors centers around the guitar that once belonged to the antagonist's uncle. When music emanates from this instrument, evil from the past resurfaces in the present-a chilling reminder that the vehicles of cultural transmission can preserve both beauty and horror.This metaphor extends brilliantly to other instruments of cultural power: education, technology (even AI), and art itself. \"Sinners\" suggests that these tools possess dual potentials-they can liberate and enlighten, but they can also oppress and destroy when wielded with malice or indifference.## Destiny and OriginsThe film's exploration of identity and heritage is particularly moving. Characters struggle with the tension between predetermined paths and self-determination, between escaping one's roots and inevitably returning to them. This cyclical journey creates some of the most poignant moments in the film, as we witness characters fighting against their circumstances only to discover that true growth comes not from escape but from reconciliation with one's origins.## The Power of Shared MemoryThe climactic sequence where the protagonist sings a significant song demonstrates how shared cultural memories can bridge seemingly insurmountable divides. This moment of connection, juxtaposed against the earlier \"garlic trick\" (a brilliant reference to suspicion and trust-testing), creates a powerful emotional resolution that feels both earned and profound.## Conclusion\"Sinners\" is a remarkable achievement in metaphorical storytelling. Its ability to operate simultaneously on multiple thematic levels-personal identity, systemic oppression, historical trauma, and the possibility of reconciliation-makes it not just entertaining but genuinely important. Like the best symbolic works, it doesn't merely present its ideas-it invites viewers to discover them, creating a deeply personal viewing experience.For those who treasured \"Pan's Labyrinth\" for its symbolic depth, \"Sinners\" offers an even richer tapestry of meaning-one that will undoubtedly reward multiple viewings and establish itself as a new benchmark for metaphorical filmmaking."

Usually when both scores are high that means something good. It also has done well in the box office. I am very disappointed. This movie was poorly written. The story is simple enough but even the name of the movie doesn't really match the film. The acting and cast was fine but I was almost never immersed. I was patient with the film but an hour in they were still just preparing for the party. I waited another hour before the story began! This literally could have been cut down to an hour and a half and it should have been. There were a few musical scenes that I enjoyed but otherwise it was just terrible. I was thinking I'd give this a 6 but with all the talent and money put into this I can't. I really don't understand how people can praise this film. Im mystified. What a let down, Bummer."

Jordan this was an amazing surprise.The plot is very satisfying very easy to follow and the setting of the movie is amazing , they got the accents right and the whole vibe just feels right , it definitley feels well done in terms of characters and styling and all of those sort of things.Michael B. Jordan's Acting Performance was amazing as Smoke , he was amazing , his leadershiping character was phinominal , the first act of the movie was very cool also but without Michael B jordan's acting it will be nothing.What surprised me is How the movie just Shifts the vibe so Smoothly , building up the suspence with the amazing soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson his soundtrack and the way it slowly and smoothly upped the ante was amazing, The film reminded me of \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" for how it shifts the vibe mid film and also reminds me of \"The Thing\" for how they try to prove that they are not vampires.Overall A good movie and possibly one of the best films to come out this year! 8/10."

Jordan in double role, return to their home town after spending some time working inside the Chicago Mafia to use their savings to open an entertainment casino like business. The problem is that music seems to attract an ancient evil almost nobody was aware that is lurking around.Great cinematography, excellent sound track, remarkable acting and an ending that freezes you in your chair in an IMAX theatre.

The plot beats are very similar and the way the story unfolds also very reminiscent of FDTD. Although that does NOT mean it's a copy or rip off in any way. I would call it a respectful homage and companion piece. Watch them back to back. It just work. Sinners has enough fresh ideas to make it work on its own. The movie is a lot of fun. The music stands out significantly as a highlight to this theatrical journey. My only gripe is that the movie seemed a little bit too dark at times. It was hard to make out what was happening on screen occasionally. But overall it was a powerhouse of a time with excellent performances, effects, and action. Michael B. Jordan pulled double duty and absolutely owned this role. I really liked this film. I recommend checking it out for anyone a fan of Quentin Tarantino films, 90's vampire films, and/or period crim/dramas."

Although the plot is passable, the characters-particularly the outstanding guitarist-and the gorgeous, multi-genre visuals are the true highlights. The movies soundtracks are one of the best I have heard and it combines all the genres in the film. Although the film struggles with ambiguous themes and direction, the pacing remains consistent. Nudity and excessive sexual content felt superfluous and detracted from the whole experience. Sinners receives a 7.9/10, for a horror film its the best I have seen, even as a movie its pretty solid."

          "content": "Gone are the era of mediocre horror, well not quite. We still get a lot of mass produced low budget, low effort horror, but the next generation of horror has a lot of small people with gigantic ideas and concepts and that leads to a hit like Sinners. This was phenomenal to watch on the big screen and it has some of my favourite scenes and music in recent memory of a movie. It isn't to me a huge life changing movie for me personally and it has some basicness to it that comes with the vampire territory but that doesn't make it any less fun and amazing.Two brothers return to their black community with a huge amount of money ready to create something for that community with a juke house. But sadly the opening night is being taken over by a thread larger than them.The score and soundtrack in this movie is absolutely amazing! Me and my wife was alone in the cinema and we were jamming hard to the score. Bopping along and awing constantly over it. The blues guitar and sinning is the name of the game and it is the soul of this movie. It sounds absolutely incredible. Ludwig Goransson is slowly becoming the composer of the new decade and this is also another crowning achievement for him. Not only is the score and sinning incredible, but is also weaved into the plot and themes with the Irish folk singing and also the juxtaposition to the \"white music\" contra \"black\". It is a score with a soul and identity not something we see a lot.This is also a masterclass in creating loveably characters and shows you, you don´t need a lot of screentime to really make characters you care about. A few interactions done and written right and you have a cast you care about and you don´t need to wave your arms a lot to do it. This movie is incredible at that. This is elevated by incredible performances all around. Jack O´Connell, giving camp and intimidating, Miles Caton, creating a sympathetic singer that looks up to the mains, Delroy Lindo having so much fun as Delta Slim. But the main man Micheal B. Jordan giving a powerhouse performance playing both leads as Smoke and Stack. Such a wide range, making me believe in two different characters played by the same man. So incredible talent to let me believe they are on screen together. Incredible range from smooth talking stack to emotionless but scared Smoke to later camp action. An absolute masterclass in acting.First Nosferatu(2024) and now this. Vampires are back and that is awesome! I love the vampire mythos and this is a good one of that. Classic vampires and lore that works well here for the plot. It´s not really about vampires per say but it ties into the overall themes of the movie so well. Themes about community and what it really means work well with the villains presented.Because the themes are what I love about this movie. First and foremost community. It´s about what it means to be community and what it isn't. Is it just being together or being family or tied together. A thing I love about this movie is the later reflection on the movie saying maybe a bad night can also be good and it makes sense. This one night everyone felt alive, this one night they were more than just plantation pickers. They were lovers and musicians and big business. And maybe their faith would have been the same no matter what if you look to the ending of the movie. It is also about appropriation. How a white wants what the blacks have here, but he just wants community after losing his own, as an immigrant himself. It is also more than that, that these people also wanted family and love, something they thought money and power could get them but all they needed was the community they left. It´s a deep analysis of what community even means.This is shown well in one of my favourite scenes of all time now. The barn song that mixes all the cultures of \"black\" music and community. It is a masterclass in scene making and also cinematography. The cinematography is so great here. Having some beautiful shots and compositions. Usage of wide shots and colours create some timeless frames that is a feast for the eyes.If I needed to be a bit critical I would say the first half of the movie is better than the latter. The gangster community drama can feel a bit drowned out by the introduction of the supernatural. While I love that part to it seems less important and the part that is underutilized. This is also followed by a clear trailer scene explaining vampires in a bad way. The sound mixing was also not the best for me. Letting out sound in huge crowds for conversations felt like a weird choice to me.But overall I liked this movie a lot. I don´t see it as a new classic yet or see it as anything that grand or special in its genres, but man is it fun, man is it a feast for the eyes and ears and man is it a fun and emotional time. Sinners is no doubt an incredible movie, one that I loved to watch and I can only recommend seeing it on the big screen and small so this movie gets to move up in the word. It is just a masterclass on so many levels."

The only reason I had to throw that out there is there's some ahole out there that's assuming the good reviews are strictly bc its a primarily black led cast. I'm here to tell those people to shut up and watch this movie. Michael B Jordan is quickly becoming this generation's denzel....he's phenomenal in this movie. Every actor/actress was too. I'm a vampire kinda guy so this is right up my alley. The crazy thing is that, if there were no vampires, this would still be a good movie. The historical Jim Crowe era storyline and the two gangster twins and the mob back story was good on its own. Throw in vampires.....just take my money! It takes a while to introduce the vampires, but its worth it. I'm not gonna spoil the plot at all, cuz im not an ahole, but its just plain good from start to finish. I will give a piece of advice though, stay for the credits! I didn't the first time around, but when I saw it again I did. In closing, if you like old timey gangsters and vampires, all wrapped up in a really good movie....you better see this! Probably in my top 3 of favorite vampire movies ever! I can't give it enough praise! Also, don't wanna forget Coogler.....tremendous job!"

          "content": "The Good: Stellar cast. Refreshing setting. Soundtrack. The 1st half, basically.The Bad: Tonally inconsistent. Derivative set-pieces. Race-baiting. Too many half-baked ideas. The 2nd half, basically.The Verdict: I'm a fan of Ryan Coogler's previous efforts (\"Fruitvale Station\" (2013), \"Creed\" (2015), and even \"Black Panther\" (2018)), but feel this picture is waaaaaaay overhyped. The 1st half is SO well put together with its plant-and-payoff script, strong characterisations, and gripping storyline. However, this terrific start is FUBARRED by the time the awesome Jack O' Connell arrives on scene. The film does a bait-and-switch-and-switch-again which just doesn't work and has been done to perfection in Robert Rodriguez's \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" (1996). I'm a big time admirer of black cinema and rate directors such as Spike Lee, Steve McQueen, Raine Allen-Miller, the late John Singleton, and Barry Jenkins among my favourites. However, I don't know if this is some kind of resurgent Gen-Z blaxploitation cinema, but what Jordan Peele's \"Get Out\" (2017) is to \"The Stepford Wives\" (1975), \"Sinners\" (2025) is to the previously mentioned \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" (1996), even going so far as to directly lift scenes straight from it. You could argue it's an homage, but when it's executed this blatantly and badly, one can't help but feel it's a poor imitation. Then there's the references to John Carpenter's \"The Thing\" (1982) and \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968) as well as the bizarre, but dazzling, Baz Luhrmann-esque music numbers which are great, but the parts are greater than their sum. Overall, it feels like a film made by four different directors from four different scripts which gives a net feeling of disappointment with its lack of cohesion. \"Sinners\" (2025) is a film with ambition, definitely too much ambition that only works to its detriment. Like a blender-mix of \"Four Rooms\" (1995) with \"Vampire in Brooklyn\" (1995), too many genres with too little thematic narrative or reason only results in... mediocrity. That being said, it's one of the better offerings this year has on-screen (which isn't saying much), but what you gonna do?"

It wasn't until the following day that I understood why I was so deeply affected. The symbolism around racism and black survival modes was both subtle and overt. Back then good Christian black people did not dance or go to juke joints, the film title, Sinners was a reminder of those times. I got that but it wasn't until I thought about the statement, \"the Choctaws had been gone a long time\" and the mention of the town of Mound Bayou that I realized that Coogler had slipped in symbolism with the Choctaws as a reminder of genocide and the town of Mound Bayou as the highest and best black achievement of that time period. There are others, the Irishman, a white man as a demon, a vampire; the roots woman (non Christian African practices) was mother and lover and susceptible to evil. Fascinating that Coogler successfully melded so much into one film!."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler has long been one of my favorite filmmakers in recent years, and with Sinners, he once again proves why. From the powerful realism of Fruitvale Station to the cultural impact of Black Panther, Coogler's work consistently resonates with emotional depth and cinematic ambition. Sinners, now in theaters, continues that legacy. It's a film that had me captivated from beginning to end. It opens as a slow-burning emotional drama and gradually transforms into something crazy, in the best way.One of the standout elements of Sinners is Michael B. Jordan's phenomenal performance as twin brothers. He fully disappears into both roles, capturing the complexity and tension between the two characters with nuance and emotional weight. The film's allegorical layers give it a richness that rewards thoughtful viewing, making it clear that Coogler isn't just telling a story, but he's making a statement. The visual storytelling is equally impressive, with cinematography that is both intimate and grand, bringing every scene to life with purpose.What truly took me by surprise was the score, it's not just background music, it's a character of its own. The composition heightened every emotion, and there were moments where it genuinely moved me to tears. The use of sound is fantastic and the film's dialogue strikes a rare balance between being witty, dramatic, and intellectually engaging. Coogler also manages to blend two distinct tonal directions, personal emotion and epic metaphors, in a seamless whole that could have easily fallen apart in lesser hands.Hailee Steinfeld deserves praise for her performance, as does Delroy Lindo. They completely dive into these characters, adding even more depth/levity to the film's core story. Sinners is a film that demands a second viewing, not because it's confusing, but because it's so layered and affecting that you'll want to soak it all in again. I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw it. See it in theaters, if you can. It's more than worth your time, it's an experience."

          "content": "I went in watching with high expectations and with a wrong genre mind set ( Initially this was just listed under Horror and thriller genres on IMDB), I was totally disappointed when credits start to roll. Specifically for me, I could have had a better experience with the first half because it looked good to me( considering under the drama genre) but during the first half, at the back of mind, I was always waiting for something to happen keeping the genres in mind and by the end of it, I was like wtf did I watch, I had to literally check my mobile again during the middle of the movie, whether the reviews and genres that I saw were for the same movie or not! And during the second half it looked a lot better to me because my mind had already adjusted to it a bit and watching what I had been expecting for the first hour during the second hour, I didn't have to carry that uneasy feeling at the back of my mind and I was able to enjoy it properly.But from what I have watched, I don't think they haven't done anything new with the concept of vampires, I mean it looked like a simple survival thriller during the second half but most of the best parts of the movie came for me during the first half (which unfortunately I couldn't enjoy them to the fullest!) and some surprises(not the vampires) from the second half. Without a doubt that transition scene where we get to see the past and the future worlds colliding with the present had to be the best among all!Overall a decent movie so far for me, but I'll give this a try again once after the Blu-ray gets released and find out how well I can enjoy this again with all those underlying metaphors!"

The strong metaphoric undercurrent of the movie comes out so well and of course all credit goes to the director for this. The main lead Michael B Jordan does a phenomenal job (of course as usual but this time in double role). Surprisingly the music is also very good and the scenes involving the music are shot beautifully. The movie deserves to be watched on big screen and preferably on an IMAX screen. Refreshing to see a horror period film with a different refreshing story line. Highly recommend for all horror and thriller movie fans."

          "content": "Sinners is a brilliant horror film that also ended up being an amazing historical fiction and celebration of music, all whilst able to solidly deliver on vampire carnage.The acting from the ensemble cast is fantastic, with obvious praise to the dual roles from Michael B. Jordan, as he differentiates his performances enough to create discernible differences and conveying brotherhood in the characters' relationship and teamwork they share towards goals and problems throughout. Moreover, not-so-obvious praise goes to Miles Caton, who acts moreso as the star of the film, with much of it taking place from his point of view as the audience is introduced to the time period and customs; he manages to be a compelling character who is just as engaging to follow as Jordan's twins, which was shockingly excellent to witness. Further acknowledgements extend to Hailee Steinfeld, Omar Benson Miller and Delroy Lindo, who are all equally as entertaining as each other in their own unique ways. Jack O'Connell's performance as Remmick was devilishly delightful, with many moments of dark levity provided through his scenes as he oozes with sinister charisma. Being a period drama, the set and costume designs are all superbly realised and does a great job transporting audiences to that time and place. The makeup and special effects provide a plentiful amount of delicious gore, with both minor and major wounds looking very convincing and well-executed. Furthermore, the use of music in the film is masterfully executed, with scenes involving musical elements making for very stand-out moments that are absolutely breathtaking to behold. Additionally, the movie's masterful soundtrack manages to propel the movie's thrills and excitement levels even further. And what probably works most about the film is it's story and exploration of themes such as gangster culture, blues music, history, racism, oppression and more are all incredibly balanced, with none of them ever feeling underdeveloped, overbearing or competing for screentime because whether the movie is discussing one, two or three at a time it blends and layers it all into the story; the characters are prioritised and the overwhelming amount of subtext isn't necessary to notice in order to enjoy the film, and instead only adds to its overall quality.However, although the vampire action is everything you would expect and want from a film with this particular premise, it maybe feels more delayed than anticipated, as much screentime is used to establish setting and character arcs before the reigns are entirely let loose. This isn't necessarily a typically 'bad' thing, but it does create some wait time for impatient people not expecting the more 'artistic' aspects. And a very minor Native American aspect of the world-building felt like a weird inclusion, because on one hand it was a very cool idea to be introduced, but on the other hand it is never revisited and ends up coming across as a missed opportunity.Regardless, Sinners is a feast founded on a frightfully elegant dedication to the exploration of blues culture and offers a fantastic array of action, scares and themes to be entirely engulfed in."

          "content": "In 1930s America, two twin brothers try to restart their lives opening a juke joint, only to discover things are even worse than they remember them. Ryan Coogler's film is exquisitely structured. The first two thirds are careful laying of narrative and character beats, building atmosphere, period detail, and depth of characters. When things take a turn for the horror genre in the final third, it's well earned, comes as a shock but not a surprise, and is superbly executed. As a thematic piece it's multi-layered - but perhaps its biggest concerns is white cultural appropriation of Black culture and identity. Michael Jordan is superb in his dual lead role of the twin brothers, and the support cast is exemplary, especially the outstanding Delroy Lindo. But this Coogler's film through and through. Beautifully written and directed with a sure, confident hand that lays foundations to be built on to great effect. The musical sequences are exceptional, and one in particular is moving and surprising as it gives visual representation to the idea of music piercing the veil that divides past and future. A stunning, adventurous piece of cinema that works on multiple levels and is rich with ideas."

It is all so genuine and real, it is made with heart and soul. This movie was not made with the sole purpose of making money. This movie was made because Coogler has a vision, an artistic goal and purpose, and stories that need to be told. He makes movies by Black people, with Black people, and for Black people. He deserves unlimited budgets and unlimited creative freedom to make whatever he wants to make, because he knows what he is doing, and he cooks up every single time. I cannot wait for his next original film.Please, do yourself a favor and see this thing on the IMAX screen if you can. I have seen it twice on IMAX and once on the regular screen. So much of the movie is shot using IMAX cameras. The already captivating images are made even grander on the IMAX screen. It is seriously invigorating and enthralling seeing the massive sets, the extended cuts, the unique landscapes, and the actors faces on the full IMAX screen.SEE THIS MOVIE. You owe it to yourself, to Ryan Coogler, and to the cast / crew to go watch this motion picture.SPOILERS:I mean seriously. The first time I watched this movie, as it was getting to and through the denouement, I was thinking this was a strong 9/10 or 9.5/10. Then, Coogler includes this final scene of Smoke just mowing down these KKK guys. Bro whips out the BAR and the Tommy Gun and unloads like 200 rounds into all these stinky KKK morons. It does not get any better than that, folks. That is why we go to the movies. That is cinema. And then, that leads into a beautiful ending sequence for the character Smoke. AND THEN, the final epilogue and true ending to the movie happens, and it is inarguably thoughtful and beautiful.The final line of the movie has not left me. \"I think, up until the sun went down.. that was the best day of my life. Was it like that for you?\"\"No doubt. The last day I seen my brother. The last day I seen the sun. And for just a bit there, we were truly free.\" Perfection."

The Movie \"Sinners\" is about 2 twin brothers who Return to their hometown and start a local bar, but then greater evil (vampires) come to destroy it. The story was very refreshing, it was new, original and actually good which is something we have been waiting in Hollywood. The characters were very powerfully written, especially Sammy! Also the actors do a phenomenal job in portraying the characters, the standouts were Micheal B. Jordan and Miles Canton. Also the visuals are \"Fantastic\".The problems with this movie for me come with the humor, I understand that it's a horror movie and humor is not used that much but every attempt they made did not make me laugh out loud. There is unnecessary s*x and n*dity in the movie which massively lowered the rating for me. The first 30 mins are kinda boring but that's just a small problem.In conclusion, For a horror movie it's by far the best I have seen but as a movie it's still pretty solid, 7.9/10 definitely recommend to watch in Cinemas."

And because of that, I feel like fewer people will be willing to admit how they really feel about it. After all the hype and anticipation, and with those well-made trailers, I genuinely wanted to enjoy Sinners.Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed to hear that Sinners is, honestly, a very half-baked movie (or rather, musical) that leans too heavily on its cast and the same old, often tiring Black culture clichés. Because of this, the movie doesn't deliver anything close to a meaningful plot or story. It starts off slow, making you think you're about to get something rich and layered, but you quickly realize it's just a buildup to nothing, with a string of disconnected scenes trying to force context for a historical vampire horror story that ends up feeling hollow, long-winded, and poorly executed. It achieves very little in any of the genres it tries to be.Watching this in a theatre with a mixed audience was honestly embarrassing, knowing it was headed toward the same recycled plot, and worse, a badly executed one.The one bright spot? Michael B. Jordan carried this film. Without him, I'm not sure I would've made it through."

Why did the vampires just pause for a bit in the fight and say \"let's go\" if they don't die from bullets. The fact that the director made it so obvious that the magic lady was going to die and the twin was going to have to kill him is just awful. The movie literally had inconsistency's all over it. How do the vampires catch on fire when the sun comes up, but not die. Do you not think the vampires may have thought to check the time before burning alive? But that didn't seem to matter since they came back to life at the end. Funny that. Useless movie. I wish I could give it a 0/10."

I expected something symbolic and thought-provoking, spiritual metaphors that explore the pain, trauma, and resilience passed down through generations. Unfortunately, the film missed the mark.Instead, it turned out to be a vampire movie with clichéd dialogue, the writing felt weak, and the way the characters spoke especially the supportive \"stay strong\" kind of lines felt more like stereotypical portrayals of Black speech than genuine emotion or depth. The spiritual and historical weight that the film could have carried was replaced with shallow horror tropes.Even the music worked against the film. It lacked seriousness and emotional depth, often clashing with the weight of the story the film could have told. Rather than enhancing the atmosphere, it made the film feel even more disconnected from its subject matter.There was great potential here to shine a light on slavery in a much more nuanced and meaningful way. Sadly, Sinner chose style over substance, and the opportunity to tell a truly impactful story was lost."

          "content": "4/10 - and that's purely for the moody soundtrack and the cinematography that clearly didn't get the memo the script was a mess.Sinners follows twin brothers who return to their hometown hoping for a fresh start... which is adorable, because nothing says \"new beginning\" like going back to the exact place where all your trauma began. Naturally, they're welcomed by something even more evil; possibly the plot itself.This movie tries to be deep and brooding, but ends up feeling like a long, slow-motion music video where everyone forgot what they were acting about. There's a lot of walking, a lot of staring, and an evil force so vague it might just be unresolved family drama in a hoodie.The script flirts with themes of redemption and darkness but never really commits, like that one friend who says they're going to the gym and just ends up at the smoothie bar.If Sinners teaches us anything, it's that not even atmospheric lighting and a killer score can save a film from flat characters, forced drama, and the kind of twists you see coming from a mile away... while blindfolded.Recommended only if you're into stylish suffering and want to hear ominous violins while nothing particularly interesting happens."

          "content": "Just watched Sinners and I've got to say, it really surprised me - in a good way. I went in not knowing exactly what to expect, but from the first few scenes, it completely pulled me in. The story has a strong grip; it unfolds in a way that keeps you curious and wanting to know more, without giving everything away too soon. I love movies that manage to balance suspense and character development, and Sinners does that really well.One of the first things that stood out to me was the pacing. It's steady and deliberate, but never drags. You're always getting just enough new information or tension to keep things moving, but it also gives you time to really sit with the characters and understand what they're going through. Sometimes movies try to move so fast they forget to let moments land - this one doesn't have that problem. It feels thoughtfully put together.Speaking of the characters, the performances here are solid across the board. You can tell the cast really cared about bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. There's emotion in even the quieter moments, and I appreciated that subtlety. Nothing felt over the top or forced, which makes everything more believable. Even when things get intense (and they definitely do), it still feels grounded. That kind of balance is hard to pull off, but they managed it here.Visually, the film also delivers. The cinematography is clean but atmospheric, which adds a lot to the overall mood. There are certain scenes where the lighting and framing really help build tension or highlight a character's emotion without needing a bunch of flashy effects. It's stylish in a way that supports the story rather than distracting from it. I always appreciate when a film uses visuals to enhance rather than overshadow the plot.Another thing I really liked is how the movie creates this sense of unease or tension that lingers even in scenes where nothing outwardly dramatic is happening. That's a sign of good direction and writing. You're on edge, but you're not entirely sure why - and that keeps you locked in. It's engaging without relying on cheap tricks or jump scares, which I think a lot of people will appreciate.The themes the movie touches on are also pretty thought-provoking. Without giving anything away, it definitely left me thinking about some bigger questions even after the credits rolled. It's one of those films where you could easily have a conversation about it afterward and everyone might have picked up on something a little different. I love when movies do that - when they entertain you but also leave you with something to chew on.Overall, Sinners feels like a film made with care and intention. It doesn't feel like it's trying to follow a formula or cater to trends; instead, it tells its story in its own voice, and that makes it stand out. It's intense at times, but it also has these quieter, more reflective beats that give it real emotional weight. It strikes a really nice balance between being thrilling and thoughtful.I'd definitely recommend it if you're looking for something that's engaging, well-acted, and leaves a bit of an impact. It's not just background noise - it's a movie you'll actually want to pay attention to, and it rewards you for doing so. All in all, I'm really glad I watched it, and I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for what the filmmakers do next. Sinners is definitely worth your time."

I love Vampire movies and have been disappointed with the last few Vampire movies that have come out (Nosferatu, Abigail, Salem's Lot, The Last Voyage of The Demeter). Even with Michael B Jordan being in it I was still a bit hesitant but I have to say he did not disappoint. I loved everything about this movie the vibe, the culture, the music, the goriness and the hidden messages. Will definitely be watching this again \"Smoke\" and \"Stack\" definitely going down as one of my favorites."

Technically speaking is a great film, th lighting, acting, directing, dressing and production design is pefect.But it feels like two different movies. The first half having all the homages, the reflection of discrimination in modern times, also hinting things about Capone, the escaped from the mafia and the impact the african american culture has had in the world (my favourite half). The rest felt like pure action and bloddlust, I didný feel the second half used watered the seeds planted on the first. I ended up with many questions and mixed feelings. I think mostly because the vampires appear too late in the movie, and have nothing to do with our main cast. Maybe if the main vampire interacted before with the brothers, or he was a member of the clan (making it a clan of vampires, continuing with the discrimination message). I dont know exactly what else to say, but I felt wierd."

Unlike any horror I've ever experienced, it was deeply spiritual, layered with hidden (and not-so-hidden) messages. There was two parts where you could feel the pull-like something reaching out and inviting you in. I get now why devout folks are calling it demonic. Those parts doesn't scare you-it intoxicated you. It felt like your soul was floating, caught between revelation and dread. Like that moment right before catching the Holy Ghost-it made you want to shout; except this wasn't the Holy Ghost. This was something darker, heavier. Even the young adults with me were talking about it afterward. I thought they wouldn't get it, but they did. They all said it felt like they were being pulled into the screen. I would love to see several spinoffs from Rimmy, Slim, Smoke & Stack in Chicago, their earlier years. The door is wide open to give fans so much more. It makes you want to know more."

About what is sacred, about the tradeoffs of power, about what real freedom is and requires of us. Still, this film never felt too heavy or didactic. More than anything, you're along for the ride at the Smokestack brothers' juke joint in the Delta - listening to the Blues, cheering for the heroes, and feeling the same kind of transcendant joy and overwhelming fear that they do. The whole thing works at so many levels and in so many ways. I'd have to watch it multiple times to get all the things Coogler has to say. And I just might."

The refinement in paying homage to the classics of Western cinema, as well as the traditions of vampire literature, is impressive.

At its heart are flawed, deeply human characters-each carrying secrets, regrets, and wounds they can't quite outrun. The performances are raw and lived-in, with every glance and silence weighted with meaning. As the story unfolds, it asks uncomfortable questions: Can people truly change? Is forgiveness ever earned-or just taken? The final act doesn't offer easy answers, but it hits with emotional precision. Sinners is a bruising, beautifully crafted tale about the cost of confronting your past and the brutal grace of survival. It lingers long after the credits roll."

          "content": "Sinners is as good as everyone says it is. Ryan Coogler's latest is a daring and original fusion of historical fiction and gothic horror-a heady mix of ideas that manages to be both socially incisive and viscerally thrilling. At its core, Sinners is a complex meditation on the two-way cultural traffic between dominant cultures and the minority communities that live beside, within, and often in resistance to them.The film opens as historical drama. The Moore brothers-former mobsters turned entrepreneurs-are trying to go straight by opening a juke joint for Black locals, deep in a Klan-dominated town. Alongside them is Sammie, a gifted musician torn between the church of his domineering pastor father and the secular promise of jazz and blues. Coogler's evocation of this 1930s Black and Asian enclave-geographically just across the street from the all-white town but worlds apart-is rich in texture without being nostalgic or overly decorative. He mostly avoids the genre's traps: there's no fetishizing of the past, no indulgent period details for their own sake. (And I said mostly because at times the film does fall into those traps). Instead, what we get is a grounded and often brutal lesson in survival-how commerce, community, and culture are built under siege.More than commerce, though, it's music that takes center stage. It is both a spiritual language and the primary cultural export of the Black community in the film-both their gift and, perhaps, their curse. That's when the film shifts gears to gothic horror, as Remmick, the fourth major character, a white, smooth-talking, and vampiric in more than one sense walks in. Drawn to Sammie's talent he offers collaboration, uplift, even transcendence-at the price of your soul. Remmick's seductive \"universalism\" rejects both the racism of the white town and the rootedness of the Black community. It's a hollow promise that asks people to sacrifice identity for access, soul for success. Coogler uses well the vampire metaphor: Remmick has to be invited in. An act of complicity is required. The allegory is layered-an echo of how minority cultures can be seduced into co-opting their own. There is a subtle Marxist lesson how capitalism, cloaked in liberal values, finds new ways to exploit the very thing it claims to elevate.Even the film's epilogue, where an older Sammie has become the musician he always dreamed of being, resists closure. As 1980s-styled vampires Stack and Mary arrive to tempt him once more, they appear both as icons of Black cool and embodiments of commercial assimilation. The temptation of Sinner never really leaves-it just changes its clothes.Coogler doesn't settle for easy villains or pat messages. Sinners doesn't call for cultural purity or separation, nor does it point fingers in the cultural appropriation wars. Everyone's a sinner. The ilm invites us to grapple with the blurry lines between cultural exchange, survival, seduction, and betrayal.As a horror film, it's gripping. As a work of political and cultural critique, it's haunting. And as a piece of filmmaking, it is masterful-buoyed by fine, nuanced performances from nearly the entire cast. Sinners isn't just a great film. It's a daring conversation starter, one that sticks with you."

The music was pretty good, and the lead guitarist actor was alright. The voodoo lady actor was alright too. But then when they open the nightclub and there's the world music fest for no reason with DJs and turntables and Prince look-alikes, it goes full stupid. This is further proof that you can't depend on other people's ideas of what makes a good movie, much less a good horror movie. At least there was a crowd in the theater. But they were like awkwardly laughing at parts that weren't intended to be funny, like the almost touching moment where the vampires start singing and dancing, which was albeit also stupid, but at least it showed more heart than most of the characters in the movie. Michael B. Jordan was interesting to watch, but his character lacked any meaningful back story. The director here, Ryan Coogler, went to \"film school\" and owed over $200,000 in student loans when he was done. It shows in how formulaic and predictable his movies all are."

Were the vampires and Klan separate evil forces, or was the entire movie a retelling of the Klan, that they were as evil as vampires, and the entire movie was a metaphor?Finally, the fact that they gave Hailee Steinfeld one of the two lead closing credits - the other being Michael Jordan - was simply crass commercialism.And simply too much gore, other than to appeal to viewers who wanted more action from a movie that up until that point was slow and aimless. The blood and torn human tissue failed to rescue this movie for me.The A+ soundtrack was the only saving grace."

It's well made and has a couple of interesting ideas. If they removed all the stupid explanation, leaned into the music-magic a little more and made the big gun fight less ridiculous, it could have been great."

It was superficial.Also, the first shots made us expect a movie as brilliant as Interstellar but it fell short of the premise.At one moment a shot put me under the impression that we were going to witness a Planet Terror like movie. But this did not happen at all. Gore was unconvincing and flat.Give it a couple of months and the rating will be much lower than 8.2. I think it is way overrated."

There's no backstory given, there's no motivation given and there's no connection given - instead, we're left with more questions and a complete emotional detachment to anyone on the screen.The second half, had so much promise but it was a goofy, rushed mess. The whole backstory on the \"horror\" aspect is completely missed and instead we're expected to just be \"immersed\" and \"scared\". It frankly felt like a rip off of From Dusk Till Dawn. There wasn't a moment I felt bad for anyone in this film and that's saying a lot.The music, casting and acting were all very good, but that's about all I can say.To quote Peter Griffin, it insists on itself."

The score adds more depth to an already impressively defined movie.There is a scene in the movie, that if you're reading this before watching, you will know it when you see it. Words will not do it justice but I will say the incredible shots and progression of the music itself tuck you into the film a little tighter. Miles Caton's voice is mesmerizing, piercing through the time traveling music.Finally-the villains. The vampires were portrayed in such a refreshing way-inviting and menacing, unsuspecting except for the very subtle glimmer in their eyes. The need to be invited in was such an interesting touch. It adds to the sensation of figuring out who's who and for those who weren't turned , how to approach.The entire cast is excellent from beginning to end and the movie will go down as one of the best this year, I'd argue that so far, it is the best.More of this please!!"

The story dives headfirst into guilt, shame, forgiveness, and the messy contradictions that make us human. It's not always an easy watch-but it's the kind of film that sticks with you, the kind that sparks conversations and lingers in your chest.The performances are incredible across the board, but the lead is on another level-quiet, intense, totally magnetic. You feel every inner conflict, every unsaid word, and it all builds to this emotional payoff that genuinely took my breath away. The direction is confident, the pacing tight, and the cinematography is just stunning. Some scenes are so beautifully composed they feel like paintings-haunting, poetic, and loaded with subtext.The score is minimal but effective, adding just the right amount of tension or tenderness without ever overwhelming the moment. And the writing? Sharp, layered, and refreshingly unafraid to let characters be complicated, even unlikable at times. That honesty is what gives the film its power.Sinners is a rare gem-bold, thought-provoking, and deeply human. It's the kind of movie you immediately want to talk about with someone, to unpack all the choices and moments that hit you hardest. Easily my favorite film this year. Don't miss it!"

Sure it's a bit weird and different. But it fit so much better than the trailer represented. It goes some weird places, no doubt it takes you on a acid trip of a journey almost but it's a good one. To my suprise king fish was up on stage at the end, instant half a star for including him! This is a much watch and I recommend it to anyone. It's better than the recent werewolf movie that included it's own twist. This did it weird but right.Watched at AMC on 4-25-2025."

I really couldn't make sense of it.It also drove me insane how the majority of them died. You're telling me the main vampire who has been around for hundreds of years doesn't know signs that the Sun is about to come up yet? They're all just huddled outside watching him goof around with Sammy and then the Sun comes up and kills them all. Seriously, it is extremely goofy in an otherwise good movie.I've never seen a movie have SO much good parts of it but fumble the seemingly easy parts, I feel like this couldve been a really awesome one if there wasn't so many goofy parts."

I welcomed the slowness at the start. I was even in a trance in every scene up until the picked poor robin clean. After that it just moved very weird like the pacing was weird.

Much like Lovecraft Country, this draws heavily from myths and legends across multiple cultures, and lends heavy weight to ancestral connections. But it also takes a page from the best action films of the 80s (like Predator) in allowing for a slow build and a lot of backstory. Michael B. Jordan stars as a Yoruba-inspired set of twins, returning to their home after a stint in Chicago working for the mob. Now they're keen to set up a juke joint with the best blues music, featuring their musical prodigy cousin, Sammi. To reach success, he has to get around vampires, both literal and metaphorical. The music in this film is so good it will make you clutch your heart - and that includes the background score. The blues music I expected, but the Irish folk music scenes were also powerful. My only complaint is that Michael B. Jordan played both twins so similarly that if the hats weren't there to ease the ID of who he was playing, it would have been hard to tell them apart. For example, my husband and I both thought one of the brothers had two girlfriends, and didn't realize they each just had one until the middle of the movie. Beyond this, I really appreciate the inclusion of Chinese grocery merchants, which is an important aspect of Southern history that often goes unnoticed. Overall this is an excellent film, that was even more enjoyable the second time."

We the go to \"One Day Earlier\", and we are introduced to twin brothers Smoke and Stack who have just arrived from Chicago in Clarksdale, intending to buy a former sawmill and turning it into a juke joint. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from producer-writer-director Ryan Coogler, and his 5th collaboration with actor Michael B. Jordan. Here Coogler seems to take the movie into one direction only to then create other directions altogether. Is it a gangsta movie? A civil rights movie? A blues movie? A vampire movie? All of the above? I must admit it left me at times confused, at times overwhelmed, at times puzzled. All of it is executed very well, none more so that the music that is omni-present. The original score is courtesy of Coogler's house composer Ludwig Göransson and is masterful. When all is said and done, I admit that I left the theater with mixed feelings.\"Sinner\" is now into its third weekend release in US theaters, and it is doing extremely well, both critically (currently rated 98% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels overly generous to me)) and commercially (outperforming all expectations at the box office). The Saturday matinee where I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was sold out to the last seat). If you are a fan of Ryan Coogler's earlier work or of Michael B.

And because of that I am not going to attempt to describe its genre, its theme, or its story, as (1) I would not do it justice, and (2) other / different interpretations might well be just as valid, and (3) I do not wish to 'give anything away' (as in 'Spoiler'). Enough to say that twin Brothers Smoke and Stack (both played by the sensational Michael B. Jordan) return from their criminal lives in Chicago to hometown Mississippi and open up a juke-joint / nightclub. And what follows will come as a shock to every viewer. Many of whom will consider it great. But, to be honest, many well-intended viewers may call it a wasted two hours. I can understand and appreciate both views.Michael B. Jordan is both empathetic and hostile-filled as the two very different brothers; he pulls off that difficult task very well. We always know which of the two brothers we're currently involved with. In supporting roles, Tenaj L. Jackson as Beatrice is 'can't-take-your-eyes-off-her' magnificent; both to look at and listen to as the joint's female belter of the blues. Hailee Steinfeld as the 'not-quite-black' Mary is equally effective; her scenes leave us astonished at her powerful presence while at the same time concerned for her safety. Andrea Ward Hammond is the epitome of strong black womanhood; she nails it. Delray Lindo as a local drunk blues legend Delta Slim steals every scene in which he's featured; I've seen him in many roles but never realized the range and depth of his ability to play a variety of characters. As a symbol of absolute evil we've got Jack O'Connell, and if anyone could better represent evil as having a seductively Irish wink of the eye, I'd like to get his name.If I have any gripes (and I'm more than willing to overlook them) they are these. (1) I'm not entirely certain about what actually takes place in a physical sense, as opposed to a mystical or dream-like sense; a barn that seemingly burns down but is then brought back to life is representative of this. And finally (2) the placement of an important scene following the film's credits seemed and still seems absurd to me. I assure you, people will leave the theatre before seeing it and, as such, might have a different understanding to one of the film's plot points.But again, small potatoes. This is great film-making. Chancy, risk-taking film-making. Film-making that deserves to be seen."

And yes, when watching it, yeah, obviously-obviously!- you can't ignore the historical relevance and context of it, or the impact to today, now, at the time when it has released.It's one of those movies that will be looked back on, and categorized as a 'classic' of the era.Yeah. It was perfect. Except for the pacing, sure, but... I loved it. It's such a... it's just such a good movie. Gory, yeah, watch out- but I would 100% recommend!!!"

          "content": "\"Sinners\" is a very interesting experience and certainly powerful at many moments. The scene of the Blues at the party and the emergence of various artistic expressions from different eras, focused on black culture, is one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a movie theater this year; it's impressive how \"Sinners\" works with music so well, transforming it into a metaphor for the history of black people, in the United States and abroad. Ryan Coogler can already be considered a big name in blockbuster cinema and an absolutely great filmmaker far beyond commercial cinema. Although I really liked \"Sinners\", it's undeniable that the film has some problems, the story is not innovative and the way he conducts the film can sometimes seem very Tarantino-esque, and it's impressive how filmmakers who try to emulate Tarantino's style only manage to absorb the worst of him. \"Sinners\" is certainly a good experience, but it ends up being disappointing at many points, like the climax of tension that always ends up being a bit disappointing. The long ending and the uninteresting post-credit scene also end up making the ending of \"Sinners\" a bit \"weak\"; in the end, the best the film has to offer is in scenes that don't necessarily have a connection with vampires; the metaphors and semiotics end up being what transform \"Sinners\" into a powerful experience. In the end, the pleasure is in \"dancing with the devil\", that is, the music and dance scenes are the most enjoyable."

          "content": "I'm a huge horror movie fan, and I was excited to see this movie as soon as I heard that Michael B. Jordan would be the lead and that Ryan Coogler would be directing. I avoided the trailers, and once the first reviews came out, I couldn't wait to watch it because people promised it would be absolutely spectacular.And in a way, they were right. However, for me personally, there were still a few minor flaws.The story follows twin brothers who return to their hometown in Mississippi to open a bar for the local Black community, a place to relax and escape the burdens of daily life. The twins, named Smoke and Stack, are both played by Michael B. Jordan. They've just come back from Chicago, where they made a lot of money through illegal means. On opening night, the bar is visited by some troubling guests.If you've seen trailers or heard anything at all about this movie, you probably know what subgenre it belongs to, so I'll just say it outright. It's a vampire flick. But more than that, it's a period drama that addresses important historical themes. I've heard comparisons to From Dusk Till Dawn, and while I can see why, I think that comparison does Sinners a disservice. Tonally, it's completely different. It's more serious, with weightier themes, and it doesn't go off the rails in the third act like From Dusk Till Dawn does.Sinners takes time to deeply explore its main characters, their backstories, and their motivations. It's set in 1930s Mississippi, a time and place where being Black came with immense hardship. The film doesn't shy away from that reality and emphasizes it through powerful dialogue and thoughtful scenes. It's also breathtakingly shot, with masterful sound design. Everyone involved in the production shows tremendous talent. Ryan Coogler directs with confidence and purpose, and the rest of the team deserves praise as well.There are a few musical sequences, and I usually roll my eyes when movies break into song and dance. It's just not my thing. But here, those scenes were so beautifully shot and edited that they were genuinely enjoyable to watch.The first half of the film is nearly flawless from a cinematic perspective. However, as a horror fan, I began to worry that there wouldn't be much action or actual horror. Eventually, the tone does shift toward that genre. While such transitions can be risky, Coogler manages it fairly well. Still, it feels like a slight dip in quality. The horror elements were decent but not as strong or impactful as I had hoped. The film had spent so much time building its world and characters that the finale, while enjoyable, felt a bit rushed and out of sync with the realistic tone established earlier.That said, it's far from bad. The third act is still entertaining and decently executed, just not as spectacular as I expected, especially with From Dusk Till Dawn in the back of my mind.In the end, this is still a phenomenal film and absolutely worth watching, ideally in IMAX if you can. It's a thrilling ride through emotions and genres, with strong performances, stunning cinematography, and an engaging, meaningful story. It's not perfect, but compared to the flood of generic and uninspired films released these days, this one stands out as a true gem.Also, be sure to stay seated through the credits. Enjoy.[7.3/10]"

          "content": "Rating - 8.6:\nOverall, a very good vampire action movie that does a great job showcasing the rich black culture of the Delta Mississippi; but, this movie sacrifices a fully developed conflict for strong character writing, and this ultimately holds the movie back as it's never clear why these events are happening.Direction - Very Good:\nThe direction on a macroscale is great as he builds this world very well; the 1930s Delta Mississippi, rich in Black culture and the blues, and he does a great job building the action sequences against this backdrop of the juke joint; the direction on a microscale is very good as you can see the chemistry this cast has; they really do feel like a family, and when the vampires come in, you can see this clash between the two sides; the storytelling is a little unconventional as the first half of this movie builds the background for these characters and their history; but the second half is just a straightforward horror action conflict that feels kind of shallow; he builds tension in a very gimmicky horror way as he relies a lot on jump scares in the first half to remind you that this is a horror movie; but he does a pretty good job building tension in the second half by raising the stakes of the conflictStory - Good:\nThe concept, at the end of the day, is a standard vampire action movie, but mixes in stories of the Delta during the height of Jim Crow to show the richness and thriving Black culture at the time that is trying to be suppressed; the plot structure is a tale of two halves, as the first half is entirely exposition and building these characters up, and the second half is a straightforward vampire-action movie; this movie sacrifices a clear and fully developed conflict for strong character writing, as Coogler puts more emphasis on these characters and how they are connected, and while this is strong, it just feels like everything happens all at once and you never really get a sense of the significance of the conflict; it feels like 30 minutes of the movie was cut, and this 30 minutes would have really helped bridge the two halves of the movieScreenplay - Very Good:\nThe dialogue is true to the time period and the culture; the humor is pretty funny, as it helps you care for these characters and lightens the mood; the symbolism is incredibly profound, as it touches on Black culture, the delta, and blues music, while also briefly touching on racism and the KKK during the Jim Crow South; the foreshadowing is prevalent for minor storylines and the characters, but is pretty bad for the conflict because it just feels like it happens with no reasonActing - Good:\nMichael B. Jordan - Good (Probably the best we are ever going to see Michael B. Jordan act, as he plays this dual role very well and leads every scene he is in, fully embodying both characters; there is a clear acting limit in some of the scenes he is in), Hailee Steinfeld - Good (Feels a bit underutilized, but really embodies her character and has good chemistry with Jordan), Miles Caton - Pretty Good (Does a pretty good job considering this is his acting debut, but has a little stiffness you would see from a newer actor; he has clear singing and musical talent that comes alive on screen), Jack O'Connell - Pretty Good to Good (Plays this villain role well as he has a sinister feel to him; He does well in the musical scenes, having a haunting aura to him), Wunmi Mosaku - Good (Has good chemistry with Michael B. Jordan and has a commanding presence in her scenes; has a gravity that attracts others to her as she tries to help others), Jayme Lawson - Decent to Pretty Good (Plays her role well, but has a little stiffness; her chemistry with Caton feels a little forced and rigid), Omar Miller - Good (A real comedic relief performance as he helps bring out the humor in all the scenes he is in; he has good chemistry with those around him), Buddy Guy - Decent (Basically, a cameo), Delroy Lindo - Very Good (The best performance in the movie, as he truly embodies the character and shows a wide range of emotions playing both a drunkard and someone with past trauma; it also helps that he's given the best lines in the movie), Li Jun Li - Pretty Bad (I really could not stand her accent as it felt like a mix of Southern and Chinese, but in a way that both just clashed; she does not really have any chemistry with the rest of the cast), Rest of the cast - Pretty Good (Everyone plays their role well, no matter how big or small, as they help tell the story and support the main cast)Score - Great:\nIncredibly rich in blues and themes from the time period, it brings to life the Black culture of that time periodSoundtrack - Good:\nIt helps bring out the blues and Black culture from the time period that was being suppressed and stolenCinematography - Very Good:\nMixes both 70MM and IMAX 70MM very well to help create the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s; the cinematography is also well shot during the action sequencesEditing - Good:\nWell-polished and stitched together; More of an issue was the cut, but some scenes felt longer than needed, like the music between eras scene; it felt like 30 minutes of the story was cut to help bridge the conflict with expositionSound - Good:\nPolished and well-used to help build tension, even though it is overused a little in the first half for the jump scaresVisual Effects - Good:\nGood for the most part and feels high-budget, but there are some elements that felt a little tackyProduction Design - Great:\nDoes a great job emulating the Delta during the 1930s as it helps show the rich Black culture from that time periodMakeup - Pretty Good:\nPretty good, for the most part; The blood and lacerations looked very fakeCostumes - Very Good:\nIt does a very good job emulating the 1930s and helping to wardrobe these actors in that time periodPacing - Pacing is fine as the movie really does move throughout; there is just an issue with story constructionClimax - Climax is a good, ending fight scene that you would see in a high-budget action vampire movie; I really enjoyed what they did with the post-credit scenes as they felt like a true epilogue rather than throwaway scenesTone - Tone has elements of vampire horror and action, but the movie really showcases the Delta blues and the rich Black culture from that time periodFinal Notes - Watched this movie in both 1.90:1 and 1.43:1."

Another movie implying some faith doesn't work in fighting demons but a voodoo mojo does, nothing new there.I dislike musicals so its musical parts added nothing for me. The past and future music evoked could have been more abstract, but they were real people in different eras costumes mingling in, kinda ruined the believability of the 1930s vibe for me. Looked like a silly company dinner and dance instead.Can totally see certain demographic overhyping this. Again, nothing new.An okay watch overall, fun at times."

The eerie atmosphere of the American South mixed with supernatural elements sounds like a compelling combination on paper. Unfortunately, the execution falls short.The sudden appearance of a vampire feels abrupt and unexplained, making it seem more like a random twist than an integrated part of the story. Key questions remain unanswered: Why is the vampire here? What is his connection to the main characters? And what role does music play, which seems important but never truly finds its place in the narrative?The film attempts to be profound but struggles to develop its themes-such as ancestral guilt, identity, and the power of music-in a meaningful way. While there are some visually striking moments and the mood occasionally works, the writing lacks clarity and focus. With better exposition, character development, and buildup, this could have been a memorable experience.Conclusion: A film full of atmosphere and ambition, but missing the coherence to truly deliver."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's *Sinners* has created significant buzz for its ambitious blend of horror, historical drama, and musical elements. Set in the vibrant cultural landscape of 1930s Mississippi, the film follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack, portrayed with skill by Michael B. Jordan. As they open a juke joint, they inadvertently awaken supernatural forces that disrupt their lives. The film features outstanding performances and a captivating musical score, but it may not fully meet the high expectations it sets.Michael B. Jordan delivers a commendable dual performance, effectively distinguishing between the two brothers and showcasing his impressive talent. Ludwig Göransson's blues-inspired soundtrack enriches the film's authenticity and immerses the audience in its historical context.However, at 138 minutes, the pacing can feel sluggish, especially in the first half, which may challenge the patience of some viewers. Additionally, many supporting characters are not explored in depth, making it more difficult for the audience to form emotional connections with them.While the film is marketed as a horror experience, viewers might find that the scares are limited and often occur off-screen, potentially leaving horror enthusiasts wanting more intensity.In summary, *Sinners* offers a unique cinematic experience filled with strong performances and an engaging soundtrack. However, addressing pacing issues and further developing supporting characters could enhance its overall impact. The film's ambition is clear, and with a few adjustments, it could effectively fulfill the high promise of its intriguing premise."

          "content": "Director Ryan Coogler's Sinners contains a lot of flash: rip-roaring musical numbers, great acting performances, and compelling cinematography. It is a big screen spectacle, to be sure. Unfortunately, what it contains in pizazz it equally lacks in any sort of tight plotting or narrative.For a very basic overview, Sinners tells the story of identical twin brothers Smoke & Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who have come back to their 1930s Mississippi Delta hometown after a stint in Chicago. In starting a new gin-and-dance joint, the bros. Bite off a bit more than they can chew when the dulcet tones of musician Sammie (Miles Caton) summons beings of a supernatural nature.Like I said, there's enough pop in Sinners for it to never be a bad or certainly not a boring movie. Jordan continues to cement himself as a legitimate leading man star, Coogler is similarly spectacular behind the lens (nearly all IMAX, in this case), and the auxiliary cast of Hailee Steinfeld, Andrene Ward-Hammond, & Jack O'Connell are a treat to behold. All that alone will likely be enough for some--perhaps most--viewers to thoroughly enjoy this flick.But for lovers (like myself) of tight, narrative plot? Sinners really falls short in that department. The biggest deficit is how the supernatural angle of the proceedings really clashes with the historical component of it all--to the point of outright confusion in the endgame.Sinners also can't pull off being strictly a metaphorical film because Coogler himself won't commit to that approach. Perhaps valiant in scope, but not so much in execution.I realize I'm being a little harsh on Sinners, but I truly do believe that a coherent plot is a (maybe THE) central component of a good motion picture. In Sinners' case, not even the visual and musical fireworks could distract me from how confusing the overall narrative was."

A warm embrace in an otherwise sterile field of paint by numbers blockbusters and eat-your-vegetables indie movies. Here lies the heart of entertainment, an original concept with something to say and a soundtrack better than most musicals. I can't think of a movie since Inception with such substance combined with such artistry.The story is incredibly layered, but most people will walk out of the theater thinking they saw a blues movie with vampires, and perhaps that's why it works so well. Even if you don't grapple with the central theme, it's still entertaining.The first half of the movie is one of the best constructed and deepest realizations of the Afro-American experience in modern cinema. Here the crush of racism is quiet, insidious, and tangible and it sets the table for the central metaphor of the film. Suffering begets art, art enriches life, and it is often the expression of freedom in the face of oppression.Many viewers missed that the \"sinners\" are not the vampires, in fact the vampires are not inherently evil at all. They are the alternative to a system of pain and oppression, but to join them comes at a hefty cost. To join them is to lose your individuality, to become part of a collective with a shared memory but without the joys and connections of human vulnerability, without the expression of art.Ultimately the characters have to chose to live in a world where their suffering remains, but the beauty and truth of their experience guides their expression of freedom. Even tucked away in a tiny mill, on a dusty road, that freedom cannot be adulterated, cannot be lost. The choice of suffering begets a beauty only humanity can attain.What a wonderful metaphor for all who have come before and all that will come after."

This film is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen so far this year. I was immediately drawn in by the story and how it gradually unfolded. At first, it appeared to be a historical drama set in the past, possibly during or after the era of slavery, with a focus on personal stories from that time. However, the narrative quickly evolved. The dynamic between the father and son-especially the son's rebellion against his father's strict values and desire to do more than just attend church-added depth and tension. What truly impressed me was the unexpected plot twist. The story took a sharp, thrilling turn and transformed into something completely different, keeping me engaged and surprised. Michael B. Jordan delivered a powerful performance, bringing authenticity and emotion to every scene. The setting and dialogue reminded me of my southern roots in Alabama-the way the characters talked, interacted, and carried themselves felt familiar and real, which made the film even more impactful. Another standout element was the sudden shift into horror. The transition was so unexpected and intense, it genuinely shocked me-in the best way. The film also included several emotional scenes that added even more depth to the story. Overall, this was an outstanding movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to own it once it becomes available for purchase. It was beautifully acted, deeply emotional, and full of surprises. It's a truly great film-I loved it. When you let Ryan Coogler cook, a product is this movie. 9/10."

After Wakanda Forever disappointed me and WB began mistreating its own legacy, I was skeptical and I'm not a horror fan. After watching it, I enjoyed it. If you seen The Lost Boys and Michael Jackson's Thriller, that's what the film reminded me. But I loved its ambition and ideas. It's a little overhyped but that's good. An original movie doesn't get that these days. Like Alfred Hitchcock, this movie and Get Out will be talked about and studied in film school and classes. If it does get Academy Award nominations, I award it for Best Cinematography and Original Screenplay. It's safe to say that Ryan Coogler and Jordan Peele are the masters of modern horror."

There are freaky moments, but nothing truly shocking or boundary-pushing.The acting is wildly uneven. Some performances are great; others feel rushed or misdirected. Two Asian characters in particular could've used another take or another casting. Sammie's accent disappears mid-film, especially in the car scenes, which pulled me out of it.My biggest issue? The ending-and the muddled metaphors leading up to it. The \"past and future\" sequence looks cool, but feels disconnected from the film's tone. And then there's the finale: Smoke suddenly pivots from fighting vampires to killing KKK members. Fine, but what about the vampire victims left behind? Are they just... chill now? The souls are still trapped. \"When I die, set me free\", but no one's freed. The message collapses in on itself.Then there's the deeper meaning ¬_¬. Vampires as white people, draining music and culture from Black artists. \"I want your talents.\" \"Share your gift.\" We get it. It's not that the metaphor is invalid; it's just tired. Is this Helter Skelter for the A24 crowd? Does every genre film now have to be a race war allegory? White people are cool. Black people are cool. Everyone's cool. We know the history. But sometimes I just want a great story, not a lecture.Violence solves everything in Sinners. Not music. Not unity. Just violence. And that's a shame, because the premise had real potential. Imagine a film where music breaks the curse. Instead, we get a half-decent popcorn flick disguised as a cultural touchstone.Worst of all, I can already see this being five-starred into legend. Racists scared to critique a Black filmmaker will call it genius to hide their fear. \"How can I be racist? I loved Sinners.\" Please.Coogler, you've already made great work. Don't let the vampire inside devour your voice. We don't need the Avengers again. We need you."

From the very beginning, the cinematography pulls you into a world that feels both historically rooted and eerily timeless. The shadows, the stillness, the textured light-it's all intentional, painting a portrait of a past that still feels painfully present.The writing is bold, unflinching, and laced with a darkness that speaks to generational trauma and spiritual unrest. Yet it's the music-haunting, soulful, sometimes jarring-that elevates the film to a different realm. The soundtrack doesn't just support the narrative; it builds a whole new world. Every chord, every silence, feels necessary.The casting is equally impeccable-every performance feels lived in, raw, and real. These characters don't feel acted; they feel unearthed. You believe them. You ache for them.Creatively, this movie did something for me. It stirred something dormant, made me want to create, to express, to confront. Sinners is more than a film-it's a calling. A reminder of the power of storytelling when it's done with vision, purpose, and soul."

It's intense and true to the genre without being overly gory or gratuitous. Very few jump scares for those who don't like unexpected violence. Go see it, I'm sure people will be trying to replicate what this creative team did for years to come. Southern gothic has a whole new meaning!!"

For the first half of the movie it was completely a period piece showing life in the jim crow south during the prohibition era. The blues was a huge focus of this part and really throughout the whole movie. The musical display before the climax of the movie was extremely creative and had breath taking visuals. Michael B Jordan delivered a classic performance playing two very different characters. Both twins with a very close connection each brother was the foil character to the other. One brother being out spoken and charismatic while the other being much more rough and tough. Jordan pulled off both extremely well. Overall the cast did a fantastic job. My only issue was the writing. The reason behind why the vampires come is very briefly talked about and it really isn't covered. The defeat of the vampires doesn't make sense because it contradicts itself as to what was said early. Then the post credit scene contradicts the contradiction. So overall the movie was very well done but the ending piece of the writing felt rushed."

The storyline is very engrossing, albeit I have to admit the final quarter of the film kind of lost it for me, although I still enjoyed it in a kind of B-movie kind of way.It's a fine film, and really the greatest credit I can give it is that it's great to go to the cinema to watch something fresh and different that is smart & funny. I hope this trend continues.Worth viewing."

I have watched many movies in the past, and none of them were as disappointing as this. I expected more from the actor Michael B Jordan, as he was supposed to be the main actor and character.

Whatever she's in I watch since seeing her in Lovecraft Country. Arguably the lead, the person playing Sammie Moore, was innocent yet well versed in his business of music to which he was still green at performing when we meet him. The Twins brought their fire and provided some juxtaposing moments. There are many things that either act as a mirror or exist as some dichotomy. People and things serve multiple functions and I think that's what has everyone talking. I hate when a movie gets lauded because the contrarians come out and spoil some of the fun of people seeing the movie.Go see it if you liked 90s films like from Dust til Dawn or Eve's Bayou or even 90s westerns. People are bound to draw similarities since there's nothing new under the sun. But watching blind was by far the best experience because it made the twist that much more engaging. With everyone giving their two cents just watch because you like good storytelling and acting. I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice."

Music, especially the blues, is in fact the leading topic in this film, not as background score, but as a life-force in itself.The direction of this movie is so effective, the photography so beautiful, and the acting so convincing that it's just a joy to watch, and the big shift to the horror-part initially seems an unnecessary nuisance. But when from then on things develop into a carefully orchestrated, almost grand guignol orgy of violence, this actually gets a beauty of its own, albeit not for the tender hearted.I was truly impressed by both sides of this movie, as well as by the phenomenal soundtrack."

          "content": "Arriving at a time and place in the history of cinema where the wishes for original content to succeed are at an all-time high, Ryan Coogler's passion project Sinners is a brilliantly energetic reminder of the power of unique visions and big swings that has magically managed to become a critical, audience and box office hit that feels like the lighting of a match for the big screen experience the industry desperately needed.A multi-layered piece of genuine cinematic spectacle and entertainment that just so happens to pertain many metaphorical, philosophical and politically tinged undertones and conversation starters, Sinners is a lot of things all at once and it's hard to agree that every minor or major element comes off as perfectly balanced or nuanced as the other but there's absolutely no denying that Sinners is a breath of fresh air in a marketplace that has grown stale over recent years and the film is arguably Coogler's most important work yet as a director with a piece that should be regarded as his flawed but wonderfully entertaining masterwork.Taking it's time to get going as it lays its groundwork in a non-rushed manner and hard to talk about without going deep into spoiler territory, Sinners is a film that's best left to be explored by viewers with as little foresight into proceedings as possible, knowing only that Coogler's grand vision is a big-screen must, an audacious piece of cinema that takes inspiration from Metallica, From Dusk till Dawn, ancient folklore, musical history and Coogler's own very personal life, creating a melting-pot of ideas and aspects that can be enjoyed and appreciated in their own individual ways.Some overarching sentiments and takeaways from Sinners is that Coogler and his creative team, that includes awards worthy collaborations with composer Ludwig Göransson and cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw deliver knockout blows and it's hard to think of film in 2025 getting much better than witnessing a rousing rendition of Irish staple Rocky Road to Dublin or a stunning feat of filmmaking wizardry that takes us across a span of musical elements all in disguise of a one take continuous shot, these elements helping work wonders with a fired up cast all performing at the top of their game.Built around a fantastic double bill performance from Coogler's long-term feature film partner Michael B. Jordan as gangster twins Smoke and Stack, Sinners loaded ensemble are on fire here with the debut turn from renowned musician Miles Caton as the young and impressionable Sammi Moore, Jack O'Connell as the mysterious Rennick and Wunmi Mosaku as the wise Annie all standing out, while industry veteran Delroy Lindo is as good as his ever been and an early frontrunner for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar recipient as long-time Jazz musician Delta Slim.Put simply, Sinners is a joyously inventive and creative piece of art that has managed to become that rare all-round piece that manages to infiltrate the mainstream zeitgeist while also maintaining its creative integrity and beating heart.It has some narrative shortcomings and story beats that don't hold up to a deep dive of scrutiny but they're minor inconveniences and misses when weighed up around a film that has become one of the modern eras greatest success stories and a stern and timely reminder that original cinema is far from dead if audiences are treated with the respect they deserve.Final Say -A triumphant feat of originality and vision from Ryan Coogler that is gifted life by a collection of noteworthy performances and behind the scenes talent, Sinners is a film with some deep and thought-provoking elements while also having a whole lot of fun with its over the top ingredients, giving audiences as much of a reason to get to the big screen as there's going to be in 2025.4 cloves of garlic out of 5."

The first hour and a half of the movie nothing happens... Literally. There is no substance to anything. The first and second act are not existence.Script is bad, actions of characters don't make any sense, acting is poor. The only good thing about this movie is the music and some cinematography.I really don't understand how people weren't bored out of their mind watching this movie.I don't like it, it's boring, nonsensical and stupid.

          "content": "What I wanted was a good horror movie in a historically dark Southern time period told through the eyes of a marginalized community with a protagonist of questionable old fashioned mobster morals.What I recieved was a very muddy storyline that made little sense, a lot of historical references that needed after watch researching plus very thin characters and narrative.There were so many questionable subplots and underlying messages that I couldn't even really tell what the director is trying to convey with any sense of accuracy. The characters feel hollow and each of their conclusions felt questionable and uninteresting. I feel like the film itself was slow all the way until the climax, and then it didn't really conclude in any meaningful way. Maybe because I didn't feel attached to the characters or what exactly the point of any of their actions was.Here's a tiny example as to not spoil the film;The vampire was apparently looking for one of the characters but when introduced it seemed as though he was just trying to survive.This kind of sums up a lot of the decisions and branches that the story evolves in to, for me.The Delta Blues and Irish folk music were both neat. The film is visually entertaining."

I loved how they incorporated so many different stories of their culture. It was very emotional to see the sacrifices everyone made for both themselves and their loved ones. Additionally, I LOVED the scene where Sammie was singing. It was rich in culture and executed beautifully. That whole scene was so mesmerizing from the moment Sammie started singing down to the dancing, and zoom out of the juke burning. Also, the scenes where smoke & stack were admitting their love to their ladies was so touching. The way they both lowered themselves to properly speak to them as gentlemen was very touching to see because it's rare nowadays."

The film is a cinephiles dream. I was lucky enough to see it in a 70mm IMAX screen and it took my breath away. The movie has so many unexpected moments that take your breath away. The music is unlike anything I've ever heard or seen on film. Coogler took so many risks that paid off in incredible ways. There were a few scenes that gave me literal chills. It is the perfect balance of character development and story. I've seen it 2 times and cannot wait for the 3rd. So many themes and ideas to be discovered that one sitting will not do it justice. The entire cast was tremendous but Jack O'Connel stole the show. Go see this in the biggest screen possible."

          "content": "\"Sinners\" is, without question, one of the top ten films of the decade. The acting strikes a perfect balance between complexity and relatability, with the ever-impressive Michael B. Jordan masterfully filling both of his roles in a way only he can. The plot is so skillfully orchestrated that even if the writers had excluded the vampires entirely, the film would still have been a box-office success.Craftsmanship Beyond the Plot:Beyond the compelling narrative and exceptional acting, every production element shines. The costume design, special effects, soundtrack, and cinematography are all world-class, working together seamlessly to elevate the viewing experience.A Breakout Performance:Miles Caton's breakout role as Sammie Moore was precisely what the film needed. Caton's voice moved not only the characters on screen but also the audience in the theater. During my screening, the family in the row behind me began humming and clapping along as he sang. It takes a rare kind of voice and a truly high-caliber actor to evoke that level of emotional connection.Emotional Resolution:While the resolution of the vampire attack left a bit to the imagination, the scenes that followed more than made up for it, delivering poetic and deeply moving moments that linger long after the credits roll.A Moving Work of Art:The messages woven into Ryan Coogler's masterpiece hardly need to be stated, but it remains extraordinary when an actor of Michael B. Jordan's stature and a director of Coogler's caliber use their platform to release such a powerful, resonant work of art.In summery, \"Sinners\" is a coagulation of all the best possible components of filmmaking."

I spent last ten minutes or so muttering, \"Wrap this up already.\"I'm not sorry I saw SINNERS, but I can't help thinking it could have been better."

          "content": "Taking up what I believe to be counted as good cinema, the main attributes I look for are solid character developments, an investing plot, if I am emotionally shifted and how big an impact the film has left on me. These are things I value personally, it doesn't mean this should be the case for others.Sinners, directed by the incredible Ryan Coogler, is a historic, musical celebration, with a hinge of horror. Following the Smoke&Stack twins, you are inserted in the Mississipi Delta during the Great Depression. While back in their hometown, they set to open their very own Blues\nJoint. In preperation for the big opening, they bring their cousin Sammie Moore, along other people from their cherished past. All is well and goes smoothly until a herd of vampires join the fiesta.I will break the film and my experience down to two parts because at the end of the day it totally felt like two different films. The first part was purely in order to set the tone, the mood and the world we are brought into. A vibe and attitude that each character owns that just work brilliantly.The second part entirely switches our attention to the horror genre. The vampires infiltrating, infesting and shedding havoc on our protagonists. Although tying together the two parts beautifully together and wrapping up the ending in a way I felt satisfied.Michael B. Jordan carries this film with his double performance as the Smoke & Stack twins. Each character is unique and different than the other. You couldn't tell the resemblance. Miles Caton who plays Sammie Moore is also very impressive. He's even more impressive after I have learned that this was his first credit ever.The music and the embodiment of Blues is really the heart and soul of this film leveling up my experience. It nods to a culture who suffered so much during that time and yet somehow by the power of their music achieved fulfillment in happiness. It was celebrated and was brought from the heart.This film was made by a passionate ensemble of artists who didn't care about service or pretentious suphistication or adjustments to society's propaganda but rather on making a great movie, and they have delivered."

Shout out to new comer Miles Caton with his one of a kind baritone voice that doesn't even seem to fit the body it's coming out of. He truly held his own on the big screen. And of course MBJ needs to always play twins because it was impressive and two dapper Jordans are so much better than one."

          "content": "There are so few vampire films out there, and it seems strange as it is an area ripe for the picking. Thankfully, Ryan Coogler identified this gap, and filled it with the absorbing and atmospheric 'Sinners'.I shan't go into too many plot details, as it's a film with a lot of layers and character histories and different plot threads. The main one of course revolves around vampires, but it's almost the stuff outside of that that feels more intriguing. Coogler cooks up a tantalising tale in every respect, and despite feeling perhaps a tad too long, it maintains your attention throughout.The performances from Coogler's muse Michael B Jordan are terrific. He's always magnetic on screen and his acting in this is maybe some of his best, bringing great physicality and drama to his performance. Hailee Steinfeld steals the show with her incredibly fun performance. All of the cast are amazing truth be told.The direction from Coogler is so vivid and energetic. I don't think this is necessarily his best film overall, but I think visually and stylistically it is his best. The way he captures everything, the tone, the score, the costuming, everything comes together perfectly.Hopefully this film kickstarts a resurgence in the vampire genre as it demonstrates how much fun and drama can be had. Coogler nails and this film is thoroughly entertaining and well worth a watch."

I love period pieces and mix that with vampires actually worked. Jordan does well playing both brothers. But the show stealer in my opinion is the head vampire.

However, I did not like the ending. Tommy held on to his broken guitar (the \"sinful\" way of life and what happened that night). And he seemingly faces no consequences for that and it is portrayed as the right option. Maybe he did face consequences(giving up that lifestyle?) but I don't really see it.

          "content": "Sinners is one of those rare surprises that catches you completely off guard. Honestly, I didn't expect much going in - a vampire horror film in 2025? Sounded clichê and a recycled concept. But within minutes, it became clear: this isn't just a vampire movie. It's something far more original.Every single performance in the cast is outstanding. The acting across the board is brilliant, with a level of emotional depth and intensity that pulls you in and never lets go. The filme takes you through the entire emotional spectrum - moments of tension, sorrow, joy, fear, even humour - all executed with surprising finesse. That emotional range feels fresh which is something rare nowadays.Visually, the film is just as impressive. The costumes and set design are stunning. Fully immersing you in the period setting without ever feeling forced or over-stylized. There's a tangible richness in the world-building (even though most of the movie is in the barnhouse) that makes the film feel lived-in and authentic, even as it leans into supernatural territory.One of the most strking things about Sinners is that you simply can't define it totally by one genre. Is it a thriller? A drama? A period piece? A musical? The truth is, it's a bit of everything - and that's its strength. It blends these elements seamlessly, refusing to be boxed in, and the result is something truly unique.But perhaps the most telling sign of its quality: I was never bored. Not once. The pacing is tight, the story constantly evolves, and the film always gives you something to engage with. Sinners is bold, stylish and emotional. It took risks and deserves to be seen, discussed and remembered."

          "content": "There's a lot to love about the movie. Amazing acting. Great music. Good story. Creepy villains. Slow burn of horrors. Plenty of violence and gore. At least, until a somewhat lackluster ending that doesn't bring things together and with the story properly concluding in post-credit scenes.The real star of the movie is the music. It opens talking about the power of music. The most impressive scene is a big blues sequence that conjures spirts of African warriors and modern rappers. It features fantastic choreography and amazing graphics. If anything, it's a shame that with the emphasis placed on music that it doesn't play any kind of role in the finale, being dropped once the blood starts flowing.The actors are all great. Michael B. Jordan does a terrific job as twin brothers. Like Robert Pattinson in Mickey 17, the film does a good job making it feel like two different actors with their own personalities. Delroy Lindo has the funniest moments, often lightening up even the darkest moments. Jack O'Connell is perfectly creepy, playing vampire lord as more cult leader than predator. Miles Caton handles himself well considering this is his first acting role. The rest all do pretty well. Though Wunmi Mosaku's Annie is too often there in the second half just to dump exposition.One of the big problems is the uneven pacing. The first half is character development, a lot of it. It too often drags on and could have been trimmed down. The villain and primary conflict doesn't even show up until the second half, with little build-up. But then once the vampires do show up it takes off never letting up. It keeps building until the explosive finale.But that's the biggest problem. For all the intelligence and meaning the movie has started, it ends with a big brawl. The vampires were smart and conniving before then but suddenly become mere cannon fodder. The greater purpose of music that so much of the film focused on is abandoned as each side physically tears the other apart. It works okay on its own but the previous movie seemed smarter than a mindless brawl.Another issue is that so much doesn't really work towards the story. There's a subplot where the twins have stolen from the Italian and Irish mobs thinking they could get away with it, but nothing ever comes from this. Another is the Klan, which show up after everything to die horribly in a frankly unnecessary epilogue. There's Native Americans hunting the vampires that just disappear and do nothing.The movie has a great premise and set-up, but a poor payoff. It's technically well done. But maybe another script rewrite could have better tied things together."

          "content": "Sinners has some issues. This movie is trying so hard to be From Dusk Till Dawn, but it just comes up short in comparison. The first act involves Michael B. Jordan playing a set of twins as they set up for a party, it's slow and not very interesting. I get technology is getting better, but I don't like one actor playing two sides of a conversation. It's not the Nutty Professor, it never feels fluid, and it's probably why the two main characters spend most of the movie apart. Sinners struggles to get going but once the party starts you think you're in store for some cool vampire fight scenes, but you are mistaken. Instead, vampires dance an Irish Jig that caused the person I was watching the movie with to lean over and say to me \"this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.\" what it didn't have was some cool vampire fights. The action scenes are weak and for a movie that's also weak on character development and plot, you can't afford to also be lackluster with the action. This movie would probably be more fun if you went in blind and didn't know about the genre switch coming your way, but it ruins that with too much foreshadowing early on. Overall, I don't get what all the hype is about 6/10."

          "content": "Film Review: Sinners\nDirected By Ryan Coogler\nScreetime 138 MinutesPlot Summary: Sinners is the tale of three seemingly unrelated people whose paths cross in a small, morally dogmatic town: a struggling single mother, a runaway teen, and a disillusioned priest. Secrets start to come to light as their lives converge, exposing the community's ingrained hypocrisy. The movie examines how each character fights against social pressure, personal guilt, and judgment while facing their past and regaining control over their future.Genre/issues: Sinners explores issues of morality, atonement, societal hypocrisy, and the ambiguities between good and evil in a slow-burning psychological drama with elements of mystery. The movie examines who has the authority to determine what a \"sinner\" actually is and criticizes dogmatic belief systems. It centers the story on human frailties while fusing social realism with religious symbolism.Character Analysis: The priest, who is subtly intensely portrayed by Daniel Grey, experiences the most profound metamorphosis as he struggles with his faith and shortcomings. While the mother, Eva, is grounded but emotionally raw, she symbolizes calm resilience, while the teenage girl, Leah, represents rebellion and the need for truth. The film's emotional heart is driven by the chemistry between each of the well-developed characters.Sound and Cinematography: Sinners has a powerful visual presence. Long, static shots highlight tension and loneliness, while subdued color schemes convey the town's terrible moral atmosphere. The mood is improved by the utilization of natural light and shadows. Silence and background noise are used to create a sense of anxiety in this simple yet powerful sound design. The mainly piano-based score is eerie and subdued.Personal Response:\nSinners is a powerful, contemplative film that lingers after viewing. It asks hard questions and refuses to provide easy answers, which makes it deeply thought-provoking. While its slow pace may not appeal to all viewers, those who appreciate character-driven narratives and moral ambiguity will find it rewarding. It's a timely reminder of the dangers of judgment and the power of compassion."

It is done well but the story doesn't track well. There are visually stimulating parts and some decent acting, but the plot is slow, confusing, and ultimately pointless. The vampire angle is barely used and feels tacked on. The movie wastes its potential and never delivers any real scares or excitement. Overall, Sinners is a boring, disappointing mess that I wouldn't recommend. If another adult recommended this movie to me I would question their life choices... that's what I get for listening to my teenage son. If you do see this... its only and good for the music."

          "content": "After seeing the high scores on IMDB and Rottentomatoes, I decided to go to the cinema and watch this movie. Unfortunately, I left the cinema feeling completely dissapointed and annoyed. This has got to be -hands down- the dumbest script written in the past 5 years.Why is it so stupid? Well, because of the following:1. Nothing happens for at least hour and a half. Like, absolutely nothing. They are just walking around and talking to people. None of the interaction matters.2. The, uuhhm, love making scenes are really uncomfortable to watch. There are three of them. The first takes you by surprise, where the main character doggy styles his ex, in broad daylight right in the middle of her shop, where only second ago she had kids as customers. In the second one, another main character goes down on the lady he like, even though she says \"I need to freshen up, I have been sweating all day\". His response \"I want to taste you\". Iewww. In the last love scene, the girl drools and spits in the main characters mouth, and he LOVES it.3. The first vampire shows up after an hour or so. He is flying in broad daylight, and only has mild burns. He takes refuges in the home of unsuspecting victims. When his chasers (some native Americans) come along, they quickly decide that night is falling and they need to head home. For real? So, they have been chasing him all day, he is the last remaining vampire, and instead of preventing the spread, they go home for supper? What?4. The vampires are absolutely covered in blood when they attack, yet they are clean as a whistle every single time they interact with our main characters. No blood on their faces or on their clothes, nothing, not even a drop.5. One of the main characters is a musical wizzard. Suddenly musicians and dancers from all cultures and timelines show up and start singing and jamming. Nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care.6. The vampires are pretty much singing and dancing like 50% of their onscreen time.7. One vampire has been invited into the \"club\" already and the other one has been killed inside. Yet neither is willing or able to enter again. Maybe they forgot they could come inside anyway?8. Once all the vampires are invited in by the angry Asian lady, they attack one by one. Like in the good old-fashioned Kung Fu movies. Hundreds of vampires are pretty much standing around, waiting till one is killed before the other moves in.9. The vampires bite a lot, yet the victims wounds each time appear to be small wounds.10. Our main hero literally comes out of the blue to impale the boss vampire. Like, one scene he is inside the burning barn, the next scene has has somehow avoided hundreds of vampires and ended up right behind the boss with a wooden stake in his hand. In the meanwhile, all other vampires are just standing there, watching.11. All vampires are just standing around and waiting for the the sun to rise. They all burn to a crisp in seconds.12. The vampire that was able to fly in broad daylight, turns into a blazing fire when the first ray of sun touches him, even though he is standing up to his belly in water.13. For no reason whatsoever, the KKK shows up at the barn. Even though it was on fire just one scene ago, it is in perfect conditions now. Also, no ashed or charred bodies outside. Everything as clean as a whistle.14. It ends with a post-credit scene, where it appears two vampires survived, because they escaped. Like, how can hundreds of vampires be burned to a crisp by the first ray of sun, and these two can escape even though they are in the middle of nowhere.15. The main character shoots two guys in broad daylight in the middle of a busy street. He talks to them, then he proceeds to do his groceries. Nobody panicks, nobody calls the police. The bystanders simply start whispering racial slurs.16. In the final (and only) battle, even though the vampires greatly outnumber their victims (5 living, at least 100 vampires), they suddenly retreat because reasons.I could go on and on about how poorly written and executed this movie was, but I will stop at this point. I only get angry thinking about wasting my time and money on this terrible movie."

Nothing particularly stands out in a way that would make me want to watch this again.Plot:\nSet in the 1930's, the plot centers around twins Smoke & Stack (both played by Michael B Jordan), gangsters who have returned to their hometown in Mississippi from Chicago. The twins hope to use their acquired wealth to set up a dance club. They loop in their musically talented cousin as well as other friends to help with the set up. Un beknown to them, certain music attracts vampires, who are hell bent on turning all human beings into vampires.Acting:\nThe acting quality is generally pretty good with Michael B Jordan in particular putting in a good shift. However, it isn't anything to really write home about.Conclusion:\nA good watch, you'll enjoy it if you like monster movies, but don't go in with sky high expectations.6/10."

I loved how they tried to mix a vampire thriller with the Jim Crow era, but it ended up being a cringy wannabe monster movie. While I do think that the writing felt cringey and out of place at times, I do think that Ryan Coogler did a great job bringing this idea to life and created a realistic setting that sucked me into the time and place that this film was set in. The last thing I will say is that it felt unnecessary for Michael B to play two roles in this movie, don't get me wrong he did great but it still felt like a cheap trick. Overall I think this movie was intriguing but underwhelming."

          "content": "By Ian Chandler - May 9, 2025Sinners is a film that I did not expect to see. Friends of mine wanted to watch it; so, I thought it'd be a fun way to kill two hours with them. It is worth noting that I view gory monster movies as an overly tired trope. In other words, I didn't expect very much from this picture. Well, I am pleased to say that I can see why this movie got the word-of-mouth it did. It is a great period thriller with memorable characters and good use of metaphorical imagery. Though I still have some issues with it, I'd say that Ryan Coogler's Sinners won me over.The first major aspect about this film is its casting. The actors' performances are quite exceptional, and they might be the best part about this wicked feature. Michael B. Jordan plays two roles in this film, and even though it takes adjusting to distinguish the two, both of his characters have interesting backgrounds and traits. But the biggest surprise was Miles Canton. The kid is only twenty years old, yet he is able to match with the bigger league actors throughout the entire time! I'd like to see him in future projects, as he has a lot of potential.The plot is mostly good, as it is consistent and overall engaging. However, if you are one that tries to guess its outcomes, you will most likely succeed. Sinners is largely predictable, which unfortunately kills much of the tension once the tale goes haywire. If you even recall certain parts of earlier scenes, the questions shift from \"How will this happen?\" to \"When will this happen?\" Even so, strong acting and a great setting keeps the whole endeavor entrancing.Sinners also contains some vivid sequences, abundant with metaphors and surrealism. Most notably, it uses music to tell some of its story. A few moments do hinder the 1930s atmosphere that Sinners expertly crafted beforehand; but it is, thankfully, easy to get sucked back into Coogler's weird world once the stranger scenes end. The film gains more from these imaginative ideas than it loses. And, in an environment where IPs are encouraged more than creativity, it's always nice to see something new, regardless of its execution.While Sinners isn't my favorite film this year, this is a despicably good watch. The acting is nearly flawless, the period detail is above average, and the directing is very focused. Though Coogler needs more films under his belt before being ranked with Nolan, Scorsese, and Cameron, his non-IP film debut indicates that he is a director worth keeping eyes on. This film is clearly enhanced at the theater too, so please catch it while it is still playing. It is a good reminder of what the cinema experience is supposed to be.Score: 76/100Summary: Sinners' biggest sin is its rather predictable narrative. Despite this, it remains a passionate film, showcasing considerable talent across all departments."

          "content": "There is a temptation to compare this film to From Dusk Till Dawn. However, Sinners is a superior creation is almost every way.Set in the deep south USA during the 1930s, two black twins Smoke & Stack (both played by Michael B Jordan) set up a Blues club using their ill-gotten money from Chicago. However, the arrival of a trio of vampires causes the night to take a much bloodier turn.So what makes this film so good. For a start, the first half is spent entirely setting the scene; we get to know the characters, their lives, what drives them. The world that they live is in brought vibrantly to life. It feels real and dynamic.When the bad stuff happens, the characters act sensibly and believably. There are no acts of sheer stupidity to create peril (arguably there is one, but it is driven by a realistically portrayed amount of grief and fear).The cinematography is bold and masterful. Notice the number of long tracking shots, without cuts. For example, following a character from one store, across the busy street, into another store and then back again.And then there is the music. I am not a fan of blues, but it fits the tone of this film perfectly. The scene at the club where the music reaches into the past and the future is a visual and audio feast. The choreography must have been a nightmare (see the bit above about long continuous shots).The performances are uniformly excellent. Jordan is arguably the lead, but in reality this is an ensemble film. All combined, this elevates the film above what could easily have been a generic schlock-horror flick.Ultimately, you can view this as a film about the power of music, or community, or oppression (or freedom), or family. But really, I think that this it is all of these things, and therefore it is a film about life."

The concept behind the conclusion lacks the depth seen earlier in the film, and the performances in those moments fall flat. Moreover, the visual effects, while serviceable, are modest and do not rise to the level expected for a film of this scale. Despite its powerful buildup, the film ultimately stumbles at the finish line."

          "content": "I've seen this before. Two different stories combined in one movie. Full Metal Jacket, Predator, or in this case: From Dusk Till Dawn.The first half was great. A little slow but the character development was thick, direction was excellent, and the soundtrack murdered... then comes the vampires.Unlike FDTD, the second half of Sinners does not deliver. There was no intense theatrics of building booby-traps and weapons; only a quick-and-lame scene of sharpening chair legs, and oh yeah, \"hey, eat this garlic so we know you aren't a vampire.\"\nCoogler really missed the mark with using the character of the pastor's son. He could have contributed to the survival of the group; by somehow choosing to side with Christianity over music, and I don't know, maybe use a crucifix or something to fight off the undead? The would have really enriched the characters arc. Instead, he just stood mindlessly in the background with a guitar in his hand... the whole damn time.One thing I couldn't shake, was the inconsistency. So you have to invite the vampires in the residence or else they can't enter. Except for: at the climax of the movie when they all enter without being invited. Once they do, the death scenes are chaotic, and yes, inconsistent. Like, for instance, why did the vampires withdraw out the building once the protagonist shoves a stake in the heart of his girlfriend (after being bitten)??The ending was also interesting to say the least. After defeating the vampires, by sneaking up behind the main vamp and stabbing him in the back right before the sun rises (yeah, that's right;) the protagonist ensues a gun fight with who else? The Ku Klux Klan. You can't make this up.That being said, the acting was great. Michael Jordan does great playing two different characters, and all of the female characters were performed magnificently. But the real masterpiece of this movie was brilliant soundtrack."

Some of whom are more than what they seem,,,The setting is 1930s Mississippi Delta. Jim Crow laws rule the South, and there are cotton fields as far as the eye can see. As the sun comes over the horizon, each field can be seen filled with black people picking cotton. One of those just happens to be the son of a local pastor, named Sammie Moore.Sammie is a young blues man, and\ncan practically make his guitar talk. He dreams of a life beyond the cotton fields, and longs to play for people all over the Delta & beyond. His father continuously tries to dissuade his son from following that passion. Telling him that playing blues music in joints throughout the Delta will bring him nothing but misery. Even going so far as to say, \"you go out chasin' the devil, and one night he gonna follow you home.\"Next, we meet the Twin brothers, and WWI vets, Smoke & Stack (Sammie's older cousins). Both of whom left home 7 yrs ago and went to work for Al Capone in Chicago, hoping to gain power & money while learning from the crime kingpin. Eventually, the twins learned that Chicago wasn't so different from their home, and they were just two expendable n-words, helping another white man get rich. So they decide to head home and open up their own juke joint. A place where musicians like Sammie and other Delta folk like him could bring their music to the people, and the twins can reap the rewards.So Smoke & Stack return to Mississippi, and they acquire a vacant building to set up shop. They also make their presence known to the locals (none of whom have forgotten the Moore twins), and acquire local talent for their opening night (one of whom being their little cousin Sammie).That evening, as the sun sets on the Mississippi Delta and the Moore family sets up their new establishment for opening night, a certain kind of evil shows it's face in their town. An evil that is being drawn to a certain kind of sound being played.Now, onto what I thought,,,Coogler really brought us something special here! I wouldn't say it's perfect, but dang!! It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It's ART!! So much more than just a horror movie.The cast is really spectacular. Jordan excels in his dual role as the Moore twins Smoke & Stack. I don't see his momentum as a leading man going away anytime soon. I have loved Hailee Steinfeld ever since I saw her in PP2, but she brings a whole new level in her performance here. I cannot remember the actor who played the lead vamps name, but he needs to get a lot of work stat. He's a great antagonist.The supporting cast were also incredible (just don't know their names), especially the young guy who played Sammie (and I especially liked the very special guest who portrayed the older version of Sammie at the end of the movie).8.2 rating (imo) at least."

          "content": "Sinners (2025) :\nMovie Review -Group dynamics haven't been explored much in vampire stories over the years, so this film offers something refreshingly new in that sense. The true blue-and-red vampire formula began with the silent masterpiece Nosferatu (1922), followed by what many consider the best talkie vampire film, Vampyr (1932). Sinners doesn't shy away from borrowing from these classics and then cleverly injects a layer of group conflict to create a modern horror experience. Though set in the 1930s, the film carries enough weight and relevance to feel more modern than many so-called \"new era\" horror movies. By evil's grace, it has its flaws-but they don't derail the film. It remains a well-plotted, well-executed horror film, even if its 2-hour runtime feels a bit stretched.Identical criminal twins, Smoke and Stack (both played by Michael B. Jordan), return to Mississippi to open a juke joint and make money. Their cousin Sammie (Miles Caton) joins them, despite his pastor father's warnings that his music invites devils. On opening night, Sammie's singing mesmerizes the crowd-but as his father predicted, it also draws demonic attention. An Irishman-turned-vampire, along with a couple he killed, arrives at the joint but isn't allowed in because they're white. However, Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), Stack's ex-girlfriend, steps out and is attacked. She's turned into a vampire and gains entry, triggering a terrifying night. Will the group be able to fight back?The storyline, as described, is familiar to most vampire films, except for the added elements of group dynamics and racial tension rooted in old America. This gives the film a fresh angle, although it still follows outdated tropes that made sense in the 1930s and 1940s. For instance, using guns and bullets on vampires despite knowing they're ineffective-either the characters are stupid, or the film assumes the audience is. Stack and his girlfriend's subplot lacks depth, and the same goes for Sammie's minor love story. Smoke's marriage also adds little to the narrative. These three couples feature some sensual moments that are steamy but lack theoretical sense. Only about 30 minutes of the film genuinely deliver horror; the remaining hour and a half is where the film feels overlong. Had it been trimmed to 90-100 minutes, I'd have fewer complaints. Nevertheless, the gripping storytelling and cinematic flair help you overlook many of its shortcomings.Michael B. Jordan performs both roles impressively, and Miles Caton fits perfectly as young Sammie. Despite a weakly written character, Hailee Steinfeld works wonders with her screen presence-perhaps because she's the only white woman in the cast, which makes her stand out visually. Jack O'Connell surprises with his chilling portrayal, while Wunmi Mosaku brings another layer of acting excellence to the ensemble. Supporting performances from Omar Miller, Delroy Lindo, Lola Kirke, Peter Dreimanis, Jayme Lawson, Li Jun Li, Yao (as Bo Chow), Saul Williams, and others round out the strong cast.Sinners isn't a high-budget production, so the visuals are somewhat lacking. They aren't particularly scary, and the gore can feel childish at times. However, the technical aspects are solid. The background score is effective, and the editing improves significantly in the second half. Cinematography and production design range from decent to okay. Ryan Coogler has written a simple script, but makes sure that his presentation elevates it on the big screen. Yes, Sinners has its share of jump scares, crafted with cinematic sensibility. Take Mary's scene, for instance-she walks away from the vampire, and just as he leaps at her, the frame cuts to the bar interior with a scream, smoothly transitioning between parallel scenes. Similarly, the same background music elevates both a party sequence and a sex scene, fitting both moments seamlessly. These little nuances make Sinners more worthwhile than its script alone would suggest. As a whole, this dark tale of sin is a must-watch for anyone who loves horror cinema.RATING - 6/10*"

          "content": "Michael B. Jordan is \"Smoke\" and twin brother \"Stack\" in this classy drama of a pair who've lived on the wrong side of the tracks for most of their lives, but have determined to go home and try to go straight. To that end, they buy an old barn and hope to set up their own speakeasy - with only a nominal nod to prohibition - pumping to the rafters with dancing and blues music. On the way, they ally with talented musician \"Sammie\" (Miles Caton) and, of course, there's a bit of baggage for the siblings as they return to a town that's not altogether welcoming. Once home, a mixture of confidence, threats and collective charisma succeeds in assembling a crowd for their opening night. Pretty swiftly, though, that grand celebration attracts the attention of some travellers who are keen to join the party, but perhaps in true Charlie Daniels style, they have an altogether more menacing agenda. This is the cinematic equivalent of an LP, this film. It starts with one side gradually introducing us a rich collection of characters all of whom could quite plausibly have lived in Mississippi at a time when segregation was as rife as illicit booze, and the two more recently hailing from Chicago gives things a certain gangster element too. There is also a very subtly powerful effort from Hailee Steinfield as \"Mary\" too. The flip side of the record proceeds to develop some elements of peril with the story, and that's where it rather runs out of steam for me. It tries very hard to create a sense of hot, sweaty and frenzied jeopardy, but maybe because it has already taken quite a long time to get to this stage, that all comes across as a bit rushed and lacking in punch. It looks great, the visual effects are convincing enough and the production design smoulders perfectly. In the end, though, whilst it proves that MBJ is comfortably able to hold a story, Ryan Coogler has overly relied on a marvellously toe-tapping musical score that has been left to do much of the heavy lifting. That latter point is made more essential by a mediocre audio mix that can make the dialogue quite difficult to make out more often than I'd have liked. This seems to be an increasing issue as directors become more ambitious with their visual aspirations leaving the one thing that cannot be readily faked/augmented - the sound - left at the altar. It's a cinema film, and will look distinctly average on a television so big screen and soundtrack audio is essential to get the best from this silky looking story with an interesting twist at the end, and again at the very end."

Along the way, they run across Sammie (Miles Caton), a talented blues guitarist on his own personal journey of discovery. However, the brothers will find themselves in a reckoning with a malevolent evil force, in the shape of Remmick (Jack O' Connoll.)In an era where black horror, and the social implications in their narrative, are enjoying a rightful place in the cultural zeitgeist, writer/director Ryan Coogler has delivered a lengthy period piece that has developed some critical and commercial success. With lead star Jordan taking on duel lead roles, it's an ambitious undertaking in a film that doesn't seem bound by genre conventions. Judging by the other reviews, there seems to be some divided opinion on the film, and this may be one of the less favourable ones.For the first part, the film seems to be on a mission to bore you to death, lacking a fixed, focused story to flow from, and creating an uninvolving experience, lacking coherency and terribly uneven. It feels largely more comedic in tone than unnerving, and takes too long to get to this segment, with a lot of meaningless exposition that clogs everything up. Jack O' Connoll is wasted as the demon force, most striking in an Irish song and dance sequence, much like Caton during a liquor house jamboree, where black music throughout the generations fuses together in a stylised overload. There's a deep, profound message under the surface, but the material just puts you off.By the end, a deep over-indulgence has set in, carrying on even after the end credits have started rolling, with something relevant to the story, but dragging on and testing your patience. There seems to be some deep divided opinion going on, but sadly mine falls in the less favourable. **"

I saw a ton of advertisements for this movie as well as reviews of those that had seen it before me and we decided to go check it out. This is the same director, Ryan Coogler, that teamed with Michael B. Jordan and directed Fruitvale Station ,Creed, Black Panther, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. And now he directed this masterpiece known as Sinners. Something else that stood out to me was the role/greatness of the music in the film. Although this whole film is a cinematic masterpiece, there are two scenes (not going to spoil it) that I saw and I was like \"Whoa\". Not going to be another great horror movie like this for a while. I may even go see it again. It's a definite recommend and if you haven't seen it go check it out! Oh, and make sure to stay all the way through the end of the credits!"

Set in 1932 Mississippi, the film follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack, portrayed by Michael B.

Ludwig Göransson's score, infused with blues and gospel influences, elevates the storytelling, creating an immersive experience that resonates deeply.Sinners stands out not only for its compelling story and performances but also for its celebration of Black culture and resilience. In an era where such representation is vital, this film serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of diverse voices in cinema.For those seeking a film that combines genre-defying storytelling with profound cultural insights, Sinners is an essential watch."

The transition between IMAX and 1.43:1 aspect ratio is so smooth and the part when they slowly widen the screen, omg it so smooooooooth. The soundtrack is top notch, got me listen to it all the way home.The SCORE is godly. Ludwig did it again. It's so visceral and I'm so happy with it. Michael b jordan the man you are. His delivery of the smokestack twins and their complexity is amazing to watch. Although i don't want to play favourites, annie has my heart. Seeing a full-bodied black woman comfortable in her skin, no doubt beautiful and graceful, play smoke's love interest was SO refreshing. She was a female character written AND casted right. The plot feels like such a well-packaged gift full of history references, carefully crafted characters, emotional depth, and thematically rich cultural storytelling."

Set in 1930s Mississippi, the film follows twin brothers, both played with remarkable nuance by Michael B. Jordan, as they try to build a better life and end up facing bloodsuckers both literal and societal. Coogler balances moody horror with pointed social commentary, turning every moonlit juke joint into a battleground for the soul of the South.The film's rich character work, especially Jordan's dual performance and a breakout turn by Miles Katen as blues prodigy Sammie, gives Sinners its emotional teeth. Autumn Durald Arkapaw's cinematography casts a hypnotic spell, while the blues-heavy score hums with sorrow and soul. It's more than just style, Coogler's script uses vampirism as a metaphor for racial oppression, making Sinners as intellectually sharp as it is visually arresting.Yes, the trailer gave away a bit too much (seriously, Hollywood-stop spoiling Act 2!), but the payoff still stuns. Sinners demands your attention.Troy Hill Talks."

          "content": "As much as the vampire subgenre has been overdone over the last few decades, there's still fresh and new stories to take it. One such example is Ryan Coogler's newest directorial endeavor, Sinners, which focuses on twin brothers returning to their hometown to start over again. With this premise in tact, one might not even know that the Moore brothers would soon be encountering supernatural forces. It should be safe to say that this movie eases you into the horror seamlessly rather than throwing you under the curveball immediately.Much of Sinners is carried by Michael B. Jordan in the dual roles of Smoke and Stack, giving each brother their own distinct personality that contrast them uniquely from one another. Seeing each brother run business their own way, be it making deals downtown or finding methods to run their juke joint, allows for the right amount of time to get to know them through and through. Seeing Jordan bouncing off of his dual role so naturally makes it hard to believe that it wasn't only him playing both characters. Some of their most earnest scenes come from their interactions with their cousin Sammie, an aspiring musician who ends up playing a big role in the movie's central role of music bringing people together harmoniously. In addition, Hailee Steinfeld is well cast as Stack's white passing ex-girlfriend Mary, along with Delroy Lindo as the elderly yet stubborn pianist Delta Slim, Wunmi Mosaku as Smoke's hoodoo pro wife Annie, and more. The entire cast match each role they play so well within this narrative, and seeing their characters go down differing paths ups the suspense that much more.Going beyond the cast, the actual horror showcased here is a solid blending of traditional vampire myth with some modern twists. Alongside vampire's weakness to garlic, getting killed by wooden stakes or needing to be invited inside, the lead vampire's own motivation to turn everyone, including African Americans, is quite fascinating given the film's early '30s time period. One could feel a sense of dread and wonderment with said vampire's purpose to consume that could actually be plausible if these blood sucking souls existed back in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi. And even beyond the horror elements, Sinners is a surprisingly well crafted musical, which features numerous blues genres performed by various musicians and the cast. Along with the gospel oldie This Little Light of Mine being used as a musical motif throughout the picture, various other songs fit the characters within their environments and also pay tribute to various black musicals throughout the decades. Along with Ludwig Goransson's triumphant score, the soundtrack of Sinners slaps harder than one might think on first impact.By blending the horror and musical genres seamlessly in a creative manner, Ryan Coogler's Sinners is a truly delightful surprise of the year. It's rare to see films like this that are as invested in the genre storytelling it's tackling as its many individual characters and impeccable time period. This is a feature worth going out of your way to see regardless of your personal opinions on period pieces or vampire lore, and a stealthy reminder that Coogler is one of the finest directors working today."

On it's surface, this movie offers all the nuts and bolts of a typically entertaining movie (action, lore etc) but it's true essence lies beneath it's many substantive layers. Most prominently, the film functions as an allegorical mirror or lens through which culture, race and humanity are reflected and examined. In this regard, the film offers a loquacious commentary on human nature, race relations, cultural identity, love, relationships, freedom and identity.P. S~ In rebuttal to the commentary that this film 'copies' it's predecessors: I would argue that Sinners differs from it's prior inspirational works concerning it's greater depth, nuance, substance, social commentary, messaging and or historical storytelling."

The first half is largely character building, but rest assured the second half payoff is well worth it.Sinners is another filmmaking masterclass from Ryan Coogler, as he delivers phenomenal visuals, unbearable tension and outright frightening horror as the club of 'sinners' begin to realise what is happening.Jordan delivers a reliable performance as the twins, still on his way to superstar status, but it is the red hot charisma of the leading ladies led by Steinfeld and Lawson who shamelessly steal the film out from under him.

One of them is a cool tough guy and the other is a cool kind of funny guy. For about an hour we follow them just doing stuff, meanwhile they are about to make sammie, their cousin, a blues star and have a party. That's about everything that's going on for more than half of the movie.They touch a lot of themes i can't even remember, but never expand on any of them. It feels like it tries to be a lot of things but ends up being none, going all over the place. I kind of lost interest very early.Then at the party they just have some fun and a weird scene that serves no purpose, it features music that blends black music from all decades and features characters dressed like they're from different decades. It was a nice idea generally but serves no purpose in the film and just exists to be there.Then we have basic vampire stuff, one brother gets infected etc, etc, nothing special there.The visuals, effects and fight scenes are nice.Overall we get a very very basic vampire movie plot every kid could come up with, but with a lot of stuff around it that has no purpose and makes up the bulk of the film. Just rambling and going around. Have we watched the same movie?Btw i was baffled by michael b jordan having a fade haircut, i wouldnt buy him being a guy from the 2000's let alone 1932!!!

Jordan's breathtaking performance playing both twins with such nuance and emotional intensity that you forget you're watching the same actor.The symbolism woven throughout the film is stunning. From the use of mirrors and reflections to the recurring motifs of fire and water, every element serves a deeper purpose. Coogler doesn't just tell a story he builds a world where guilt, identity, and redemption are tangible forces. The twins are not simply two characters, they're two halves of a fractured whole, representing the inner battle between darkness and light, trauma and healing.Jordan's dual performance is nothing short of astonishing. He gives each brother a distinct emotional landscape one simmering with quiet torment, the other unraveling in controlled chaos. Watching them confront each other is like watching a man wrestle with his own soul. It's raw, poetic, and deeply human.Sinners is not just a film it's a mirror. It holds up difficult questions about morality, accountability, and forgiveness, and forces us to look inward. The cinematography is rich, the pacing deliberate, and the message profound. Ryan Coogler has once again proven that cinema can be both art and awakening. For me, Sinners isn't just the best movie of 2025 so far it's a defining work of the decade."

This left a hollowness in its wake that felt like a missed opportunity.Beyond its larger gaping flaws, an issue no less deserving of mention is the excessive explicit material that adds nothing to the story, but will be sure to add discomfort and or disgust in its audience members.I have never watched a film that came so close to greatness, and instead self-sabotages."

At first, I wasn't sure if I would wind up watching it, but the more I heard, the greater it sounded.Of Ryan Coogler, I didn't have any strong previous opinion. He directed the Creed films (unseen by me) and Marvel's Black Panther, which, shoddy rhino VFX or not, is one of the more colorful MCU films and certainly one that managed to reach beyond the usual Marvel audience in an entirely new way -- its Afrofuturism giving black viewers representation of a sort that Hollywood had never previously achieved.Even so, Coogler wasn't entirely \"free\" with Black Panther. (In my review of its sequel, Wakanda Forever, I argued that the film is an example of an artist trying to make art under a studio that won't seem to let him -- a serious euology for Chadwick Boseman forced to double as a sneak pilot for a Disney+ show about \"what if Iron Man was a teen girl\".) With Sinners, he is untrammeled, and there is no doubt that he is one of the Millennial greats.Set in 1937, in Jim Crow Mississippi, the tale follows the Smokestack twins, Elijah \"Smoke\" and Elias \"Stack\" Moore, both played by Michael B. Jordan (in some very well done duplication VFX), as they return from Chicago, having worked a lucrative job for the mafia, to spend their new fortune on a juke joint for black persons only. They convince their young cousin \"Preacher Boy\" Sammie (Miles Caton) to join in the project as their blues guitarist, and a grouchy old pianist named Delta Slim (a phenomenal Delroy Lindo) and an aspiring singer named Pearline (Jayme Lawson) are also brought in as performers.They're also joined by an imposingly sized field worker (Omar Miller), Smoke's spiritually in-tune ex-wife (Wunmi Mosaku), two Chinese shopkeepers (Li Jun Li and Yao), and Stack's \"half-black\" old flame played by Hailee Steinfeld, who provides some of the funniest line deliveries in the film. However, evil forces also move towards the juke joint; a group of bloodthirsty vampires led by Irish immigrant Remmick (Jack O'Connell, another awesome performance) move through Mississippi and make a stop when Sammie's music makes the fabric of reality dance and catches their attention.It's an electrifying thriller -- with effective fight scenes and another thunderous score from Ludwig Göransson -- that gives us something to think about; even if you aren't a thinkpiece writer, you will likely notice something about how these particular monsters are used and what their existence may represent. The first vampires we see are white people; the very first appears to be a victim/ghost of Irish colonialism, who tries to sell the black folk -- and their Chinese immigrant friends -- at the juke bar on a sort of false \"coexistence\". A tweet from Jillian Chili describes it as a clash of \"two marginalized groups\" that \"have differences in the ideology of freedom, with one continuing the vicious cycle of its oppressors disguised as empathy\".In addition to its themes of racism, culture, and spirituality, its strongest theme is of course music -- the expression of it and the powers that may come with said expression, provided the right sound is created at the right moment with the right level of frankness.An opening narration describes various types of music from around the globe that are \"so true that they pierce the veil between life and death\" and have the capacity to summon spirits from both the past and the future. This is visualized in a later scene that made me feel untethered from my own time and space, just as the characters seemed to be from theirs. Even if you're not the sort of person who believes in spiritual experiences, cinema (as Sinners proves) is the medium that can give them to us -- or, if you're a believer, make them more real than they ever were. (The auditorium I watched this in has a pretty stellar sound system, but I do believe that Sinners is best experienced, most probably, in IMAX.)I was admittedly a bit disappointed that a few plot threads, e.g. The Native American policemen (or are they vampire hunters?), didn't go anywhere, and I sort of understand people who were perplexed by the ending, even though I believe it works well thematically. (I'll try not to give too much away, for now.) All the same, this is a stirring and often hilarious film with superb musical sequences, first-rate costumes courtesy of Ruth E. Carter, and great performances all around.And if somehow this isn't doing it for you, see the film for its horniness. To paraphrase a friend, it may the horniest film to feature basically no nudity whatsoever."

Despite enjoying it, I was surprised about how traditional some of the middle section was.Having been in Chicago, twin brothers Elijah \"Smoke\" Moore (Michael B Jordan) and Elias \"Stack\" Moore (Michael B Jordan) return to Clarkside, Mississippi, where they grew up, with plans to open a Juke Joint for the local community. They recruit several old friends to help them with opening night, in particular their cousin Sammie (Miles Caton) who plays blues guitar with extraordinary skill and soul. His music though, is powerful and draws the attention of a dangerous otherworldly threat.There is so much extraordinary about \"Sinners\" that I feel I need to make sure that, despite my one criticism being much more specific, it doesn't carry the same weight as the praise. Performances are excellent, maybe even everything in the film. Michael B Jordan's charismatic, though often violent and unrepenting, leads are wonderful. Wunmi Musaku delivers all the exposition but in a way that (just about) holds everything together. Hailee Steinfeld is perhaps the most charismatic actress working today. I've been dying for Jack O' Connell to play something other than a self-destructive psychopath in something and it's perhaps ironic that this is the role that sees him do that. The music scenes are some of the most excellent crafted aspects of the film, with some of the most unexpected moments.The criticism I have is that once the threat is revealed properly and the attack begins, it's got mostly the same sort of story beats that all films in this particular subgenre tend to have. There's not much playing with the formula inherent with those characters nor the action beats involved.Which is not to say that I didn't like it, I absolutely did - I just perhaps thought that Ryan Coogler might have found a little more to do with the tropes, once we were there."

The turn from crime drama to thriller horror happens amidst a mesmerising scene filled with music, soul, love, debauchery, violence, betrayal and freedom. After this turning point, thrilling performances from Michael B. Jordan, Jack O'Connell, and co. Ensure that the film manages to steer just clear of cheesy monster flick and remain a psychological thriller in which the grey are between right and wrong is blurred and the choices of the characters (who perpetually populate said grey area) are unpredictable and exciting.

So Coogler's joined the IMAX-65mm ranks of Christopher Nolan, Damien Chazelle, Jordan Peele and even Michael Bay. It's nice seeing modern Hollywood talents still utilising 70mm celluloid in an increasingly homogenised industry honing in on mostly digital cameras and projection. Honestly more filmmakers should be utilising BOTH digital and analogue film cameras. Regardless, Sinners is an achievement of genre fusion and a technical treasure too, thanks to it be in an inevitable IMAX-darling for future re-releases.It's not all that often where a great director gets to sign off on a passion project that's NOT based off any iconic books or IP, and considering Sinners cost near $100-million to make, it's heartwarming to know the film's also become a hit and might become something of a 'four-quadrant' film in the years to come. The whole 'we want original films' cry so many audience members make to Hollywood isn't just hyperbole: Sinners shows that when done right, it's like an overdue reward for something we didn't know we wanted in the first place.Sinners gets 4.5/5 stars. 9/10 IMDbs. Easily one of the year's strongest films."

Set against the backdrop of Jim Crow era Mississippi, this film draws you in from the first moment with the story of Smoke & Stack, two twin brothers who have recently returned home from a foray into the Chicago Gangland, and are looking to settle down back in their hometown. As always, Michael B. Jordan is fantastic! It must have been a lot of fun for him to find the different character arcs of the identical brothers, and he doesn't squander the opportunity, making both of them distinct individuals. The ensemble cast are all excellent and do a marvelous job of making their mark on the story. The only minor complaint I had was that the run time was a hair too long and made it drag a bit heading into the climax. That didn't detract from the movie and I was able to mostly stay engaged throughout. Overall, Ryan Coogler did an outstanding job with an entirely fresh take on the vampire genre while still telling a better than the average monster movie story. It isn't often that a film lives up to its hype in every way, but Sinners definitely earned it all."

          "content": "Review Essay: Sinners - Where the Blues Bleed and Vampires Don't Sparkle\"I didn't know the blues could kill.\" That's the thought that lingers long after the credits roll in Sinners, a film that defies expectation and genre convention in equal measure. With its soul-soaked soundtrack and a narrative steeped in pain, redemption, and haunting violence, Sinners is not your typical vampire movie. It's a slow-burning tale that uses bloodsuckers as a lens through which to explore deeper human suffering and spiritual decay-where damnation doesn't come only with fangs, but also with a guitar riff.At its heart, Sinners is a gothic southern tragedy, weaving the mythology of vampires into the gritty realism of the American South. The story centers on a traveling blues musician who harbors a dark secret: he is undead, cursed to roam from town to town feeding on blood-and regret. But unlike the glamorous or grotesque depictions we've come to associate with the vampire genre, the protagonist here is not a predator in control, but a man barely holding on, both literally and figuratively. His victims are chosen with grim deliberation, not lust. He feeds not out of pleasure, but out of necessity and despair.What truly sets Sinners apart is its soundtrack, which plays as much of a role in the storytelling as the script itself. The blues in this film is not background music-it is a character, a driving force, and, in many ways, a form of confession. Each song underscores the mood and inner turmoil of the characters. The aching slide guitars and weathered vocals echo the main character's eternal suffering. It's music that mourns and condemns in equal measure.The direction is meditative and unhurried, allowing moments to breathe and emotions to simmer. This pacing may not appeal to fans of fast-cut horror or jump scares, but it rewards patience with rich atmosphere and emotional weight. The cinematography leans heavily into shadow and light, using decaying churches, neon-soaked motels, and moonlit bayous to frame the film's spiritual desolation. The result is a visual aesthetic that feels more like a Southern Gothic painting than a horror set piece.In terms of storytelling, Sinners succeeds by grounding its supernatural elements in very human pain. The vampire trope is used not just for horror, but as a metaphor for addiction, loneliness, and spiritual corruption. The protagonist is less a monster and more a man cursed with endless consequences. The film's moral compass spins not around good and evil, but around guilt and repentance. There are no easy answers here, only questions about what it means to live-and what it means to keep living when you no longer deserve to.The supporting cast delivers restrained but powerful performances, particularly a young woman who becomes entangled in the vampire's life and serves as a mirror to his fading humanity. Their relationship is tinged with both danger and tenderness, and never settles into predictable territory. There is love, but not romance; connection, but not salvation.It's important to note that Sinners isn't a film for everyone. Its melancholy tone, poetic dialogue, and genre-bending ambition might alienate those expecting traditional vampire thrills. But for viewers willing to let the story unfold like a blues ballad-slow, sorrowful, and filled with emotional nuance-the film offers a rare and resonant experience.In a cinematic landscape crowded with vampire clichés, Sinners dares to be different. It strips the myth of its glamour and returns it to something raw, spiritual, and painfully human. And yes-apparently, the blues can kill. But in this film, they also reveal, redeem, and remember.---"

Coogler has risen in esteem relatively quickly in Hollywood and with the public at large with only 4 films under his belt as a director prior to 'Sinners'. Along with Jordan Peele he is one of the few African American directors whose name alone moves the needle as far as whether or not a picture is successful. He is quickly elevating to a status occupied by some of the most successful and respected directors making movies today such as James Cameron and Christopher Nolan. After the success of his two 'Black Panther' films as well as the 'Creed' franchise that he started Coogler was able to pick just about any project he wanted. With 'Sinners' he comes back to an original concept with a horror film about undead in the deep south following WWI. In a savvy move Coogler was able to secure ownership of the film and concept after 25 years which is not something Hollywood studios typically grant. It is yet another mark of the power player Coogler is becoming. It would appear his gamble is paying off as 'Sinners' is not only something of a surprise hit at the box office but is winning rave reviews from critics as well.In post WWI America twin brothers Smoke and Stack return to their small town Mississippi home in the Jim Crow south following a stint working in Chicago for the mafia. It is implied that perhaps they are fleeing Chicago after they overstayed their welcome. In any case they have returned, and have a grand plan of opening a juke joint. We see them reacquaint themselves with some of the locals who never went anywhere including some spurned love interests. We see a lot of this through the eyes of their younger cousin Sammie, who is the nominal protagonist. Sammie is a local preacher's son, but has a gift for playing the guitar and singing the Delta blues. In a separate scene we see an odd Irish immigrant named Remmick on the run from a handful of Native Americans. When he flees into a house occupied by a Klan couple they rebuff the Natives of course, but little do they know they have literally invited a white devil into their home which goes poorly for them very quickly. Later as the juke joint opens its doors and gets rocking and all seems to be well Remmick shows up with his new acolytes claiming to be travelers just looking for a good evening of song and dance and drink. Put off by the oddity of them and the fact they are white they are turned away, but soon all hell will break loose as their true purpose is revealed, and it will be a challenge for any to survive the night with vampires on the prowl.As I said 'Sinners' is a fan and critical favorite, and i hate to fall on the side of skepticism, but I am not as sold on it as most seem to be. Let me be clear that I am far from a hater, and there are a lot of good things to like about 'Sinners'. The production value and direction of this film is top notch. Clearly not only can Coogler make a very good looking film oozing with that prohibition era deep south feel, but he also has a very confidant and assured hand as a director. There is a tracking shot early on that follows someone across the street, and then a different person back that is really slickly executed. The actors here are also in top form with Michael B. Jordan excelling in the dual role of Smoke and Stack, and what could come across as a cheesy gimmick feels very natural within the context of the film. I think everything outside of the supernatural elements work incredibly well. Now in come the peace and love, singing and dancing vampires. Clearly Coogler, and probably music director Goransson as well, want the music of the movie to be integral to the lore they are weaving. There have always been tales of old bluesmen making deals with the devil for their skills, and while that isn't the case for our young, skilled protagonist the belief is fostered that his skill with music can conjure up musical shaman stretching into the past and into the future in what feels like a harmonious nexus point at this juke joint on this specific night. To what end I am unsure of, but it is certainly at the forefront in the storytelling. It is also his skill that apparently summons the vampires as they claim it was the music that drew them, and they appear as performers themselves before things go bad. Interestingly in the 1930's I am not quite sure how prevalent vampire lore would have been in the rural deep south, but there is one person at the party that has roots in the mystical and has heard tell of these creatures so she can give us the standard info dump on this story's vampire rules such as needing to be invited in, and killing the lead vampire doesn't allow any others to revert to human form. For the most part once the vampire tale kicks in it becomes a standard if well executed tussle between the steadily growing number of vampires and what live humans remain. Afterward the narrative jarringly pivots right back into its prohibition era narrative as Klansman arrive to shut this juke joint down unaware of the events of the previous evening. It is an incredibly odd juxtaposition. Then we are treated to what I would consider a somewhat standard ending where the enemy you think did is not necessarily wiped out which clearly leaves the door open for this world to be explored more. In the end I did enjoy 'Sinners', but I just do not think it is a top 10 movie of the year although do not be shocked if you see this on end of year lists as well as it being a possible awards contender. I thought everything outside of the vampire portions of the movie were handled perfectly, but the supernatural elements could have been honed to a sharper point. In addition the story's attachment to music was presented and clearly important, but never truly explored or interpreted or even put to use to serve the story. As it stand 'Sinners' is a very good movie that falls just a bit short of being excellent."

          "content": "I walked into Sinners expecting a bold, haunting horror story. What I got was a confusing, pretentious mess wrapped in beautiful visuals and a great soundtrack - and that's it.Cinematography - 9/10\nEasily the best part. The film looks incredible. Every frame feels deliberate, the lighting is moody, and the 1930s Mississippi setting is brought to life with eerie beauty. Unfortunately, good visuals can only carry a film so far.Music - 8/10\nLudwig Göransson delivers a powerful score that fuses blues, gospel, and horror atmospheres. The music actually made some scenes feel more meaningful than they were. Without it, this film would've felt even more hollow.Story - 2/10\nThis is where it really falls apart. The plot is overstuffed and underexplained. Vampires, gang wars, religious overtones - it throws in everything, hoping something sticks. Nothing does. The pacing is sluggish, and the tone shifts make it hard to stay invested.Characters - 3/10\nMichael B. Jordan tries, but his dual performance is wasted on underwritten roles. None of the characters feel fleshed out or emotionally grounded. You don't care what happens to anyone, which is a death sentence for any horror film.Horror - 1/10\nBarely there. A few creepy visuals don't make up for the lack of actual fear or tension. The supernatural elements feel random, not scary. There's no build-up, no payoff - just weirdness for the sake of it.Audience reaction - 0/10\nNot exaggerating: half the theater walked out before the interval. People were visibly bored and whispering \"let's just go!\" under their breath. That kind of mass exit during a horror film says everything.Final thoughts:\nSinners is a frustrating experience. It's all style, no soul. Looks great, sounds great, but at its core, it's empty, slow, and overambitious without delivering anything truly memorable. A horror film that forgets to be scary - or engaging."

Those scenes were the best part because it combined different music genres and could win awards. This movie also had important messages about culture assimilation. Unfortunately, the movie definitely has its slow moments where it drags. And speaking of the end, the final vampire fights felt like they were over before they even really started. But I thought the post credit scenes were compelling. So, Sinners a bit of a mixed bag. Definitely watch it for the great music scenes, but be ready for some slower parts and a quick wrap-up to the action."

But the 'horror' twist didn't sit right with me-it broke the grounded feel and the writing suffered a bit because of it. I watched 1 trailer and that's about it. I wanted to be in the dark for a majority of the film and even though I was spoiled, I was still expecting the supernatural theme to be done better. It felt like a Jordan Peele rip off. Not a bad thing, but I thought the writing could've been stronger in the 2nd half. Still, I'd recommend it, though I get why the supernatural shift might not be for everyone."

The music choices gave it a soulful atmosphere, and the wardrobe was genuinely inspired-there were moments that visually captivated me. But all of that was wasted on a script that didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it a horror? A comedy? A parody of itself? The tonal confusion made it hard to invest emotionally, and by the time the supposed climax arrived, I was too checked out to care. It's one of those films that confuses noise and chaos with impact. Honestly, it felt like a missed opportunity from start to finish.People in the theatre were clapping at the end and saying they were genuinely terrified by how scary it was (maybe I was terrified of losing two hours of my life)."

A great cast and the not-so-young anymore Hailee Steinfeld, of \"True Grit\", took me by surprise! And the girl can sing, which you won't see in the movie but on one of the two album releases of 21 songs that are out now streaming on Apple Music or you can hear it on YouTube. A new discovery (thanks to HER) in Miles Caton who learned to play the guitar for this role, Delroy Lindo, and other 'new to me' discoveries who I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Its diverse and interesting inclusiveness says a lot! Michael B. Jordan as twins with each personality in those roles, etched out clearly in their world. Ryan's friend Ludwig Göransson's music touches my heart deeply. Ok Ryan, you can proceed with Black Panther 3 now but I will excitedly await your next surprise! Oh!

Picture racism, cotton picking, smack dab in the middle of the great depression. Not much to look forward to.Suddenly, twin brothers from the area return from Chicago for unclear reasons. They seemed to have learn how to be ruthless there as mentioned by gangsters and Capone. They brandish guns freely and display the air of invincibility of people in power.The story reconnects us with their lives in this town and especially their acquaintances. They dream of owning their own Juke joint so they plan a night of mad revelry to celebrate it with all their friends.The story takes a hard sideways break when strangers approach the party and from there on, all hell breaks loose.I'm still thinking about what the main themes are - sin while you can but you have to pay for it later perhaps. Or live for the day because you never know. Or love your friends deeply because you never know. There certainly is the knife edge them that you can be up high one day, then suddenly you're not.Terrific acting across the board. Very vibrant dance and music scenes mixed in with some blatant racism scenese to push your emotions even more.The cinematography brings you into every scene, whether that be scenes above cotton fields, next to cotton pickers, inside the world of musicians, or sexual ecstacy.Sinners is a wonderful, wild and wicked film. Bloody so beware. My only complaint was that sometimes the 1930s southern accent was hard to understand everything. Sometimes subtitles appeared but I don't know why.I hope you go and experience Sinners. Enjoy."

Ludwig Göransson gave some banging blues throughout the movie, but my favourites are Rocky Road to Dublin and Magic What We Do.I did have a thought that the movie was a tad bit long, even though the runtime was just two hours and fourteen minutes.I felt the epilogue was not needed. In my humble opinion, if the movie had ended when Sammie Moore left the town, I would have been more satisfied with the movie, but that's just me.And in conclusion, I would say.... Hailee Steinfeld looked gorgeous in the Party outfit.Have a good one, y'all."

The twins return home and randomly open a nightclub. For what reason? There is zero buildup, no explanation, and suddenly, on opening night, everything explodes into chaos. It feels like the writers needed a backdrop for destruction, not an actual story. The audience barely gets a moment to understand the club before it's wiped out.The biting scenes are just bizarre. Some characters get bitten and are drenched in blood. Others get bitten the same way and walk off with no visible injury. Where is the consistency? It feels like the blood effects were applied randomly without any thought. This kind of sloppy inconsistency takes away from the horror and makes it impossible to take seriously.There is no real tension, no proper suspense, and no emotional payoff. The film rushes through its horror elements without giving the audience a reason to care. Nothing feels earned.Even with talented actors like Michael B. Jordan and Hailee Steinfeld, the cast is underused. Emotional scenes feel unnatural, the dialogue is weak, and the direction comes off as unsure of itself. It tries to say something meaningful, but the execution falls apart completely.In short, Sinners is a film full of wasted potential. It feels rushed, confusing, and filled with senseless decisions that make you question why it was made in the first place."

Much of the movie was dialogue that introduced you to all the characters and the excitement/ action finally came towards the end when the vampires show up. Would love to really give this movie a great rating but just can't because this movie was overall (dare I say) BORING. The ending was not so good as well and felt anticlimactic. Coogler's best movies (at least for me) are still the Creed franchise because this movie just fell flat for me and was certainly not as good as people are making it out to be."

Overall mediocre movie at best and something that I wouldn't want to watch twice. Honestly I don't understand why it has so high rating.

          "content": "Depending on the viewing mood I was in when watching my first reaction could have been one out of any ten options on the scale. In taking some time to (attempt) to digest it, I believe there are moments that are so spectacular , with even magical like properties that should deliver it huge praise. There are other elements that are just so horribly bad it feels like a razzie. The two related questions I have to ask myself are this: 1. Are the poor elements so bad that it entirely washes away the incredible moments. 2. Am I willing to wash my mind of the bad elements so that I can crown it as a groundbreaking piece of art and cinema? The answer for both to me is No. However I can see how some may arrive at totally different conclusions on this film in terms of ratings. Since I feel my rating could change even by tomorrow I will simply provide what my thoughts are, the good and the bad.First off, this film is daring and kudos to that. In recent times it feels we watch many of the same movies over and over. This film tries to blend a period piece of the Jim Crow South with horror. At first glance it may seem an awkward combination and watching it almost feels like breaking in new shoes because it is so new and different. However, despite this being a movie ultimately about vampires, it oddly provided it a very good lens into the fear African Americans were made to live in during the Jim Crow South. Coogler clearly is wanting to make a social point about the period and although the sharecroppers are hiding from vampires it very much feels they are hiding from their white overlords of the time. The actors do a great job displaying this fear throughout.The second part and probably the part I was most mesmerized by was the use of music. The film has a truly trance like quality to it. With the costumes and cinematography you are fully engaged and brought into the film. Despite how ridiculous some of the scenes are at the end, the entire theatre was still sticking around in a zombie like state watching the end credits scene. I've never before viewed people stuck to their seat for a horror after like this. There's just something to the movie that's different than mostly anything else you've seen and for that reason it can be viewed as somewhat transformational. The high quality of the music and dance just truly can't be emphasized enough.As already somewhat touched on, the costume design, lighting, music, acting, all top notch. Many potential Oscar worthy aspects.Now on the other hand there are some huge question marks and problems. First of all you would have no idea you were even at a horror movie for the first hour and a half. This in itself is not a problem, but other than the camera shots it doesn't do much to establish the characters. Having Michael B. Jordan play both Smoke and Stack as brothers is really confusing at times as their characters really aren't much different either. More background on their time in Chicago could have been added beyond that they were just bad guys with the likes of Capone.When you re watching them try to build the characters it almost feels like you missed a first movie that doesn't exist. It touches on previous relationships in such sparse details that they feel unimportant and yet they are critical. The dialogue is even a bit choppy to the point I'd have wanted to rewind or have subtitles.The transition from what seems like a period piece movie then is incredibly clunky. Just all the sudden this Irish sounding vampire in disguise comes out of nowhere and starts trapping some of the local klan or klan sympathetic members.Ultimately this results in a showdown between the Michael B Jordan characters/brothers and his invitees who were just looking to have a good night of fun, music and dance with white vampires trying to claim their souls. The battles and music make for a hilarious and fun time, but in the back of my head I still was wondering if something as serious as the Jim Crow South should be reduced to white vampires attacking African Americans.Needless to say I was still willing to let it play out and enjoy the film until the ending. I loved what I thought should have been the actual ending with Michael B Jordan absolutely lighting up the Klan Grandmaster. It felt just right that Jordan's character would go out on a high , save Sammie, and be with his love in the afterlife.Then came the after credits... the most unnecessary piece of film I may have ever witnessed... and I've viewed all the Marvel ones... Anyways it shows Sammie in his older years playing a guitar with the somewhat surprising arrival of vampires they hadn't stabbed/ freed that night many years ago. The vampires are led by the one Michael B Jordan character that had become a vampire saying his brother decided to let him live in that state in exchange for not going after Sammie. The fact that the one human twin brother let his then vampire twin brother exist in that form is completely puzzling. If he'd stabbed him and freed his spirit he wouldn't have been able to come after Sammie anyways ? It makes no sense at all when he knew he had to stab his love through the heart with a stake to free her spirit, yet he wouldn't do this for his brother? Sammie then just decides to play all these other vampires a song and says he expected them to return.Then it gets even weirder... both Sammie and the vampire Michael B Jordan oddly agree that it was the best day and night of their lives. As this is was all going on everyone in the theatre is just sort of half standing and half sitting not knowing whether the movie is over or not and clearly wondering what the point of this end credit even is.The length of this end credit and its content just totally confuses the entire meaning of the film. What was so fun about losing his family to vampires? Having the vampires return also didn't exactly show they were liberated from the white landlords (which is perhaps a point trying to be made that today they are still not free) but again, what exactly about this made it the best day of their lives?Overall, as I've said , there were so many enjoyable chaotic moments. Much of it like a Tarentino finale in fact. But did it spoil it by going too far and trying too hard particularly with the end credits? I'm not sure I'll ever be totally decided. You be the judge !"

          "content": "When comparing Sinners to other vampire-themed films, it undoubtedly stands out as one of the best in the genre. It doesn't just rely on the usual vampire tropes, but instead dives deep into meaningful and complex themes such as racism, family relationships, and the human struggle between following the flow of life or giving in to darker paths.One of the strongest aspects of the film is the performance-especially by the twin brothers, who brought emotional depth and realism to their roles. On the darker side, the vampire character was portrayed with compelling intensity, adding a strong antagonist to the narrative.The music also played a major role in the storytelling. It wasn't just background-it was a narrative device in itself. The soundtrack elevated the film's atmosphere and emotional impact, especially since Sami, the protagonist, is a guitarist, and the story often revolves around his music.The true masterpiece moment of the film is Sami's performance at the concert. The scene was brilliantly directed, blending fantasy and reality in a single, continuous camera movement that made it both visually and emotionally powerful.However, the first act of the film felt a bit slow-paced, to the point where I found it slightly boring at the beginning. It took time to build momentum, which might not appeal to all viewers.Overall, Sinners is a film worth watching, especially for those who appreciate deeper narratives in genre films.My rating: 8/10."

Without spoiling I was disappointed it jumped into really just a thriller when trailers would lead you to believe it would be a more balanced horror/thriller. I think a lot more could have been done and build some real suspense and stakes, the opening sure made it feel like there would be.Most of the run time is world building and build up, and it does it well. Feeling more natural and less plot point happen because the story needs it it to progress even if unnatural. I like the genuine inclusion of other cultures elements that felt genuine and all respectful.Some people read into the movie too much and look for things to be defensive about. At times it can feel like there's an alagory that the white man is the devil incarnate. Or that the literal monster thing is the lesser of the evils. Who cares really. It's not obtuse about it or heavy handed and pandering, so it really is up to interpretation.This movie is a good thriller but not as good as the higher rating reviews would lead to you to believe, but it certainly not remotely as bad as the negative reviews would claim it to be.And we can all appreciate seeing the klan getting slaughtered no matter who you are."

I was especially moved by the lead-so much vulnerability and strength wrapped into one.What really stuck with me is how the film explores guilt, shame, and the blurred lines between desire and damnation.

What begins as a moody, unsettling drama quickly reveals itself to be a layered and compelling exploration of guilt, redemption, and the human need for connection. I went in with little expectation and came out impressed, especially by its direction, the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, and the consistently strong performances across the board.First and foremost, the direction in Sinners deserves special praise. The director clearly had a firm grip on tone and atmosphere, creating a world that feels at once grounded in reality and tinged with something more surreal and unsettling. The pacing is deliberate but never dull-it gives each scene the room it needs to breathe, allowing tension and emotion to build naturally. There's a real sense of control here, both visually and narratively. Certain scenes, particularly those in dimly lit interiors or quiet, reflective moments outdoors, are composed with a painterly eye. The use of shadows, close-ups, and silence is often more impactful than any exposition could be.One of the unexpected highlights for me was the music. The songs in Sinners aren't just background-they're part of the storytelling. Whether it's a melancholic folk tune playing over a crucial transition or a more intense track underscoring a climactic scene, the soundtrack is always perfectly in sync with the emotional beats of the film. It adds layers to the mood and gives the audience something deeper to connect with. I found myself replaying a few of the songs afterward-they linger in the mind, much like the film itself.As for the performances, there's really no weak link in the cast. Each actor seems deeply invested in their role, bringing nuance and authenticity even to the most tormented or morally ambiguous characters. The leads, in particular, carry a lot of emotional weight and never once feel performative or exaggerated. Their chemistry is subtle but impactful, especially in scenes of quiet confrontation or introspection. The supporting cast also shines, giving the world of Sinners a lived-in, believable texture.One of the things I appreciated most about the film is that It poses questions rather than offering easy answers, and while that might frustrate some viewers looking for tidy resolutions, I found it refreshing. The narrative leaves enough room for interpretation without ever feeling incomplete. It's a film that respects its audience, trusting us to think and feel alongside the characters.In a landscape flooded with basic thrillers and hollow dramas, Sinners stands out as something thoughtful and artistically ambitious. It's not trying to be flashy or overly dramatic-it just tells a story, quietly and confidently, and invites you into its world. For those willing to take the journey, it's a rewarding experience.If you appreciate strong direction, meaningful music, and actors who genuinely embody their roles, Sinners is absolutely worth your time."

          "content": "Sinners is a gripping and intense film that delves into the murky waters of morality, guilt, and the possibility of redemption. Directed with a sharp eye for tension and emotional depth, the movie presents a raw and unflinching look at the consequences of one's actions and the heavy burden of sin. With strong performances, a haunting atmosphere, and a thought-provoking narrative, Sinners leaves a lasting impression, even if it occasionally stumbles under the weight of its own ambition.A Dark and Compelling Premise\nThe film follows a group of individuals whose lives intertwine through a series of tragic and morally ambiguous events. At its core is a protagonist wrestling with past mistakes, seeking some form of absolution in a world that seems determined to punish them further. The narrative unfolds in a nonlinear fashion, slowly revealing the connections between characters and the sins that bind them. This structure keeps the audience engaged, piecing together the puzzle while questioning the nature of justice and forgiveness.What makes Sinners stand out is its refusal to offer easy answers. The characters are deeply flawed, and their struggles feel authentic. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the ugliness of human nature, yet it also allows moments of vulnerability that suggest the possibility of change. The moral ambiguity is both the movie's greatest strength and its biggest challenge-viewers looking for clear-cut heroes and villains may find themselves frustrated, but those willing to sit with the discomfort will be rewarded with a rich, layered experience.Powerful Performances and Direction\nThe cast delivers stellar performances, with the lead actor embodying the torment of their character with raw intensity. Their portrayal of guilt and desperation is palpable, making the emotional beats land with significant impact. The supporting cast is equally strong, each bringing depth to their roles and ensuring that even minor characters feel fully realized.Visually, Sinners is striking. The cinematography employs a muted color palette, reinforcing the bleak and oppressive tone of the story. Shadows and dim lighting are used effectively to create a sense of unease, while tight framing heightens the feeling of claustrophobia-both physical and psychological. The director's choice to linger on quiet, introspective moments allows the audience to sit with the characters' pain, making their eventual confrontations all the more powerful.Themes of Guilt and the Search for Redemption\nAt its heart, Sinners is a meditation on guilt and whether true redemption is possible. The film asks difficult questions: Can one ever truly atone for their sins? Is forgiveness something that must come from others, or can it only be found within? These themes are universal, making the story resonate on a deeply personal level.However, the movie's pacing can be uneven at times. Some scenes drag on longer than necessary, while others feel rushed, leaving certain character arcs underdeveloped. Additionally, the bleak tone, while effective, may be overwhelming for some viewers, making it a challenging watch rather than an enjoyable one.Final Verdict: A Haunting, Thought-Provoking Experience\nSinners is not a film that offers comfort or easy resolutions. It is a brutal, unrelenting examination of human frailty, forcing the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about morality and consequence. While its heavy themes and deliberate pacing may not appeal to everyone, those who appreciate psychological depth and moral complexity will find much to admire.With its strong performances, atmospheric direction, and compelling narrative, Sinners is a movie that lingers long after the credits roll. It may not provide answers, but it certainly leaves you with questions-about yourself, about justice, and about whether anyone is truly beyond salvation."

From the very first frame, it captures a rare emotional atmosphere-anchored by stunning music, unforgettable songs, and a lead performance that is nothing short of phenomenal.The protagonist delivers a masterclass in acting, embodying his character with such intensity and charm that it's impossible to look away. The soundtrack, meanwhile, is its own character-elevating scenes, carrying emotion, and giving the film a soul.However, there's something-difficult to define-that holds Senners back from being undeniably iconic. Perhaps it's the lack of character depth early on, or the limited practical display of the twins' supposed influence. These missing pieces slightly weaken what could've been a perfect film.Still, I walked away feeling grateful. It's not often we get to experience a film with this much heart, elegance, and cinematic richness. I'd recommend it to anyone-especially for its music, tone, and nostalgic essence. It may not be flawless, but it's a modern classic waiting to be crowned."

It wants to be provocative and layered, but ends up being shallow, tonally confused, and utterly impossible to take seriously.The film attempts to tackle serious themes like sexuality-there's even a bizarre, forced cunnilingus reference that feels more like a desperate shock tactic than meaningful commentary. Add to that an out-of-nowhere dance scene with breakdancers and twerking, and the film completely loses any semblance of atmosphere or narrative consistency. You can't expect an audience to stay emotionally engaged when the movie keeps undercutting itself with ridiculous tonal shifts.It throws in romance scenes that feel so hollow and unnatural, you'd swear they were AI-generated. Nothing about the relationships feels earned or believable. And while the movie clearly wants to \"say something\"-about sin, love, desire, morality-it fails to land any of it with depth or impact. Every statement feels surface-level, performative, and completely detached from real emotion or insight.Visually bland, poorly written, and thematically confused, Blood and Sinners is what happens when style is mistaken for substance, and provocation is used in place of storytelling. My friends and I were bored and laughing for the wrong reasons. Avoid."

As well as the natives hunting said vampires all interwoven with the systemic racism in the 1930's deep south. The characters were all interesting and generally well written, the gore wasn't overdone, and the ending was thematically sensical as you had smoke realize money, power, vampirism etc won't truly set them free and refuse to join his brother in an endless night, while stack gave into the power and forever remained a vampire. The use of music as a motif to connect people across cultures even across planes of existence was interesting and overall the movie ended on a high note."

When the Natives were watching the sun I got excited thinking this was a twist I didn't expect.

It had elements of an inappropriate soundtrack like The Great Gatsby, but a much worse plot and film.

It takes 50 minutes to even get going, and when it does the movie comes across as a poor man's 'From Dusk 'til Dawn' only set in the 30s and without wows, laughs or excitement.Michael B Jordan takes top-billing (twice) as 'crim=twins' Smoke and Stack (get it) and he's decent enough as usual, but the rest of the predominantly black cast is pretty non-descript and throwaway except for rising Brit actor Jack O'Connell, who plays the lead vampire with menace, style and vigour. Shoutout too for a cool cameo from living blues legend Buddy Guy.While the look, feel and cinematography are worthy of mention (and the cool music), it has to be said this over-hyped genre mash-up is slow, messy, contrived, lacking in genuine thrills and way too long - it just keeps meandering along like the script writers kept brainstorming new ideas for director Ryan Cooglar (Black Panther, Creed) to tag onto it! The timewarp segment is a particular low-point. I mean - WHY!?All in all then a total incoherent mess and overall disappointment that's nowhere near the level of cult classics such as 'Blade', 'Near Dark', and the aforementiond 'From Dusk 'til Dawn' that it's clearly trying to rub shoulders with.

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is one of the boldest, strangest, and most unforgettable movies of the year-and I mean that as a compliment. It's part Southern Gothic horror, part supernatural thriller, part musical, and entirely its own thing. It shouldn't work. But somehow, it does.Set in 1930s Mississippi, the film follows twin brothers Smoke and Stack Moore-both played with incredible precision and charisma by Michael B. Jordan-who return to their hometown after a violent past in Chicago. They've got a dream: to open a juke joint that can be a safe, joyful space for Black folks in the heart of the Jim Crow South. But what begins as a story about music and community slowly mutates into something much darker-and much weirder-when they discover that their biggest threat isn't just racism, but literal vampires.Yes, you read that right. Sinners has vampires. Irish ones, no less. And somehow, Coogler uses them not for shock value, but as a metaphor for exploitation-especially the way Black music and culture have been fed on and stolen by white audiences for generations. It's a bold swing, but it lands with eerie clarity.At the center of all this is Sammie, the twins' younger cousin, played beautifully by newcomer Miles Caton. Sammie is deeply religious and blessed (or cursed) with a voice that feels almost divine. His music is haunting-it doesn't just move people, it moves things. Spirits. Shadows. The past. He becomes the emotional heart of the film, a figure caught between his spiritual upbringing and the worldly pull of the juke joint. The supernatural begins circling him almost immediately.Visually, the film is stunning. Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw fills every frame with texture and heat-you can almost feel the sweat on people's skin and the humidity in the air. The use of color is rich and moody, leaning into deep reds, golds, and smoky shadows. Every shot feels intentional, evoking both the beauty and horror of the South at that time.The music, too, is phenomenal. Ludwig Göransson's score blends Delta blues, gospel, and eerie atmospheric tones that stick with you. It doesn't just set the mood-it is the mood. When Sammie sings, it feels like time slows down, and the audience (both in the theater and in the film) holds its breath. It's powerful and a bit unsettling-in the best way.That said, Sinners isn't going to be for everyone. Its genre-hopping can be disorienting, and the pacing is slow at times. Some moments lean heavily into the surreal, and the film isn't interested in giving you clean resolutions. But if you're open to the ride, it's one that sticks with you.What makes Sinners work so well is how personal it feels, even amid its stranger elements. Coogler clearly has something to say-about faith, family, trauma, art, and what it means to reclaim your power. Beneath the vampires and the folklore is a story about survival and identity. About what it means to be haunted by your past-and how to sing your way out of it.In the end, Sinners is a movie about what happens when art meets spirit, when pain becomes power, and when history refuses to stay buried. It's daring, original, sometimes messy-but always alive. It's the kind of film that doesn't just ask to be watched. It demands to be felt."

There were no corners cut in Sinners, just intentional, thoughtful storytelling, emotions, relationships, fear, pain, the desire for more (money, power, freedom), strong symbolism and cinematography to match. It was a homerun.The horror in this movie is, to me, what horror should be; a symbol for something more. Vampires are mere representations of greater evil rather than just being vessels for jump scares in a scary movie. They're the fear of what may lurk in waiting if you let your guard down at the wrong time.Underscoring the cinematography, the fantastic set and costume design, the great acting, the fascinating back stories, the moments of inspired dialogue is music used in a way it's not used enough. It's a device that adds weight to moments that demand to be felt a little bit more than just through visuals and dialogue, it's used to tap into those other parts of the imagination for celebration and horror. I loved what it added to an already great movie.Hats off to Ryan Coogler for daring to go there, even when it's not what's \"hot\" to do in 2025. We don't get enough of these heartfelt films that clearly matter to the folks making them anymore, but this restored my faith in movies like this being able to exist, get made, and be appreciated."

It will certainly be amongst my films of the year. That final scene gives a different perspective on what's gone before, and almost immediately makes you want to watch it again."

I love a good vampire story and film. This had the potential to be a great vampire flick. It missed.This movie had the potential to be a great version of \"Crossroads\". Skipping the devil and selling the souls part this could have been the decision to play forever as a vampire or live out life as a good human and play music until they died.What we got, Two brothers, had a bad upbringing, apparently went to war ( saw none of that) then they went to Chicago, robbed stole and came home with the money. Then we had the mystical story line of the young blues player that transcended time and space with his music and it called to angels and demons alike, apparently that's where the vampires came from.But then they did NOTHING with that except an odd montage mix of old and future music with the blues. That could have been great but the mix didn't work. I looked around the theater and the audience was looking at their spouses and loved ones like \"What is this?\" And then they never came back to it.Then the vampires and the chaos began and as they were sorting it out one of the non vampires was found in a puddle of \"blood\" and they threw his body outside before he turned. But it wasn't blood and we never got an explanation about how he got knocked out.After all the standard vampire battles and the killings and driving them back and the lead vampire was killed, for some reason we had to insert the one man army scene of killing the 20 KKK members that came by the following day. I am all for getting rid of KKK members but it has to match the story, this didn't. Again, a mix of perplexed looks on the audience members faces.The movie ends and we have the young blues player, now an old man, playing in a Chicago night club as the credits roll. That is how it should have ended but I guess someone is looking for a sequel so here come two of the vampires from that fateful night long ago that magically escaped being destroyed.I'm sorry we spent the money to see this in the theater. Should have waited to see it on streaming."

Which just left a bunch of unanswered questions. How did they injure him? Where were his \"followers\"? I mean, he ended up making 50+ in a few hours. Why was he able to be out in the sun?I was really hoping we would see them later in the movie.The music was decent, but the juke joint/blues/rap concert/twerk fest Mashup was..........really.....dumb. Then we find out the being bite by a musical Irish vampire grants you the ability to play flawless Irish folk songs, sing in perfect harmony, all while pulling of Lord of The Dance like gigs. That was just too much.Then during the final fight, the \"followers\" seem to feel his pain only when convenient and be completely unaffected at others. And having a 7-8 survivors fight off 50+ vamps, was ridiculous.The hype machine really did this movie an injustice."

It is good vs evil, it is a black love, black people trying to hold on to our culture. It is impossible to escape racism in this country. 'Chicago is Mississippi with tall buildings'. Other cultures may have the same ability to transcend time with music, but the blues is the basis of all American music. To have this movie come out now when America is trying to erase Black history feels revolutionary. Being true to your gift is everything. American society is the blood sucking vampires."

A lot of times, I couldn't hear what they were saying, and when I could, it didn't make much sense.The story itself was also weak and non-engaging, and the way they edited and put the movie together was messy and sloppy. Nothing really seemed to connect nor made sense.It looked like Coogler was trying to mix movies like \"Inglourious Basterds\" (instead of killing nazis, they were killing KKK) and \"From Dusk till Dawn,\" (yeah, let's change to vampires in the middle of the movie) but it just didn't work at all, it super-misfired on all cylinders.There were also some obvious newbie mistakes. For example, there's a scene with the twins standing next to each other, but one of their shadows was super long and the other was short. It was clear those parts were filmed at different times of the day. The director didn't seem to care about these details.Something else that really bothered me was that even after everyone knew the bad guys were vampires, the vampires kept using the same dumb lines and acting innocent to try and get inside. Even a little kid wouldn't fall for that.Basically, \"Sinners\" felt rushed and not well-made at all. Zero enjoyment out of 2 hours wasted.Makes me believe that many of the high ratings are probably bought and fake."

Let's not allow the Internet to ruin movie theaters.We decided to watch Sinners this week. As with any and all movies that deal with \"race,\" we were told by various friends and family it was either \"amazing...Jesus-like!,\" or, conversely, \"It's a bunch of wokist (fill-in-the-blank).\" Curiously, no one commenting on the movie had actually seen it.I'm politically independent and I don't give a crap about the red or the blue religion and their sheep-like minions. I like good movies.This is a good movie.Does it have flaws? Sure. It's too long. Most movies over 90 minutes are too long, to be fair. This is not an issue unique to this film.It doesn't quite know how to end. I got a little fidgety by the time the second of its three endings rolled around.That's a minor thing as well.Aside from that, this is a movie that maintains your attention for the bulk of the ride. It's got some drama. It's got some humor. Some great music (ironically, the Irish jig performed outside the juke joint is infinitely more rocking than the blues played inside the juke joint; the theater we watched the movie at was nearly full and the entire audience was moving their feet and bobbing their heads to the infectious, traditional Irish groove).I'm tired of super hero movies. I'm tired of sequels. I'm tired of reboots, or remakes, or re-imaginings, or whatever euphemism Hollywood wants to peddle for its general lack of originality. The fact that this movie was none of those things greatly helped my enjoyment of it.There is obviously some sort of political message underneath it all. As with Jordan Peele's US, it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the movie as a piece of entertainment. Unless you're a super uptight right-winger or a giddy liberal arts victim who can't look at anything without seeing 'race and gender,' you should be able to enjoy this movie as much as I did. And if you are obsessed with the political, well, so much the better. The movie will rile you either way.I congratulate the filmmakers. I hope Hollywood takes more chances on movies like this."

Every scene feels deliberate, with haunting cinematography and a restrained yet gripping tone that slowly pulls you deeper into its world. The performances are subtle but emotionally charged, capturing the quiet desperation, guilt, and longing that drive the story forward. While the opening is a bit slow, it's a purposeful choice that lays the foundation for the emotional weight that follows, allowing the narrative to unfold with thoughtfulness and gravity.The audio design is nothing short of phenomenal-every echo, breath, and note is meticulously crafted to heighten immersion and emotion. It's a film that begs to be seen in theaters, where the soundscape can fully envelop you and intensify its most powerful moments. Once the story settles into its rhythm, it delivers raw impact and quiet devastation, building toward a conclusion that resonates long after the credits roll. The after-credits scenes aren't just bonus content-they carry real meaning and add depth to the story's emotional arc. This is a must-see cinematic experience that lingers long after the final frame."

So now she is filled with rage n ready to cross the line and invite them inside however she is fully aware of the consequences (vampires can only enter place when invited inside) oh btw THERE IS AN ARMY OF THEM OUTSIDEToo many to count however what I could count was how many heroes were left inside and there was 6 with 1 extra but when the vampires invade they instantly kill 3 people (i have never seen before) & the same lady who was filled with rage died killing a vamp, that would leave 3 people leftBut by some miracle there is still 5 of them 3 more die then the last 2 are separated by a SEA OF VAMPIRES one facing his twin the other on the run from the main vamp (oh yh his ankle got busted because he ran out of a door on the 2nd/3rd floor the same door they was going to use anyway god knows how they would have gotten down)He is obviously captured by the villain (whose motives are never explained) & just before the antagonist delivers the final blow the other survivor who was trapped fighting his twin vampire just appears behind the villain and kills him and then I kid you not around 30s later the sun comes up to kill the rest of the vampiresWe have no clue how he got past the horde but what we do learn is how he got past his twin vampire, for some reason not explained to us he was able to make a deal with this twin vampire (even though throughout the movie we are shown that the vampires work like they are connected to hive mind what one knows they all know or atleast the main one does) after making this deal, the vampire twin somehow avoids the sunlight and snatches his love interest (who is also a vamp) to then later appear in the post credit scenesLike I said it throws all logic and sense out of the window because the stakes got to high and they didn't know how to come down."

I will of course try my best to review it but i genuinely only have good things to say about it.Firstly, the scoring. I think this has to be the first thing any one talks about when discussing this film. The scoring not only enhance the story or makes the moments more impactful the music is embedded in every thread of the film. It enhances nuance that you wouldn't be able to feel without it. There are so many scenes i could reference this to but i think the most impactful is the scene where sammy is playing and the feeling of past, present, and future music all intertwines to create this moment where you feel the culture deeply in your soul. This was probably one of my favorite scenes in the whole film.Secondly, i mean visually this movie is stunning. To be fair i saw it in 70mm which shows more perspective than the regular showings. Regardless though the colors and composition in which it's filmed adds so much artistry to this movie. I thought there was an interesting aspect of color theory when it came to the stack brothers. Both of them had a love interest and the coinciding love interests had matching colors to the stack brothers. I found it interesting that mary's was muted pink, because like her character in a way she was a muted black person. During this time in history if you had that amount of black blood in your family history you were considered black. She of course would've been able to enjoy the privileges of being white passing in other places but for intents and purposes of this film she was navigating a more prominently black community, which made sense cause during this time she would've been viewed as black.Finally the historical relevance of some of these scenes were so incredibly well done. You don't particularly need to know about it to enjoy the storyline but as someone who is deeply interested in how society functions under specific historical timelines, i thoroughly enjoyed reading about certain parts of this movie.10/10 everyone go see it."

So being that I was tired, I really had to pay attention to what was being said as the Southern accents were a little difficult to follow.So make sure you have a great sound system to hear this with because there are a few extra modern melodies to listen to.Also, the movie does not end when the credits appear. Obviously the young people that left the theatre early are not blues fans and they missed the actual ending. Poor form!I also felt like there were a few inconsistencies. But they are explainable as it is dark fantasy and do not really takeaway from the movie too much.Sinners is a breath of fresh air in a world where new ideas are very few and far between.

Who knows?The script seems to want be a commentary on race relations, almost to the extent that the film is an allegory concerning Black freedom in the face of Jim Crow. But it pulls back from that, and tries to be many things at once (see above).Because the film is so perfect -- beautiful cinematography, art direction, and sound -- you spend a good deal of time admiring the aesthetic perfection of it all. And therein lies the problem. There are no rough edges, as everything is sanded to historical beauty. It's a tension-free and airless affair, a pretty bauble in a vacuum. The result is a film that defies engagement, as though it says \"Admire me, but don't get too close.\"By the time the vampires roll in, you wonder how the film you are watching -- ostensibly about setting up a Black nightclub in KKK land -- can have anything to do wtih vampires. Well, it doesn't; and so the introduction of the vampire element makes the film pivot 90 degrees so that it can . . . Can what? Be that aforementioned allegory? A musical number is dropped in for what reason? It makes no sense.Perhaps that allegory, again, is what the film aims for. \"We are all one\" a character says, meaning Black and whites together. But that character is a liar and he speaks only of togetherness in death, so we know that such togetherness is false. Link this to the KKK man who sells the brothers the club at the film's outset; he says, \"Ain't no KKK around here for years.\" Which is, too, a lie.There are some embarrassing moments, such as the depiction of Asian southerners whose come-and-go Southern drawls are cringeworthy. Or the sexy married woman who courts one of the protagonists, shakin' and shakin' and shakin'. Or the bizarre and literal connection the film makes between blues and contemporary rap. What?You've seen better, trust me. This is nothing more than candy, a lot of sugar but no real substance."

The music and dance scenes are anachronistic to say the least and the whole work borders on racism. The only white people in it are Klan or vampires... seemed very deliberate to me. The use of one actor playing twins seemed pointless and just made some of the scenes feel awkward and contrived. Maybe as a non American I also found the dialect hard to understand.

Ryan Coogler didn't just direct a movie-he conducted a spiritual ritual. Every layer of this story held meaning: ancestral grief, resistance through art, and the aching beauty of choosing hope when the world offers none.The scene that lives in me now is the one with Sammy singing blues across time. As people from every era danced and connected through sound, I felt like I was part of something eternal. Coogler captured what creative people have always done for the oppressed: they help us dream beyond survival. Without artists, this world would be so much harder.And then that scene-that scene-where the Irish vampire and the Black man prayed the same colonized prayer... It broke me. Two men from historically oppressed groups, speaking to the god of their oppressors, both finding uneasy comfort in a faith that once erased their own. That moment was honest. Painful. Necessary.This film isn't just good. It's important. It makes you feel, it makes you think, and above all, it makes you remember. I give it a 10-not just because it was flawless, but because it gave me something I didn't know I was waiting for."

We meet a wealth of interesting characters and at first the danger seems to lurk from Klansman who may be planning to destroy the brothers plans. But boy were we wrong.About half-way into the proceedings, the true evil reveals itself, and the movie switches gears as we are lead into a Louisiana version of From Dusk Till Dawn. What is so clever and original about this version, is that it uses music to show us how it links the past and the future, and how Blues music is so sinful that it attracts evil, or \"the hate\", as it is called here. The main musical number (you won't miss it) is absolutely incredible, as it calls to the spirits and the menace that comes knocking at their door.Michael B. Jordan is great here as he skillfully performs both twins \"Smoke\" and \"Stacks\" and gives them separate personalities. But the stand-out performance for me is Miles Caton who sent chills down my spine with his Blues and his effortless acting. This boy should get an Oscar nomination. Without doubt, Sinners is the type of original movie that I've been waiting for. It subverts your expectations about how music can be woven into a story. You don't need to be a horror fan to enjoy this, because the first half, stands out on its own."

Black/white tensions, scenes of beautiful rolling cotton fields, a beautiful cast. The panning shots, lighting, scenes are beautiful and really deserve an oscar for the filmography and score. Some of the singing and music was just stunning, and built into the story beautifully. The acting is pretty good, and scenes are really painted out well.The negative? The story is pretty rambling and weak amd definitely plays second fiddle to the atmosphere of the film. Also, while talking about the past it is solidly in the modern era in its attitudes toward race relations. It's like a modern leftist view of how the plantation era was, with a wakanda like optimism of black relationships. So it's a (modern) 'black' idealist view, making the characters more like charicatures, and similarly white people are depicted as 'crackers' in the most part, though there is some sympathy for the more musical white characters.So what is this film? An atmosphere piece with great music amd filmography. Did I like it? Yes, it was a beautiful film. And no, it had preconceived ideas of black and white people (nice and fun black people, awful and boring white people). That sheen of discrimination makes it a 'black' film, and through its racially discriminating approach, a little two dimensional. Should you watch it? Sure, it's beautiful and sounds great."

          "content": "Ryan Coogler's Sinners is a genre-bending masterwork-a slow-burning supernatural thriller infused with historical weight, musical soul, and emotional intensity. Set against the racial backdrop of the Jim Crow South, it's both a chilling vampire tale and a profound story of legacy, culture, and resistance.✅ ProsI. Stellar Performances\n1. Michael B. Jordan is outstanding in dual roles as Smoke and Stack Moore. His nuanced portrayal of twin brothers-one hardened and ambitious, the other introspective and wounded-anchors the entire film.2. Miles Caton, a breakout talent, adds soul and vulnerability as Sammie, whose music becomes both a weapon and a salvation.II. Bold Genre Fusion\nThe film defies categorization: part horror, part historical drama, part musical. This genre mash-up works surprisingly well, especially in the hands of a skilled director like Coogler.III. Striking Visuals & Atmosphere\n1. Lush, moody cinematography paints the Mississippi Delta with equal parts beauty and menace. The supernatural elements are visually stunning but never distract from the emotional core.2. Period details-from costuming to set design-are spot-on, immersing viewers in the 1930s Southern Black experience.IV. Social & Historical Substance\nThemes of exploitation, cultural erasure, and systemic racism are not just present-they drive the narrative. The metaphor of vampirism as a representation of white supremacy and cultural theft is powerful and intelligently handled.V. Outstanding Soundtrack\nLudwig Göransson's blues-infused score pulses with heartache, resistance, and rhythm. Music is a character in this film, not just a backdrop.❌ ConsI. Pacing Issues\nThe film takes its time building momentum. Viewers expecting constant action or horror might find the first act slow and heavy on exposition.II. Complex Themes May Overwhelm\nWith so many thematic layers-race, legacy, family, faith, and supernatural folklore-some threads feel underdeveloped or rushed by the third act.III. Horror Fans May Want More Bite\nWhile Sinners contains vampiric horror elements, it's not a traditional horror movie. Fans of straightforward scares may be left wanting.IV. Supporting Characters Underused\nTalented cast members like Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo do strong work but have limited screen time, leaving their characters less developed than they deserve.🎭 Verdict:Sinners is not just a film-it's an experience. Thought-provoking, emotionally resonant, and visually rich, it's a bold and deeply creative entry into the supernatural genre. Though not without flaws, its ambition and execution make it one of the most original films of the year.Final Rating: (9/10)\nA poetic and potent fusion of horror and heritage-Sinners is an unforgettable confession of American sin and Black resilience."

Ryan Coogler delivers not just a story, but a full-bodied experience set in 1930s Mississippi. The supernatural elements are woven seamlessly into a rich historical backdrop, creating a world that feels both eerie and grounded. Michael B. Jordan's dual performance as twin brothers is astonishing-equal parts intimate and unsettling. The film's visuals are breathtaking, often drenched in atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll. The musical score, deeply rooted in blues, isn't just background-it's part of the soul of the film. And while Sinners is filled with symbolism and deeper themes, you don't need to decode everything to appreciate it. You feel it. More than anything, Sinners reminded me what great cinema does: it pulls you in, shakes you up, and leaves you transformed. It's not just a film you watch. It's one you experience."

Blues music is the center piece of the movie and every musical act is perfectly put in place.Sometimes, I'm bothered when horror movies take too much time to present their monster. However, in Sinners, the writing, the backstory and the characters make it so effective. As a matter of fact, I would have take 15 or 20 more minutes to know more about the native tribe. It might be the only question mark that I have after watching it.From Michael B. Jordan to debuting Miles Caton and without forgetting Hailee Steinfeld, every actor play their role wonderfully. Michael B. Jordan plays double duty with twin brothers. If you need different clothing colors at the beginning to know who is who, the differenciation becomes clear throughout the movie. This might be his best performance yet.Sinners is a surprising original movie which is very important for the buisness. Music transcends the whole story and visuals. I think it could be a contender at the Oscars, espicially in the music and script categories. Sinners is an early candidate as best movie of the year."

Jordan-head west to open a nightclub and outrun the street life. Caught in their gravitational pull is Miles Caton, a young man desperate to escape his father's shadow and chart his own path.Orbiting this core trio are supporting heavy hitters. Omar Benson Miller supplies amiable muscle, while Delroy Lindo steals every scene with velvet menace. Together they form a family you can't help rooting for even as you flinch at their choices.Then Remmick walks in.

The sudden swerve from crime caper to gothic nightmare shouldn't work, but director Ryan Coogler lands it with style, flipping the stakes from fast cash to everlasting damnation without missing a beat.In the end, Sinners is a tale of ambition, blood ties, and the cost of transcendence-served neat, no chaser. Come for the gritty hustle; stay for the supernatural bite."

So I m sitting watching the movie and about 1hr of the movie is character development I started skipping it while watching it I was like ok that's enough but if I was at a cinema Jesus. Ohh yea back to the trailer said it was an action horror thriller think they left out the musical part. Weird flash back history about music through the ages to vampires then a final fight with kkk. I was like what the hell did I watch. The end of the movie I was not even thinking about the movie or the story I was thinking what the hell is the director thinking. After watching it I enjoyed it made me think what the hell did I watch but damn if I saw this in a cinema I would be pissed trailer is kinda misleading.... Musical."

I like them all on their own plate. Why on earth did you put them in the same bowl?There's a reason that the world follows themes and patterns. So people like me can't leave the theater wondering what the hell did I just watch? Sometimes breaking the recipe and trying new things makes it taste even better than before. Well, not this time."

To start, the music used throughout movie was terrible. The acting and forced accents was terrible also. The random past and future music come together scene was so random and didn't make sense. I thought the twin was visiting his MOTHER and next thing you know they are sleeping together! The Indians searching for vampire? This movie left no explanation as to why most things happened. Yet they had plenty of time to explain.. because for the 1.2 hours it was building up to juke opening but very uneventful and not much back story. Most of what could be considered good about this movie is the last 30 mins of a 2 hr movie. So much I could type but I won't. I just don't think it's worth the hype."

The obscured action scenes and excessive runtime hold it back from true greatness, but the performances and thematic depth ensure that it leaves a lasting impact. If you're a fan of morally complex dramas with stunning cinematography and powerhouse acting, Sinners is well worth your time. Just be prepared for a few pacing hiccups and the occasional frustration of not being able to fully appreciate the action. A flawed but deeply compelling film that lingers in the mind."

It fails to keep you on the edge of your seat because it never utilizes any suspenseful storytelling and fails to keep you guessing what will happen next.

If this exact film had been made by a lesser-known or indie director, I highly doubt it would be getting this level of attention or acclaim.

I will start off by saying the production quality was great, effects were well done, the score was excellent, the acting for a large majority was great, and it was shot really well. Where it was lacking was actual plot or more so deciding which plot to go with. The movie spends the first hour successfully developing characters and adding depth the story while touching on some very heavy topics. Then, almost immediately makes a left turn into B-horror antics while abandoning the storylines they were building up. I left feeling like the movie wanted to be so much more but just couldn't find the mark so it resorted to a classic survival, human vs. Monster film and hit every trope on its way in."

          "content": "Sinners is a well written, well acted and well directed high concept and technically well made entertainer that successfully manages to fuse several genres of cinema into a slow burn dramatic horror action thriller.Ryan Coogler sets the movie in a black community of the South during the 30s. Paints a background of cotton fields and town with a community based on race and color. Then he adds the color of the movie's characters, their beliefs and complex relationships before injecting it with thrills, chills and a fair dose of vampire blood.What really stands out in the movie is its beautiful cinematography, outstanding performances from the cast and powerful score. The premise of a group of humans in a bar at night vs a coven of Vampires in a bar may sound very \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" but that is where the similarities between the two movies starts and ends. After all this is a movie from the creator of Fruitvale Station, Creed and Black Panther so expect racial commentary, drama, suspense, action before horror.The only reason this is an action horror movie and not a social action drama is because its group of black characters are surrounded by Vampires during the night instead of the Klan. Some horror fans waiting for the Vampire action to start might find the initial half of the movie a bit slow but it is worth the wait. At the same time fans of social dramas should not get repelled by the sight of vampires, after all it is a different version of the same evil in a different suit.Even though I would have loved to see some more action in the movie's climax, it still packed a good enough punch. I loved the introduction of the Choctaw Vampire hunters in the middle of the movie and would have enjoyed the movie even more if they made a return....maybe in a spin off. Also loved how as soon as the dust settles at the end of the night, the sun is greeted with a very different type of action. The icing on the cake is the mid credit scene which beautifully ends the movie.....so don't leave the theater before the real ending. Loved it. 8/10."

He not only wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, but had to pitch it to Proximity Media and Warner Bros. Pictures. Truly daunting, and well done!The beginning first thirty-or-so minutes are excruciatingly slow. I wished a lot more cuts and edits had been made to leave the superfluousness on the editing room floor, which, to me, would have made for a more streamlined and edgier movie experience. Still, once it begins picking up the pace and getting to the meaty parts, it's one film that shouldn't be missed.The music alone is great, with a mix that blends various styles and genres like the blues, gospel, modern, and Irish folk. It's a treat to the ears. It also doesn't overdo it, which some films featuring music tend to do.Beyond just the music, the characters played by Jack O'Connell (Remmick), Wunmi Mosaku (Annie), Li Jun Li (Grace), Delroy Lindo (Slim), and Omar Benson Miller (Cornbread), are all excellent and arguably so, a watch-worthy prequel could be made about each of them! :)Lastly, the themes of community, identity, oppression, trauma, memory and the power of music, hit heavy and land well.8/10."

          "content": "Posts on X echo this sentiment, with some users calling it \"horrible pacing\" and \"BASURA\" (trash), reflecting audience frustration with its lethargic start.In contrast to From Dusk Till Dawn, which balances scares, humor, and action with a lean 108-minute runtime, Sinners feels bloated and pretentious, mistaking slow pacing for depth. While some reviews praise its ambition and performances, others on platforms like Reddit criticize its lack of horror and overreliance on exposition, with one user noting, \"The first hour and 15 minutes is an endless array of exposition... it plays more like a Southern drama\". The film's attempt to weave in themes of racism and cultural appropriation is admirable but heavy-handed, overshadowing the horror elements that should drive the story.Ultimately, Sinners is a missed opportunity. Its talented cast and crew deliver moments of brilliance, but the glacial first hour, lackluster horror, and uneven genre blend make it a chore to sit through. For those expecting a thrilling vampire showdown akin to From Dusk Till Dawn, the film's somber tone and sluggish pacing will likely disappoint. If you must watch, consider fast-forwarding through the first hour to reach the action-but even then, the payoff may not be worth the wait."

          "content": "Sinners DID NOT disappoint the audience in most aspects that were required to make a groundbreaking film. Starting with the concept of a thriller and horror film, the story unfolds quite logically, the 2h running time is sufficient enough to catch up with, and the approach to the film games the eyes of many given the reversed montage from end to start, arousing curiosity in the audience. What Sinners really capitalized on was working with a pretty detailed character matrix within barely 2h of movie time-sufficiently deep information on each character's background is given, not too much or too little, just enough for the audience to catch on to the psychology behind each character. Not necessarily filled with excessive scares or gory scenes, the film still manages to maintain an ominous atmosphere and instills the feeling of being pursued all along. MBJ really shined and was convincing in portraying 2 distinct character lines without the feeling of repetition. All character portrayals suit the different storylines and the varied psychology behind them. They had good music and acting, so even if the audience escapes from following the film closely, they would still appreciate something decent.What's so revolutionary about Sinners is the music. Bringing to modern-day audiences a music that has been centuries-old-the blues unwittingly breathed new life to this horror movie genre by chance. The music became the heart of the movie, with every piece of music being executed without being rigid but extremely truthful and faithful to the original music. When we encounter so-called \"melody\" in the scene, the music not only attracts attention over time or soul but also the audience, a musical experience in a horror movie never experienced before. Taking Imax as the form of the movie also helps partially to support the music reaching super climax and causing goosebumps in the audience. It is possible to describe this as a genre breakthrough, free and spontaneous but promising and attractive.The originality that the sinners bring is linking 2 parallel narratives with only 1 scene, and the side story is being presented in the form of inserted movie scene sound. Not that much is given in the way of praise but Sinners is one of those pioneering films that have managed to recreate this and bringing a sense of authenticity without being over-loaded.Even though it has numerous compliment, Sinners still fails to quite effectively bring the horror story into the movie smoothly. There is still insufficient context and information behind it somewhere, making people seriously curious about what the source of the horror force is in the movie. Though overall the movie does an impeccable job as a horror genre with the two new additions towards the ending that could possibly promise something for the upcoming installments."

And with little effort but serious dedication. Commitment. And talent i can promise you this one reached out and in lengths that are very real. Intentionally or not. I will be watching Sinners with joy and appropriately! Well done.🖤 out of place is a real feeling. Rejection. Unpresentable. Want to be connected. Involved or even loved. Just like this--films show us to. How--being a simple decent human being and doing the right thing might as well be a life sentence if you know what I'm saying. Its so fragile right as men we just want to protect what's ours, just like a mentality of some soldiers. All they want is that special some one to call their own even like when times are dire. No matter how badass they are--there will always be harder-times ahead.\"Critics get somethings right. They how ever missed the point, even a vampire gets tired of humanity too so what was the point of being the bad guy when your own destiny is taken away again. Mary and Stack had-to start anew, forever doomed body and soul this time. Having no choice to finally accept as well a special kernel of Mary's truth about being upfront when the cards are on the table and we cannot read minds-not really alone-Stack had Mary and the memories of being truly free for just a few hours that night.Sammie is the belt that holds everything together. His power of song-believers-are in cultures around the us.Remmick was perfect to put some fear in you as a person of color it never went further than that for me. He was just very creepy with that robin song. Is there an actual religious significance to a robin ?"

Every time he sang, it felt like the film finally had a soul.Michael B. Jordan's performance as the twins was okay-ish-not bad, but didn't exactly blow me away either. The setting was moody, the visuals were strong, and I could tell they wanted to say something deep about guilt, bloodlines, and facing your demons. Whether that message actually came through? Debatable.It kind of reminded me of Get Out-not in terms of quality, but in the way it tried to wrap a social message inside horror. The difference is Get Out delivered that message with precision, while Sinners kind of stumbled trying to get there.Still, points for ambition. But without the soundtrack, I'd honestly rate this a 5/10."

The relationship between the twins, Smoke and Stack (played by Michael B Jordan) is touching, it's amazing how he creates such a different feel for each character.

It's another painful reminder that Hollywood is running out of ideas. And let's be honest we don't care if the humans die, it's not like it's Clooney, Tarantino, Kietel, Lewis, & Cho.

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts\" it's some of Marvel's darkest material to date, dealing with the emotional wreckage of broken individuals grappling with their past choices and finding camaraderie amidst the emptiness of their lives. This may be a team-up movie, but it very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back, while Lewis Pullman delivers a complex performance as a sympathetic character at war with himself. The imperfections somehow all feel fitting for this anti-hero team of misfits. Putting emphasis on the character work and practical action makes this feel like the old Marvel that has us for a decade plus. Wish we'd gotten this sooner.\"Thunderbolts*\" it's a bold dive into trauma, healing, and redemption. Proof that even the so-called defective losers and disposable delinquents can rise above their past and become the heroes no one expected. It's gritty, emotional and unlike anything Marvel has done before - a must-see story that hits where it hurts and heals where it matters.I can tell that the movie is one of Marvel's most enjoyable films in a while. It feels different than most of the studio's projects. Its bold, funny, filled with great action and an unexpected emotional punch. It has the rewatchable factor for sure. Has so much spark, charisma, and tells a genuinely emotional story you connect with.It is truly fantastic, the cast has electric chemistry with each other (Florence Pugh & Lewis Pullman are the standouts) and the action sequences are very strong. But most of all, the movie's story is bold, important & so well-written. Florence Pugh brings the heart, David Harbour is consistently funny, & Lewis Pullman might be the stealth MVP.This is probably one of he most if not the most humane movie filled with allowing their anti hero being flawed, broken and regretful. Sebastian Stan has an absolute scene stealing moment, yet Florence Pugh shows she is the true lead of the new generation and team. She is the star, that shines the brightest. There's a lot to love in this movie honestly.A visually daring, emotionally resonant superhero movie that pushes mental health to the forefront. The MCU future is bright. Definitely stick around after the credits, there are 2 scenes and the last one will make you so hyped!"

          "content": "So this is what maturity looks like in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After years of leaning on forced quips and sitcom-style dialogue, Thunderbolts arrives promising something different. Something deeper. Something grittier. But beneath the darker color grade and the serious expressions, it's still the same Marvel formula. New paint, same blueprint.It's ironic, maybe even overdue, that Marvel finally tried copying DC after more than a decade of DC trying to be Marvel. But instead of carving out a new direction, Thunderbolts plays like a sterilized version of Suicide Squad. The rough edges are gone. What remains is a movie that wants to feel bold but is constrained by its PG-13 rating and its real mission, which is selling action figures to teenagers.The marketing pushes the idea of character development. That's generous. Most of these characters already had entire shows dedicated to their arcs. If they didn't connect with audiences in six to ten hours of streaming content, they're not going to do it in two. What we get instead are a few familiar poses, another sarcastic exchange, and some recycled trauma. It's not development. It's repackaging.The story structure is painfully familiar. A shady government mission. A team of broken toys. A world-ending threat. Cue the third-act group therapy session and a last-minute save. This is Marvel's 36th film, and it plays like it was assembled by an algorithm trained on Marvel's greatest hits. That might not be a cinematic crime, but it's getting harder to care.Sure, there are a few laughs. Some of the lines land. The cast has chemistry. There are brief moments of tension before everything melts into overprocessed CGI. But when you strip away the fan service and the built-in affection for these characters, the skeleton underneath is generic and forgettable. This story could have been outlined on a napkin in fifteen minutes.The film clumsily stitches together characters from earlier titles and calls it synergy. You get three super soldiers, a sidelined Black Widow, and a handful of underdeveloped powers that never quite make visual sense. To raise the stakes, the writers throw in a god-level threat and hope no one asks why. If one Winter Soldier was enough to carry a film, then three of them plus a demigod must be worth your time, right?But the real issue isn't just recycled plots or overused archetypes. Hollywood has always done that. The problem is scale. This movie cost nearly 200 million dollars. That budget could have supported twenty other films with original ideas, new voices, and something real to say. Instead, we get a lifeless monument to franchise maintenance.There was a moment when Marvel seemed to grasp that the audience wanted more. You could see it in Daredevil, in the early promise of Moon Knight, and in the strange ambition of WandaVision. But then came She-Hulk, Thor: Love and Thunder, and a wave of content that treated depth like a liability.Thunderbolts wants to be the pivot point. It wants to announce that Marvel is ready to evolve. But it still follows the same playbook. It markets itself as bold while playing it safe. It pretends to break the mold while filling in the same tired blanks. Maybe that's enough for those happy with recycled thrills and darker lighting. But if you're hoping for something new, all you'll find here is the same old noise in a lower key."

Yelena is chaotic, dry, hilarious, weirdly heartfelt, and painfully relatable. I'd follow her into any fight, even if she's roasting me the whole way.

It has something endearing about it and is fairly memorable, I think.First, I love this whole erratic chemistry, but strong chemistry nonetheless ; and the way they assembled this team of misfits is obviously not without reminding us of these oh so tasty ensemble action movies from the 90s !!...And yeah, we have already witnessed these various characters in different situations (at the exception of a particular one), so we know what they are capable of and how things could eventually go south in and off the field quite likely, but at the same time we also have never seen them put in such a chaotic situation as a newly formed (and seemingly dysfunctional) team...But this movie's biggest strength lies in its emotional core and the way each of the different protagonists face the events that happen on their path...So it truly feels good to experience each of all this -not so- little moments and how the characters distinctively react and grow from there ; it's really nice to see how they all evolve, step by step, whether it is as a team or on their individual journeys... Yes, you feel the growth in strength of the team as a whole, how they understand each other, but moreover they instinctively end up figuring out the part they have to play for the sake of all... And this comes from each of their inner struggles and subsequently from the self discoveries that arise from that ; which is a process that is truly enjoyable to see all along the movie... Especially because Marvel Studios know how to craft these entertaining human interactions, through hilarious banters and zany situations indeed (which of course make the various connections tangible and tasty), but also by progressively carving relatable characters with life trajectories that give them a greater depth once mysteries unveil and stakes progressively rise...To be noted that the political themes (control, manipulation, corruption) as well as the introduction of a particularly iconic new character, both are a slow burn that offer a great richness to the story, once its dynamics take a new turn and the threat that was hanging over it from the shadow becomes concrete ; with some very crisp and effectively impactful scenes and moments (whether it Is through the juicy dialogues or the cool action scenes, which all have a precise purpose as well as a language that viscerally demonstrates the extent of the impact of this series of choices and events)...That was for sure a very enjoyable ride all the way, and what must be emphasized is how the whole movie is filled with a fair amount of deeply humane emotions (the psychology behind each of the characters and how each of them try to carve their way in order to find a bigger purpose in their existence despite the burden of the dark pages of their life)...which gives this film an extra soul that is everything but insignificant and takes its story to a higher level. In the end, the movie offers a pretty organic trajectory to all the main characters ; and it gives a lot of sense and meaning to what we just saw as well as future of these characters and the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward (the two post-credit scenes give you some more of that taste while obviously inviting you to watch the new future stories to come)... Purely delightful and quite satisfying overall ! Definitely."

          "content": "Thunderbolts*, yes - with the '*'. The very same one where people thought it would be rated 'R', but in reality it's a not even PG-13 level, but rather a sloppy mess that is so cartoon like it would've been written by children.With the marvel pictures that Marvel have been spitting out, quality is far from priority. Thunderbolts* is easily the most boring picture I've seen in the theatre, the picture wasn't enough for me to pay attention, my eyes drifting off to whatever was around.I wouldn't expect it to be anything interesting, my expectations was average, after seeing 'Venom: The Last Dance' and 'Kraven the Hunter', there wasn't anything to be surprised.However, the thing was - it's ridiculously boring, whether it was seeing the thing copied and pasted over, something wasn't right.And here are the three problems I noticed:\n1. The ridiculous cartoon like nature, it looks like whatever they did, they tried making it as family friendly as they could for a PG-13 picture, for some strange reason they just have to make Thunderbolts* like a over the top cartoon.2. The pacing, it's all simply wrong, just like 'A Minecraft Movie', it does not feel like a 'movie', instead it looks more like clips stitch together and labeling it as a 'movie' and call it a day. Thunderbolts* had the same major flaw with 'Venom: The Last Dance', it literally felt it was going nowhere, as if they threw away the story structure of a movie.3. The rushed CGi, like any other Marvel picture, it's heavy with CGi, it wasn't terrible like other past Marvel pictures but there were details that didn't looked right, you could tell if they switch an actor with a CGi, or if the actor's body is CGi.Now, the part you're waiting for.The worst offender would be the theme of depression, their attempt was nothing more than utterly worthlessly pathetic and even a little offensive. They put nearly or no effort with adding depression to the story, I highly doubt research was even conducted. A big reason why we watch movies is to heal, Marvel's attempt to have us relate with Thunderbolts* by adding this serious health condition is something very depressing...\nNo one will read this anyway."

Every moment that she's onscreen (and luckily she's onscreen a lot), she shines up the place.And Thunderbolts really does need some sunshine. From the opening Marvel logo it's a dark affair, both in visual style (the ugly saturated look makes its entrance in the MCU) as in subject matter. Don't let the funny oneliners and random banter fool you, there's a lot of pain in this new rag tag team.Thunderbolts does have a lot of fun with its underdog position. It's easy to see that Feige and co hope this team will be a new GOTG phenomenon. Unfortunately the movie feels a bit too tired to be able to do that. Despite all the reviews and ads proclaiming this will be the renaissance of the MCU: It's really just the Marvel PG 13 version of Suicide Squad.The acting is very good, the visual effects look less rushed then they did in the previous films and I really had a good time. But there remained that nagging feeling that I was watching a movie that knew all the right notes but somehow just wasn't able to sing."

I went in expecting a fun Marvel team up but got something even better: a fresh story, fantastic humor, and well-rounded characters that made it stand out in the MCU.The Vault escape sequence was funny and memorable, capturing the chaotic spirit and humorous banter between the team. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine makes a standout villain, she was clever, cunning, and convincingly evil.The character dynamics were great. Yelena Belova anchors the film emotionally, while Bucky Barnes feels more relatable and likeable than ever. Bob was a fun addition, bringing subtle humor and a few standout moments that added to the story's emotional beats and brought a few moments of intensity. The rest of the Thunderbolts comprising of Red Guardian, Ghost and U. S. Agent also shine, creating a team that's messy, fun, and surprisingly easy to root for.Director Jake Schreier manages to strike a perfect balance between emotion, humor, and action, giving the film real heart amid the excitement. Although the ending was a bit unusual, it worked well. You could call the ending and the movie as a whole, bold, creative, and definitely memorable.Overall, Thunderbolts is a highly enjoyable MCU adventure that's a bit different from the norm - in the best possible way.Don't miss the end credit scene which got me pretty hyped about what Marvel has coming next."

Viewers with no knowledge of the characters except what they've already seen in the MCU are in for a few more twists. But the plot, action, explosions, chases, punching, etc, while all well done, are just gravy compared to the resonantly and movingly handled themes.There are stand-out performances from Pugh and Pullman, but it's a strong ensemble performance all round.This is a must-see for MCU fans, and I'd even tentatively recommend it to people who have never seen a Marvel movie before (so long as they have at least an open mind about the concept of \"superhero\")."

Yelena was pretty decent as a protagonist and Bucky was the best character of the team. Sentry was okay. Not much of him was shown, but maybe we'll see more in the future.Now to the issues, the film felt like a colorless remake of the first Avengers film just without that charm and feeling bland, the second hour felt rushed, and the tonal shifts felt pretty jarring at times.I'd give the film a 6.5 or 7 out of 10. A mixed bag. One thing I must say, at least the filmmakers actually somewhat tried to make a good product out of it, and like I said before, it had its good qualities. And at least this is better than that garbage Captain America 4."

It is a thrilling, character-driven masterpiece that injects a refreshing edge into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overflowing with raw emotion, unexpected alliances, and exhilarating action, this film shows that Marvel still has daring new narratives to share-even from its darker corners.Director Jake Schreier masterfully combines gritty realism with breathtaking comic-book spectacle, crafting a grounded and visually stunning film. The ensemble cast-featuring standout performances from Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as the tormented Winter Soldier, and Wyatt Russell as the complex yet compelling U. S. Agent-forms an unexpected team that works in perfect harmony. Their chemistry is electric, filled with tension, humor, and profound emotional depth.One of the film's most significant achievements is its ability to humanize its so-called \"antiheroes.\" Each character grapples with trauma, and the film courageously explores their flaws in an authentic manner. Yet, amidst the shadows, the heart is abundant, leading to pathways of redemption. *Thunderbolts* transforms into not just a narrative about saving the world but a poignant journey of self-discovery and salvation.The action sequences are not only kinetic and meticulously choreographed but also deeply personal. While the stakes may not be world-ending, they resonate with immediate and palpable urgency. The cinematography and score create a moody, immersive atmosphere that elevates the film above conventional Marvel team-up films.*Thunderbolts* defies the mold of a typical superhero movie. It is a gritty, emotionally charged adventure that redefines the possibilities of a team-up film. With powerful performances, a compelling script, and an audacious tone, it stands out as one of the most unforgettable entries in Marvel's Phase 5."

Thunderbolts could be exactly what we need to show that the MCU is on a fantastic path, ultimately leading us to Avengers: Doomsday.Its perfect.

          "content": "Thunderbolts marks Marvel Studios' bold foray into exploring its darker, morally ambiguous characters in a team-up film that stands apart from the glossy optimism of traditional Avengers narratives. Directed by Jake Schreier, the movie brings together a ragtag group of antiheroes and reformed villains.The film's strength lies in its gritty tone and character dynamics. Yelena and Bucky shine as the emotional anchors, both carrying heavy pasts while trying to redefine themselves. Their uneasy camaraderie and banter bring a surprising amount of heart and humor to an otherwise somber premise. The action sequences are well-choreographed, grounded, and visceral-far more grounded than typical Marvel fare, making the stakes feel real.However, Thunderbolts isn't without flaws. The villain lacks the gravitas to be truly memorable, and some team members are underdeveloped, serving more as plot devices than fully fleshed-out characters. The film also struggles slightly with pacing, especially in the second act, which feels uneven and dialogue-heavy.That said, the film succeeds in offering a refreshing take on heroism. These aren't saints saving the world-they're broken people trying to find purpose, often in morally gray ways. It's this rawness that makes Thunderbolts stand out. The cinematography leans into cooler tones and shadowy visuals, fitting the film's conflicted tone, while the score subtly enhances the tension without overpowering it.Overall, Thunderbolts is a welcome shift in Marvel's storytelling approach. It offers a mature, character-driven narrative with enough action and emotion to satisfy both longtime fans and newcomers looking for something different. While not perfect, it lays strong groundwork for future stories in the MCU's evolving Phase 5. A must-watch for those craving complexity over spectacle."

          "content": "'Thunderbolts*' is a great MCU film, probably mostly due to it mostly being a non-Super Hero film, and thus feeling more grounded and (semi) realistic. Even though this film follows 'Captain America: Brave New World', other than a few mentions, it's not a direct sequel - almost-required prior viewing are 'The Falcon & the Winter Soldier' and 'Black Widow'. The heart of the film's plot is following Yelena (Pugh)'s search for meaning and family, and dealing with her past. It doesn't help that she's working as an off-the-books operative for Valentina (Louis-Dreyfus), head of the CIA.It's a good set-up how Yelena, Ava/Ghost (John-Kamen), Antonia/Taskmaster (Kurylenko), Bob (Pullman - looking like his dad), John Walker (Russell - not looking that much like his dad) and Alexi/Red Guardian (Harbour) end up together, and how they overcome their initial instincts to fight each other. Bucky/Winter Soldier (Stan) has a significant role, as does Val's offsider Mel (Viswanathan) - as they all find something they've been missing when they all come together, no matter how begrudgingly. Without any spoilers, the set-up of \"The Sentry\" and then the unveiling of his powers is handled well, with a bit of an 'Inception' vibe.It's quite quick - under 2 hours (before the credits), with both mid- and post-credits scenes worth staying for, and the black and white newspaper titles are great. The story of the \"Thunderbolts\" name is good and builds naturally - and I won't delve into the \"*\" here, other than to say it's obvious in hindsight. While it has some dark moments - deals with depression quite well - there's still plenty of jokes and fun moments. Very strong performances elevate this film, Pugh and Pullman in particular, with neither playing a stereotypical part. Bring on Phase 6!"

If you are looking for cool action, sure you have some of that, but in that regard this is almost tame for a superhero movie, but there is enough. The best part about the relatively tameness of the action is that the movie doesn't feel like the action sequences were designed first and the story around those (as they have done in the past). I do kind of wish they had been more brutal as this is essentially a movie about villains, but they had to go the PG-13 route.In general, I'm kind of fond of characters who have to learn to leave their dark side behind to become better people, so even the premise was a draw for me.I haven't seen any of the Disney+ series or many of the movies from the past couple of years, but at no point did I feel I was lost. I didn't know that some of the characters had been introduced into the MCU, but it didn't really matter. I would much rather see this is as it's own thing than part of some big continuation."

          "content": "This one has probably been my favourite since the end of Marvel's phase three.It is an enjoyable movie with a good character roster and a solid plot. Action scenes have improved since previous projects (especially compared to the series), and effects are quite decent.However, the movie has some flaws that were hard to ignore for me, like, for example, I failed to get the main tone of the movie. At times it feels like some Suicide Squad kinda team, and at other times it is like the Guardians of the Galaxy, and then they are all serious like the Justice League. I think it is due to the overcomedic scenes in which the essence of the time gets diluted.That might be a very personal take, but one that I find more objective is the overexposition of the character's core and emotions through dialogue, instead of letting their actions do the work, like it was already being done pretty well.Now, I take my hat off to the main cast (except for Mel and Valentina). Their portrait of these characters and their chemistry on screen made me instantly empathise with them.I also value the respect with which they treated the struggles with mental health of The Sentry. From the moment it was announced he would be the main antagonist, I was wondering how they would stop him, and it was managed with class and category, giving us some of the most heartfelt moments in Marvel's cinematic history.Finally, it was a very bold move to promote the movie with a name that was changed later on in the movie, and including Task Master as one of the core members of the team in some of the promotional material and merchandising, taking into consideration that it barely appeared on screen for less than five minutes."

You want tragedy - watch The Penguin and thank me later!After a wave of mediocre Marvel productions, they finally produced something what is a little bit above the average. What a relief! I enjoyed the movie, I didn't had to facepalm or die of cringe. If you love Marvel you will definitely enjoy it. Humor is subjective, I didn't laugh but AGAIN, it cuts in between serious lines which makes the sad parts, less sad.The worst thing is underdeveloped 4 characters - Bucky, Walker, Guardian and Ghost. Bucky is just there doing his armed and dangerous stuff. Walker is mean for no reason - he is probably divorced and that's it - you don't know why he is mean to people, he failed as Cap in a D+ show but it's not the point because it's addressed that he wouldn't fit in anyway because he is rude. Red Guardian is just a drunk uncle. Ghost is just a woman from Ant-Man 2 with cool power. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, YOU HAD 2 HOURS AND YOU FORGOT TO MAKE SOMETHING INTERESTING WITH 4 CHARACTERS OUT OF 6? Yes, Yelena and The Sentry are fine, the most interesting parts of the story. Val De Fontaine is just a boss, just a generic character :(There is no journey - everybody has a problem (trauma), besides Bucky and Ghost. Good job Marvel, again (sarcasm) and nobody solves it. Yelena and her father say we aren't alone and The Sentry finally starts to understand it and you can figure it out what's next. Power of friendship is the key but it doesn't work as I'd like to. It was ended so quickly. It wasn't a fuel to push the story. I love how Iron Man 3 uses it as fuel to push the story - it makes Iron Man build more stuff and make other decisions.The fights were okay, CGI was okay, humor was okay, story was okay. Okaybolts*"

          "content": "Thunderbolts* delivers a gritty, action-heavy experience that stands out in the post-Endgame MCU era. The film wastes no time plunging into high-octane sequences, choreographed with flair and intensity. If you're in it for the action, you won't be disappointed.One of the film's standout elements is Lewis Pullman, who brings unexpected depth and charisma to his role. His screen presence anchors the emotional beats of the movie, and he often outshines the rest of the cast. Pullman's performance feels like the film's best-kept secret - a grounded, compelling addition to a universe often dominated by over-the-top personalities.However, the film stumbles in its character balance. While Florence Pugh's Yelena receives a substantial spotlight, it feels like the rest of the ensemble are left in the shadows. This is especially frustrating given the early and frankly underwhelming exit of a certain character, a move that feels like a missed opportunity to develop a complex and capable character further. Or maybe Marvel's trying to fix their mistake by killing them because the gender-swapped of that character didn't sit well with the fans?As the story moves forward, that uneven focus keeps tugging at the edges. The Thunderbolts are meant to be a team, but it often feels more like a solo showcase with a rotating support cast. You can't help but imagine how much more impact the film could've had if it let its full roster breathe.Anyway, I love this film. No unnecessary political drama like in Captain America: Brave New World, and it's the second-best MCU film since Shang-Chi."

David Harbour and Lewis Pullman also receive accolades for their performances, contributing to the film's emotional resonance.Director Jake Schreier's vision brings a distinctive aesthetic to Thunderbolts, with cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo and a score by Son Lux enhancing the film's moody tone. The use of practical effects and real-world locations, such as a stunt filmed on Malaysia's Merdeka 118 building, adds authenticity to the action sequences.The film delves into themes of guilt, depression, and self-worth, offering a more emotionally grounded narrative than recent MCU entries.

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is unlike anything we've seen before in a superhero blockbuster. Its bold focus on mental health is the beating heart of the film, shaping the story in a way that's refreshingly original. We've had plenty of superhero (and anti-hero) movies, but none have tackled mental health as deeply or as honestly as this. This is as fresh as it gets, and the film hits its message squarely on the mark. Could that message have been louder or more powerful? Absolutely. But is it enough for audiences to understand, feel, and reflect on? Without a doubt. It's a gem that invites viewers to empathize, to look inward, and to recognize the struggles of those around them. In many ways, Thunderbolts feels like a superhero in its own right, delivering a powerful PSA that's woven seamlessly into the narrative rather than feeling tacked on.We're in love with the concept here; an anti-hero film built around mental health. It makes the story and the character arcs far deeper and more meaningful than they'd be if these were just your typical caped crusaders. Thunderbolts* is the MCU's rawest exploration of mental health to date. We've heard the words \"trauma\" and \"healing\" tossed around in superhero flicks before like WandaVision, but this is different. This film doesn't just mention the weight of mental health, it lives in it. Yelena's story, in particular, has been carefully nurtured since Phase 4, and the decision to continue her journey down this road is nothing short of brilliant. Yelena, like Black Widow before her, isn't a superhero with powers. She's human. She's flawed, resilient, and painfully relatable and that makes her journey hit even harder.We actually like the character dynamics between the anti-heroes. We like that every of their personality shines. Their dynamics push the film's mental health themes even further. These might have been the underdogs of previous movies, characters we barely remembered but here, they get their moment. And wow, do they deliver. Each one gets time to prove they're so much more than sidekicks or forgotten faces and by the end, you can't help but root for them.What's especially moving is how much these characters matter both to themselves and to each other. They've all been torn down, denigrated, beaten back, and made to feel like the world is against them. They're loners by nature, forced into the uncomfortable space of working as a team for the first time. Watching them navigate that, to lean on each other when things fall apart, is both heartwarming and powerful. It's a clear reminder of the importance of friendship, of admitting when you need help, and of realizing that none of us can do it all alone.The action sequences in this are great. It's a blast watching everyone throw down and show off their skills. But here's the thing, while the action is awesome, it's not what makes this film great. This movie proves that a superhero film doesn't need to lean on endless explosions to leave an impact. The story itself is raw, human, and beautifully told and that is more than enough. That's why Thunderbolts* stands tall in the post-Endgame era. The action is tight, but the storytelling is what really puts it over the top.And guess what? They didn't rely on cameos. We could safely say that Deadpool vs Wolverine, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Thunderbolts* are the top 3 films after Avengers Endgame but what Thunderbolts* sets apart from the other two is it's the only one that doesn't rely on cameos. It doesn't need nostalgic bait, it doesn't need 'help' from anyone, it's just them trying to save the day and trying to figure out how to solve the problems they are in. And we love them for it.Florence Pugh, as always, is a knockout. She's never missed a beat, and once again, she's phenomenal here. Her accent might not be perfect, but who cares? She's a powerhouse, carrying the weight of a character struggling with identity and searching for meaning. She's the voice of so many who feel lost or stuck, and Pugh brings that to life with so much heart. She's a beacon of hope, a reminder that even when it feels impossible, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The rest of the cast? Stellar too. Lewis Pullman deserves a special shoutout. He proves here that he's a force to be reckoned with. Forget the early skepticism about his casting. He owns it completely, and Hollywood seriously needs to give this guy more credit.And yes, Malaysia plays a huge role in this film and the Menara Merdeka 118 shot is breathtaking. Instead of the usual sunny, warm tones we often see, the film opts for a moodier palette blue, dark, and cloudy which beautifully matches the film's somber, reflective theme. It just fits.The third act really dives deep into the mental health themes, in a way that feels raw and personal. The true villain here isn't a monster or alien, it's the demons we all battle inside. It emphasizes this theme in a way that feels plausible, personable and relatable. A villain that lives within all of us. A villain that everyone of us has battled against in some way and some parts in our lives. How much you connect with the film might depend on how you view your life and how much experience you've dealt with but one thing's for sure, it'll leave you thinking long after the credits roll.Was anything wasted in this film? There is one. One character didn't get nearly the spotlight they deserved. Everyone else got their moment to shine except for one and that felt like a missed opportunity.As for the comedy, it's hit and miss. Some of it lands really well. The belly-laugh kind of good while other moments fall flat or feel a bit forced. Some jokes could've used a little more setup, and a few felt repetitive, but overall, there's enough good humor sprinkled in.We did feel like the third act could have fleshed out more. It could have used more breathing room. It moves fast, too fast at times and some moments feel rushed or a bit disjointed. If they'd let things simmer just a bit longer, it could have been even more impactful.And yes, Thunderbolts* has 2 credits scene. The first one is simply light and funny which is bearable enough but the second one will hype everyone up for what's to come. Not that it's important to reveal it at the end credits but with audience losing hope for the future of MCU, this will get everyone back on their feet, cheering and hoping that Phase 6 will be the same with what Phase 3 had to offer...or at least almost.Verdict: Thunderbolts* is the anti-hero film we didn't know we needed. It delivers a story rooted in something we all face: mental health. This is raw. It's personal. And it feels relatable and real. It explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the power of asking for help, making it one of the MCU's most personal stories yet. It ditches the nostalgia bait and focuses on characters wrestling with their own demons, making their journeys relatable and impactful. The action is tight, but it's the emotional weight that truly lands (Yes, we did cry a bit). Florence Pugh leads with power and vulnerability, backed by a stellar cast and the famous Malaysia's Menara Merdeka 118 isn't just cinematic, it symbolizes the towering weight these characters carry. Thank you, Marvel."

Neither Darkness nor Valentina Fontaine are able to evoke at least some emotions, both images look empty and uninteresting. The storyline is extremely weak, and the battle scenes leave much to be desired - they are quite monotonous and do not capture the viewer. Humor also failed: most of the jokes seem forced and not funny, with the exception of the character Bucky, a veteran of the MCU, who appears in Bob head - he became the only source of smiles.The Sentry character turned out to be insufficiently revealed and rather weak. Robert often behaves illogically and stupidly, which is explained by his memory loss, but instead of arousing sympathy or interest, it is more annoying."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is the hit movie that the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) needs right now. Many people have commented that recent MCU movies are missing the mark, but no one can deny that this new film is a hit. It brings together classic Marvel antiheroes to build one of the most awesome, if unlikely, teams in Marvel history.Thunderbolts* brings us back into the life of Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) who is reeling after the recent death of her sister, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson). When we last saw her in the show Hawkeye, she was working for Valentina Alegra De Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a malicious and conniving politician whose only goal is to rise to power. After the betrayal of Valentina, Yelena must join forces with a team of misfits to take her down.Thunderbolts* is the perfect start to summer. The story shows us the evils that can come from one person having too much power. Valentina's electrifying quote, \"Righteousness without power is just an opinion,\" shocked me to my core. It gives an excellent view into her ruthless, single-minded focus on amassing power. With an ensemble cast like this has, it seemed impossible for Marvel to go wrong. John Walker (Wyatt Russel) battles with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) to be the brooding dark teammate, but clearly, Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) takes that title. When we last saw Ghost in Ant-Man and The Wasp she was struggling with her constant phasing through walls. However, at the end of that film, she and Bill Foster narrowly escaped the police. Bringing her back in Thunderbolts* is a fantastic way to continue her saga for the next generation of the MCU. Another great character, and a source of constant comic relief, is Red Guardian (David Harbour). His lifelong desire to live the super-hero life, and his work as everything from a mercenary to a second-rate limo driver, are a source of tons of humor and great one-liners. And seeing Red Guardian working with this awesome group really works with the movies tag line, \"Everyone Deserves A Second Shot.\"The film's message is that everyone, no matter how many bad decisions they've made in the past, deserves a chance at redemption and everyone needs people who care about them in their corner. Thunderbolts* includes themes of camaraderie, the power of being different, and the damaging effects of loneliness. Parents should note that this film includes many scary moments, including when characters are forced to relive traumatic moments from their lives.Thunderbolts* gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. It premieres in theaters on May 2, 2025. By Jackson N., KIDS FIRST!"

The character of Sentry was good he had two sides to him which was really cool but some plot holes how they made him and how he came to be but the movie was very funny U. S agents actor felt a little flat on the acting but it was okay needed a bit of work was also a bit disappointing they through away the taskmaster character since he's powerful in the comics which sucked but still enjoyed it."

Except for the last 10 minutes of the movie, but there's nothing impressive there either.Well, this new supervillain, who is first turned off with a button on the remote, and then they just say be good and he becomes good.Are fans really so used to eating outright slop that it can receive so many enthusiastic ratings and approval?Of the advantages, I would still like to highlight the cast. Although they hadn't become friends yet, they generated a lot of funny situations along the way. Maybe in the future they will shoot something better with them than this passing film product*It's not the worst movie, and if you're not a fan of that kind of thing, then you can definitely skip it."

          "content": "Thunderbolts is a good and enjoyable movie. And this is coming from someone who was not looking forward to it and had no interest because of the recent decline in the quality of Marvel films.While not the best Marvel movie, but certainly one of the better entries in what feels like forever. It is probably the best film since, well, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.While watching it, I knew this would be a hit with audiences.The Thunderbolt team's dynamics were effective, accompanied by numerous humorous moments. Thankfully, two unexpectedly emotional scenes during the film's climax were not ruined by an unfunny joke that is typical of Marvel humor. I'm pleased that they allowed the serious scenes by serious.During the film, there were a couple of moments involving action set pieces, shots, and character moments that had me saying to myself, \"Oh wow, that's a cool shot,\" or \"That's a cool action set piece.\" It feels like old Marvel again.I liked how the film handled the theme of mental health, especially depression. Both Yelena and Bob share the same struggle with their mental health and have a mutual bond. However, Bob has a dark and sinister alter ego, known as the Void, who becomes the main antagonist. Bob mentions that he sometimes has good days but also has bad days. Whenever the Void has control, Bob has no memory of what happened. But when he returns to himself, he has the energy that everything is fine. The Void's appearance, personality, and powers are an obvious metaphor for depression. The overall message of the film is that you are not alone.Although, and this isn't a spoiler since it's all over the marketing, as New York City is engulfed in supernatural darkness by the villain, I was wondering where Mayor Fisk and Daredevil are during all of this or if those characters will ever bring it up, since the TV show Daredevil is now canon in this universe. It makes you wonder. I would hate to be an ordinary citizen living in this world because one day, you're just going about your day, and then, out of nowhere and without any context, some world-ending threat happens that will affect you for life.Anywhere...This was good. It was entertaining and full of heart. The entire cast performed well, but Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman were the MVPs of the movie."

          "content": "Is this a great movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Yes! Marvel has been doing very poorly lately with one mistake after the other and one bad project after the other. Here they actually hit the mark. This is a very solid mid- to top tier Marvel movie.The bad: there are a few wonky CGi moments which bothers me enormously because we all know Marvel can do so much better, it is like they do not care about quality anymore. I also feel that the movie is too short. We should have got 10 min longer with more development of characters, the team and events unfolding. If so we could have got a better feel. As is the movie is not consistent and uncertain what it really wants to be. The resolution feels a bit simple, a bit short, and fairly predictable. There are also several happenings I am hesitant about and I think they could have been written or directed better.With that said this is still a fun entertaining ride. The Thunderbolts team works a lot better than I thought. The imperfections, which I mentioned above, and the imperfections of the team and imperfect characters somehow work really well within the confines of this movie. Each one in the team (and of course Bob) all have issues, to put it mildly. All the psychological problems and all the emotional wreckage work really well and are told in an excellent manner which strangely almost makes the bad CGi and the less good scenes work. The acting is great, the sound design great, and the action range from passable to great. And, drumroll, there are no politics! The credit scenes are amazing, and worth sticking around for.A huge step forward for Marvel.I give this movie a strong 7/10. There are a few things that bothers me too much to give this a higher score, but if one can overlook some of those issues then this is an entertaining movie with a good message. I was entertained and felt happy about seeing a superhero movie again, I can barely remember the last time that happened.I recommend, just don't have too high expectations. My expectations were very low, which probably elevated my experience."

The plot does kinda centre around Florence Pugh's character and the relationship with her father, the Red Guardian but thankfully it doesn't dwell on it.I felt this movie is better than what I expected, but considering I expected another Marvel trash heap it isn't exactly a raving review.The movie tries to carry the 5 main antiheroes as the New Avengers, tho whether this is tongue in cheek or not I'm still not quite sure. Speaking of the characters, I felt they did a fairly good job, despite their weak entries in previous Marvel shows.Wyatt Russell and David Harbour in particular seem to lap up the screen with charisma and charm, although Sebastian Stan moped his way through the entire film as if he was embarrassed to be there or something. Ghost seemed to be a bit of a pointless character and thankfully the horrible Taskmaster was dispatched early on. Lewis Pullman's Bob/Sentry was the surprise hit for me.. he basically carried the film. He was great and I'll love to see more of him.Elaine seems like she's also loving the opportunity to be the villain but her talents are somewhat wasted here..Overall there are some positive signs that Marvel is getting back on track, putting such abominations as the Marvels, She-Hulk and the Eternals behind us. I just wish they'd tone down the goofy humour a bit and the girl boss schtick has been overplayed by now."

S. Agent, master of weaponry Weapon Master, intangible Ghost n red risky Red Guardian.United they re only hope to stop a hero that let fear get best of him call Void.First this is follow up of Black Widow movie focusing on Yelena play Florence Pogh struggling her past, finding comfort with her father Alexai play David Habour which was the enjoyable of the team , always cheering the team, Sebastian Shaw was the team leader which kind fun looking members to stop Valeria scheme which her acting Dreyful reminds me dancing style from Seinfeld.Wyatt Russell was kind the douch of the team, had some great lines but needed more personality, Weapon Master gets killed off since they meat, Lewis Bullman as the Sentry was awesome as antagonist the Void cause it was great on the metal heath of he's character.So conclude Marvel is giving all for fans go back enjoy there's next phase, with threes month for the Fantastic Four, Thunderbolt is just middle, be fair really not interest for another film of this team unless they make em better in story wise."

Well, definitely debatable but I don't think it is, although it will be enjoyable for the new fans to say the least. Red Guardian steals the show though, he doesn't really have enough screentime but he was hilarious and great comic relief against the other characters serious motives.Yelena, Bucky, Ghost, Walker and Bob were all great in their own rights too, I think they do hold up well and make a great team for the future, it was pretty cool seeing these rouge characters go all out, like I said, new generation of fans will most certainly enjoy this band of misfits.Of course, it is flawed, but not in ways that put me off. Obviously they could've done a bit more expansion here and there, it also felt WAY too long, they could've easily cut 15 mins to get the point across, although that's kinda typical from a Marvel film recently, your not expecting some Shakespeare stuff.Overall expect cameos and a great time, it's an improvement over Brave New World, worth watching for fun but I wouldn't take it too seriously, definitely stick for the end credits, worth it trust me.Grade: C+"

The character development around themes like depression, rejection, and suffering-real struggles many face today-is portrayed in a powerful, respectful way. I'm genuinely impressed. Add to that the stunning cinematography, costumes, visuals, music, sound, and overall production-sublime.From the very first minute, the direction screams quality, and the third act?

At one point, the movie goes on a surreal drama path and takes a deep path towards the inner calculations of our characters, showing us the way to taste the psychology of guilt and innocence. Yelena Belova character is one of the interesting and beautiful characters and we see her complex story in the movie and we encounter the anti-hero team exactly. The action scenes of the movie were enjoyable and sweet but at one point it became a path that went into darkness. The complex humor with the action scene based on friendship shows itself. You look like a complex labyrinth in the complex humor. There is a conversation in the movie with Russian accents and we see this intensely in most scenes. Bucky Barnes makes an entrance with a cool action scene and welcomes us in the movie and I felt the 90s atmosphere that caught my attention while watching the movie. We will see and taste new movies with the Thunderbolts team, there is magnificence in it. A story will emerge from here. I hope Marvel sends off the team it made a good start with with beautiful scenarios. More heroic action scenes and duel scenes I say let them travel to this atmosphere. Of course, they will be the voice of the pushed and oppressed here and they will be able to take the story in another direction. They need to find the action motto and It embarks on this journey with new characters and should continue on its various systematic paths in this way. Thunderbolts' effects were actually good in the movie and it tried to show us this with stop motion and I think it should continue with its dark atmosphere.Watch Thunderbolts."

But as an overall superhero film, I don't think it's worth the theater experience.I can also see why some consider this to feel \"uneven\", with it being so Yelena-centric and the rest of the characters not being as developed (or even affecting the great Bucky). Some might not expect the more emotional-direction and for it to offer so little action. It certainly isn't as memorable as the MCU's best.The worldbuilding (the consequences of the film, the weird Falcon mention and the post-credit scene) continues to feel underdeveloped moving forward."

Still, it's better than most Marvel movies released in 2024.What really stood out was the cast-especially Florence Pugh as Yelena. Her performance carried the film and added depth to many scenes.

It's not bad, but definitely not as exciting as classic Marvel action. It focuses heavily on themes like depression, loneliness, and overcoming the past-just like the trailer hinted. If you're expecting a non-stop action-packed experience like the old Marvel days, you might be a little disappointed here. I'd rate the first half 6/10.Now the second half? It picks up for sure. As the story builds toward the end, things get better and better. There's a tiny bit of dullness here and there, but nothing major. The ending, though-absolute blast. Classic Marvel vibes, emotions, and hype all come together perfectly.And don't leave early-there are two post-credit scenes!The final post-credit scene is super important and has that old-school Marvel magic.

          "content": "Marvel's main producer has finally allowed creative people do its own thing.The problem with modem MCU was an excessively use of CGI to do set and every action scene that made it seem weightless, and an excessive use of comedy that undercuts every moment that is supposed to carry emotional weight.In the past, every time the humor used to come was a way to tell the audience \"hey don't take anything that is happening seriously\"...This basically destroyed all sense of stakes because well \"it made it seem like anything happening there was not a big deal, and we shouldn't get invested in it\".Thankfully, this movie handles humor differently, every time there is a deep conversation or emotional moment it is allowed to breathe, without any cheap joke.This makes it easier for us to relate to the characters and care about what happens to them. This was specially important for secondary characters like this.The CGI had also been a problem in past entries, where nothing felt tangible or real, everything felt like a videogame cut scene, and set pieces seemed super fake and empty due to all the green screens.However, in this movie uses practical effects and it shows. Everything feels real, the city feels real, the action feels real, and CGI is used sporadically only for things that cannot be done with practical effects like the VOID and other sentry powers.The most important lesson from this movie is to focus on making character driven stories instead of plot driven stories. I don't care about \"the world or universe ending\" if i don't care about the characters living in that world.People like characters they can relate to in a personal level. People with flaws, people with universal human struggles.This movie does that well.Everyone can relate to the feeling of wandering around earth without a sense of purpose at some point in their lives, everyone can feel loneliness in a world that is all about individuality, everyone can relate to longing for recognition, everyone can relate to feeling like they are not good enough and everyone can relate to the feeling of a mismatch between what their perfect life looks like to others and the secret silent sadder reality they live inside.This is a movie that is relatable and that's why it has such a high audience score and why it will have strong legs on the box office.You might just want to see guys punching each other and being heroic, people want to feel invested in the characters not just saving the world or the universe or whatever, people want to relate and care about the characters more than simply watching action scenes...After watching this movie, i geneuinely care and want to see them all again, which is a welcome surprise considering I wasn't enthusiastic at all about a thunderbolts movie."

It effortlessly weaves together laugh-out-loud humor, genuine heart, and surprisingly profound themes and emotions, creating a truly immersive watch. The acting across the board is phenomenal, but Florence Pugh's portrayal of Yelena and Lewis Pullman's portrayal of Bob are especially extraordinary, delivering top-notch character development with powerful emotional beats. What impressed me most is how the film tackles important topics like mental health, loneliness, and trauma with such sensitivity and depth. For anyone feeling burnt out by a lot of the straight up slop the MCU has been offering since Endgame, Thunderbolts is a breath of fresh air that actually made me feel something real. This is definitely tied with Guardians Vol 3 for best MCU movie since Endgame. Go see this in theatres! Stay in your seat for the very end credit scene, you won't regret it!"

I mean that Thunderbolts dives into profound themes of the human condition and offers spiritual reflections we have not had the chance to see in the MCU so far. So this is something new for all those who have complained about the supposed \"superficiality\" of these films. With the introduction of a new superhero, The Sentry, the film dares to go beyond standard action and steps into spaces of loneliness, isolation, childhood trauma, the search for meaning, existential fear, the pursuit of light in darkness, and the tendency to escape into destructive patterns. Very layered.When I say \"old Marvel\" I am thinking of that recognizable blend of action, serious stakes, and well-crafted humor, the kind we saw all the way up to Endgame. In Thunderbolts, that formula works again at the familiar level. It will be interesting to see how the MCU handles The Sentry, potentially its most powerful superhero yet. It is still too early to say whether this film marks a full return to the old glory, but one thing is certain, this is a serious project and a well-paved path toward something big. A fantastic film."

          "content": "I didn't expect Marvel to go down a path of mental health with Thunderbolts*, especially when we were so near to Avengers: Doomsday. But this movie works, as it doesn't focus on laying the foundation for the Multiverse or the upcoming Avengers movies. Instead, it tries really hard to be its own thing, which is commendable. How Schreier and his team tackled the issue of mental health is good. They really did a good job. Shoutout to Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman for literally holding the movie together. Pugh was a scene stealer. She gave her all. The way she brought out Yelena's vulnerabilities and imperfections was just flawless. Whereas Pullman does one hell of a job as a Sentry and the other guy (if you know what I mean). If handled correctly, Sentry could have a really interesting, exciting and complex character arc in the entire MCU. But if you guys are expecting anything Avengers-level in terms of storyline and action, then this movie is not for you guys. I'm glad that they relied more on practical sets, action and stunts. But they should have done more. This movie has some really good dark moments too. Son Lux's score is really impressive and experimental. Thank God, this movie's score is not too much orchestral. But they should have done much more, as we are approaching Avengers: Doomsday, and the stakes have to be higher than before. However, I am utterly disappointed with how they treated Taskmaster. She deserved so much better. How can you ruin such an amazing character in two movies?"

The film has the amazing Florence Pugh at its helm and she does an incredible job with her character, if she doesn't get nominated for any award I'll riot. She managed to portray what grief, depression and anger can look like even long after the passing of someone close to you. The ensemble of cast members around her were also nothing short of amazing. Marvel managed to tell a story, portray what most people experience in their life but do it through the eyes of 'heroes' and did not miss a single beat. I cannot wait for the sequel!!!"

Though she's great, the title Thunderbolts suggests an ensemble - and some of the other characters, like Bucky, feel sidelined. He has a few good moments, but doesn't seem to be driving the plot.Despite its flaws, the movie has heart, some well-timed humour, and enough setup to keep fans curious.

After the disaster that was the last Captain America movie with Anthony Mackie, I genuinely thought Marvel had lost its touch. That film, in my opinion, was one of the worst in the entire MCU, and it completely damaged the legacy of Captain America. Watching Sam Wilson try to fill those shoes felt forced and disappointing-he's just not the right person to carry that title. He's slowly destroying what Captain America stood for, and it's painful to watch.But Thunderbolts was a shocker-in a good way.This movie finally brought back some of that darker, emotional energy we've been missing in recent Marvel films. The bond between the Thunderbolts team members felt real and powerful. Their connection, the inner conflicts, and the emotional weight of their missions reminded me of what made early MCU movies so special. It had the grit, the struggle, and the human moments that hit hard.It wasn't a perfect film, but it was definitely a step in the right direction. It felt like Marvel was finally listening to its audience again. And that post-credits scene? Hilarious and surprisingly meaningful-it gave a clear sign that something big is coming.Final thoughts: Despite the pain of seeing Sam Wilson ruin Captain America's legacy, Thunderbolts gave me a bit of hope for Marvel's future. If they keep this up-and keep Sam out of the spotlight-we might just see the MCU return to greatness."

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts*\" is the 36th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jake Schreier (\"Robot & Frank\", \"Paper Towns\") and starring Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, David Harbour, Olga Kurylenko, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Lewis Pullman, it is a slow-burningly effective addition to the long-running superhero franchise that works mainly due to its emotional depth.Sometime after the events of \"Captain America: Brave New World\", Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) is feeling burned out from her work as a Black Widow assassin, battling numerous mental health issues as well as other personal problems. In the meantime, CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is facing impeachment from her position as a result of her previous illegal undertakings. As a method of destroying all incriminating evidence, Valentina assembles a team of her agents, which include Yelena, John Walker / U. S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), Ava Starr / Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), and Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), to storm her secret compound to not only wipe out all of the illegal documents but also themselves in the process. After quickly realising they have walked into a trap, the team manage to escape, rescuing a mysterious man named Bob (Lewis Pullman) along the way. With help from Yelena's estranged father figure Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian (David Harbour) and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), this new team of antiheroes work together to figure out what Valentina's ultimate plan is for each of them.At this point in time, I feel like a broken record when I once again have to state that the MCU has certainly seen better days. Though there have been glimmers of brilliance every now and then, the damage has been done to the reputation of what was once an untouchable juggernaut of pop culture, with the recent diminishing box office returns and low fan enthusiasm causing its gradual decent into irrelevance. In spite of these misfortunes, the MCU as we know it won't be completely disappearing any time soon, as there are plenty of other projects in store for us that have the potential to slowly but surely rebuild the foundations of what made the franchise a hit with audiences in the first place. Concluding Phase Five of the MCU, \"Thunderbolts*\" contains just enough action, drama, and emotional weight to raise the eyebrows of even the most disillusioned of superhero fans, hopefully proving that there is still some life left in this 17-year-old cinematic universe.Disregarding the common plot structure we're so familiar with, the film adopts a slower, more down-to-earth approach to its character motivations and the situations they land themselves in. As the film opens, we watch Yelena Belova carry out a routine assassin's mission, fighting her way through numerous adversaries to accomplish her customary goal at the end. While doing so, Yelena narrates that she has become so fatigued with doing the same basic job over and over that she is considering an early retirement, exacerbated by her crippling depression distracting her from the matter at hand. Sometime later, Yelena is tasked by her superior Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in infiltrating the latter's hidden compound, something that Yelena quickly learns is not going to be the usual type of work she is trained to do.Upon entering the compound, Yelena realises that she is not alone in this assignment, encountering a small handful of other agents in similar personal positions to her. From this point forward, we watch as Yelena interacts with her fellow \"heroes\" to discover that they are all intended to die on this mission together as expendable soldiers for their corrupt boss Valentina. This prompts Yelena to take the lead in this group seeking answers as to why it is so significant for them to be wiped out so arbitrarily, especially considering each of their respective accomplishments. Along the way, Yelena finds common ground with her teammates, bonding with each one over the mutual emotional ruts they are currently caught in. In choosing to focus primarily around Yelena and her insecurities, the film immediately provides us with an effective lead protagonist whose relatable self-doubt is something that virtually anyone can identify with. Because of that, it actually feels like we are watching a regular person trying to find purpose in her life rather than some perfect hero with no flaws holding her back.In addition to the appropriately simplified emotion on display, the film's pacing and action is also handled in a similarly stripped back fashion. For instance, instead of a huge onslaught of CGI monsters and weaponry destroying buildings, the film is abundant in scenes of hand-to-hand combat between two or more people. Since most of the main characters lack any conventional superpowers, whenever they are seen fighting off enemy forces, they are often doing so using their own intellect and quick thinking along with either their fists or an ordinary hand gun. As a result, I found that this movie to have more in common with the likes of \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" than any of the recent CG-heavy offerings in the MCU. This is definitely a welcome change of pace for the current state of this cinematic universe, which could allow for the franchise to gradually regain some footing in reality as opposed to becoming lost in a sea of overindulgent visual effects.Although billed as having an ensemble cast, it is quite obvious that Yelena is intended to be the film's primary focus and Florence Pugh handles herself very well in this role. As mentioned earlier, we see many of Yelena's emotional vulnerabilities and insecurities holding her back, most of which come from an understandable place when taking into account what her character has experienced in the past. Unlike many failed attempts at tenderness within modern MCU projects, Yelena's characteristic flaws are taken very seriously here, never once becoming a cheap set-up or punchline for a lame joke. For example, in one scene where Yelena argues with her father figure Alexei, you can definitely feel the pain she must have gone through not knowing whether or not the man she prominently looks up to has been alive this whole time, lending itself to one of the film's most touching moments. It is here that not only Florence Pugh shines but also David Harbour stands out too, who has his own setbacks he needs to overcome. These parts are essential to remind the audience that one of the reasons the MCU retained its popularity for so long is because of the familial connections flowing through all of the characters, and it is comforting to see some of that return here after so long.I was also pleased at how the film addressed some of the other characters' issues as well, with John Walker's previous fall from grace being a good excuse to showcase his possible redemption arc. Wyatt Russell plays up John's residual arrogance and occasional impulsiveness, but proves he is capable of showing his more sensitive side thanks to how his mistakes have shaped him into a much wiser person than before. Anyone who watched \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\" will remember how controversial John's actions were during a particular episode, and this film shows that he is still haunted by the consequences he faced afterwards. Though he can be considered an anti-hero at the end of the day, John clearly wants to atone for his shortcomings and this film gives him a good opportunity to try to do something along those lines.As for the rest of the cast, I wish there was a bit more focus placed on both Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr (Ghost) and Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov (Taskmaster), whose prominence in the film seemed rather diminished when compared to everyone else. Though their significance to the plot was important enough, neither of these characters contribute anything particularly memorable to the overall story, which is a shame because the two of them were the least developed in their original films (\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" and \"Black Widow\", respectively). However, I did enjoy the handling of Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, and Lewis Pullman as Bob since they are responsible for setting the entire story in motion. Unfortunately, I cannot speak at length about either of them due to spoilers so all I will say is that I am curious to see what happens to each character in the future.Though the MCU at present still has a lengthy road to recovery, \"Thunderbolts*\" nonetheless shows us that there is definitely some emotional content worth salvaging out of this long-running cinematic universe. Its biggest strength is obviously that it favours more back-to-basic methods of entertaining its audience, which is something the series desperately needs after so many years of the same bloated action scenes and liberal use of CGI. With that in mind, if you're a hardcore MCU fan still holding out hope for things to improve, then this film might just convince you that things appear to be heading in the right direction. Considering most of what the MCU has offered us recently, it seems that blind optimism is the only thing we have left.I rate it 7/10."

The acting was great, the movie had some funny moments, some serious moments, and it was very action packed. The first half of the movie feels a little bit different from the second half of the movie, but that's also my opinion. (I really wonder what the asterisk is for 🤔) All in all, a really, really, REALLY great movie and it's definitely worth a watch. If you're planning on watching it, try going for 4DX. It's so fun!"

It is worth your money and time and watch. Oh and the villian is amazing, the entire team is amzing. Go watch it....the practical effects were seen here and were juat like in a Nolan movie (maybe not). The emotinal depth in it is outstanding and marvel has done this movie right and is getting closer and closer to being back (for me it is), and it unites the mcu back together.... amazing 9.5/10*"

          "content": "After the Marvel logo appears (returning to comic-book panels instead of just footage from past movies/shows), which then gets zapped of all colour/replaced with darkness (which becomes relevant later on), Yelena Belova does an impressive jump off a building and is a ruthless bada$$ when she needs to be, but also just wants someone to listen to how lost she is. This is in between blowing up a building and saving a guinea pig, as she's begrudgingly working for Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), but seems unfulfilled. Someone else whose heart doesn't really seem in it is Bucky as 'Congressman Barnes', who appeals to the better nature of Valentina's right-hand woman, Mel (Geraldine Viswanathan), before kinda disappearing for a while but then makes a grand re-entrance during an action scene mid-movie.When Yelena's sent on a mission, she encounters Discount Captain America/John Walker, Ghost and Taskmaster (seriously, who'd Olga Kurylenko pi$$ off to get stuck with such a thankless role? Clearly the filmmakers knew EVERYONE figured out she'd be the one main casualty, thus she's unceremoniously offed in no-time like a joke, but at least Yelena shows her some respect. Kurylenko deserved better). Naturally, these 'antisocial defectives' are antagonistic towards one another until they work out they've been set-up by Valentina to kill each other. Then there's the character of Bob, an unknown entity (Lewis Pullman, who has a tricky character to navigate, as he seems like one 'type' to start with...but then becomes something very different later).Also unknown to me was Walker and that's probably why I didn't think much of him as a character here. He's referred to by Ghost as 'dime store Captain America', but I think even that's being too generous. 'A$$hole', as someone calls him, seems more accurate as his default setting seems to be 'angry' all the time. I'm not sure how he even got the gig as Cap in the first place. We're given a snippet of his 'sob-story' (too busy checking comments on his phone regarding him being the new Cap to watch his daughter properly) and learn that he apparently executed someone publicly? Once again, THANKS A BUNCH Disney+ for ensuring that I have NO context regarding several characters featured in your movies due to you not releasing any of your shows on DVD/Blu-ray here. Really makes for a fun time only learning characters' backstories via exposition/a few throw-away lines.If there's one 'good' thing about Walker's character, it's that he does come in useful at times. And that's the main point of this group...that they'd all be screwed without each other. Ghost, who I didn't think much of in Ant-Man's second film (and does nothing here to change my mind), is the only one with powers other than super-strength. She and Yelena seem to get on best (when they're not fighting/insulting each other) and are a good foil for Walker. However, it's Bob who Yelena forms an attachment to/bond with which proves crucial during the film's climax. Speaking of, the film takes its sweet time 'getting going', and even once it *does*, the climax doesn't feel all that 'climactic'.As far as the characters go, Walker tied with Valentina as my least favourite (never been a fan of JLD, and her attempts at being 'funny' here rarely work). I was much more interested in Mel (the actress makes the most of her screentime) and the hint of a potential relationship between her and Bucky...who just seems gruff most of the movie (and quit putting your arm in the dishwasher, Bucky! It's unhygienic!). Still, that's mildly better than David Harbour having apparently been instructed to YELL most of his lines which wears thin pretty quickly. The only truly 'good' moment with him, I felt, was his serious talk with Yelena towards the end when she made it clear she *needed* him following the loss of her sister, as both actors brought the necessary emotional weight.Whether this film 'works' for people or not will likely depend on how they find all the character interactions/dynamics. I personally think they could've done with a bit more one-on-one interaction between various combos of characters (like Yelena & Ghost, or Yelena & Walker). The casting of Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, hands down, continues to be the BEST thing to have come out of the MCU's 'Phase 4'. She's what got me through this movie, as her character is the 'heart' of the film. Without her, I think I would've been pretty bored. What I think a lot of people won't be expecting from this film is it tackling such a heavy subject as depression, so it must be commended for that. And while it's easy to dismiss various stunts/explosions in this movie as CGI/VFX, you might be surprised to find that they're actually done for *real* (just take a look at some of the behind-the-scenes featurettes for the movie on YouTube).The film's main 'adversary' has an interesting array of powers (one might even say they're 'overpowered'...but I guess in certain instances people deem that 'okay'?). I've seen comments saying this film was a 'return to form' for the MCU, but I personally thought it was about on par with CA:BNW (maybe slightly better in some respects). While the mid-credits scene is completely disposable (take a bathroom break and you'll miss nothing of importance), the post-credits scene (which has got to be one of the longest, surely) makes up for it, as I thought it included the best/most 'natural' interaction between this new 'team'...whose name is up for debate, thus explaining that pesky asterisk in the film's title. The end credits (which are more interesting visually than ones we've had for a while) will probably predict audience's reaction to the film's ending/the team's new title (also...getting into legal dispute over copyright of team names? Really, Sam? Hardly befitting the new NEW Captain America). After two so-so films, I think it's a safe bet the MCU's Fantastic Four will be their best film of 2025."

It was great, yes, but I'm still an Avengers: Infinity War girlie, followed closely by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.So what exactly made Thunderbolts great? For me, it's the tight storytelling. Nothing felt unnecessary. Not once did I feel bored or zoned out. I even had to pee in the middle of the movie but literally ran back to my seat just so I wouldn't miss a single moment.The action scenes were solid, the emotional beats landed well, and the best part? You don't need to know the characters going in. It stands on its own. Even if you're unfamiliar with who they are, you'll find yourself caring about them as the story goes on.There's also this moment halfway through where you're left wondering, \"How are they even supposed to beat that?\" And while the direction it takes is something you might start to guess, the execution is what makes it special. The teamwork feels real. Their struggle is believable, and by the end, you're genuinely rooting for them.So yeah. If you've been seeing people say it's good? Believe them. Because it is."

When credits rolled both me and my wife was wait what, was that 2 hours already?Unexpectedly funny, unexpectedly dark!Superserum meets bipolar disorder! Brilliant!!!Red Guardian kills it. Both writers and delivery by the actor. Surprising laughters in dark moments!Actually this is what I have been critiquing for long now. Stop spreading your storylines all over the place, way wider than necessary and start pulling the threads together towards the climax and although this is only a small portion of the multiverse saga and a smaller pulling of threads together it was really great!This movie focused on what they should, the characters and their relationships. Their humanity and small heroism against literally a Herculean task and seemingly impossible odds!They took characters everyone hasn't cared about and made us care about them. Brilliant again!It's really a psychological movie wrapped up in some action and both aspects were done perfectly!Tell your friends about it marvel is back!I actually give it an 8.5 overall but seeing as there are Disney Marvel haters out there that only hate for hates sake and can't even realize when they've won and helped getting marvel back on track I'll give it a 10 for now to help the score and will later turn it down to 9 as I can't actually vote 8.5!

          "content": "This might be a bit long, so bear with me.There's no denying that Marvel has lost its way after Endgame. Since that movie, I've only watched Far From Home, No Way Home, Shang-Chi, MOM, Thor 4, and GOTG3 in cinemas. Out of those, I hated MOM and Thor 4. At this point, all the shows and movies started looking the same, leading to nowhere or taking way too much time to establish anything.Marvel had started churning out movies and shows like rabbits making babies. There was just so much to watch and keep up with-it's crazy. If at least, they were entertaining, I wouldn't have been so disappointed, but majority of the shows and movies were just so mediocre. Even Deadpool and Wolverine bored me to death when I watched it on Disney+.When Thunderbolts* trailer released, I started to feel intrigued again. More trailers kept coming and I started to love the dark tone of it. I finally thought, Marvel is trying to fix its problems with this movie. Although it doesn't make up of the past few years, it has at least started to steer MCU in a good direction.The movie was just as I expected-dark tone with the usual out-of-place Marvel humor. The movie portrays depression, which I think that they did a fair job, not great, but fair, which they rushed in the end. I wish they had added more runtime to double down on the emotions. Nonetheless, it works to some extent. What truly worked for me were the characters. Each of these characters had their own way of dealing with problems and grief.It kind of pisses me off that they took this long to actually do something with this tone. They had a great opportunity with Thor 4, where they could've actually made it dark and shown how Thor was coping with the loss of everyone he had loved after Endgame. It would've made so much impact, especially when he was going against someone as strong as the Butcher and Jane being at the end of her life. Instead, they threw the entire 20-movie character arc and made him a joker.Coming back to Thunderbolts*, one thing all of us can agree is that Marvel does a great job casting for every character, and this movie solidifies that fact. Everyone was good, but for me, Florence Pough is the standout. She's just so good in whatever she does and is stunning with that short hair!The story is nothing extraordinary, it serves it purpose of bringing a few anti-heroes together, introduce a new character, and set up a new team for the future. What holds the movie together is the ground-level action, bold emotions, and superb acting. There wasn't a moment when I thought \"I wish they bring back the Multiverse storyline\". Instead, it kept me hooked with every pivotal event, which kept the movie going, and it went fast.It was also nice to see how Bucky was trying to lead the group away from their emotional trenches because he has been through it all, and the fact that they all accepted it was really heartwarming. From a situation where they had to work with each other for survival to actually wanting to working together is something that happens seamlessly.For the first time in years, I was finally satisfied with a Marvel movie. This is, in no way, an indication that everything is fine with MCU, they still have a long way to go. I just wish that they maintain and improve on this. There are so many incredible stories to tell, and it would be a waste if they just did some dumb stuff.The end credit scene also has raised some level of excitement about the future movies, which this one ties in with the Fantastic Four. But for some reason, I have very less interest to see the FF movie, so not sure what I truly feel. I may watch it, not sure."

          "content": "Marvel's been limping lately, but Thunderbolts proves there's still life in the old formula-and, thankfully, someone (Kevin Feige perhaps?) remembered where they left the blueprint. This is Marvel going back to basics: character-first storytelling, humor that actually lands, and action that serves the narrative instead of trying to out-CGI itself.Florence Pugh once again shows she's one of the the best thing to come out Post-Endgame. As Yelena, she's the emotional and comedic anchor, and the glue that holds this misfit crew together. Lewis Pullman as Bob is the breakout surprise-awkward, vulnerable, and completely endearing. The whole cast pulls their weight, though one character (you'll know who) is \"wasted\", which is a rare misfire in a film that otherwise handles its ensemble well.Where Thunderbolts really shines is in its love for underdogs. These aren't polished superheroes-they're broken, messy, and all the more compelling for it. The film leans into their flaws, using them to tell a story that's surprisingly heartfelt. If you've got a soft spot for losers clawing their way to redemption (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad, anyone?), this one's for you.The plot is pretty straightforward, but what sets it apart is its handling of mental health and depression-topics rarely explored this openly in superhero fare. What starts as a run of the mill MCU adventure gradually veers into darker territory, and the shift works. It gives the film surprising emotional heft without losing its edge.Pacing-wise, it's solid. The action is satisfying, even if it doesn't hit the heights of Marvel's best set pieces. But here, the action serves the story-not the other way around-and that's a win in my book.Worried you'll be lost if you haven't binged the latest Marvel shows or movies? Don't sweat it. Thunderbolts gives just enough backstory to keep you in the loop without making you feel like you missed a whole semester of MCU school. It rewards longtime fans but doesn't punish casual viewers.After the letdown that was Captain America: Brave New World, this feels like Marvel finally found its footing again. It's not just a good film-it's a course correction. And with Fantastic Four up next, Thunderbolts might be the spark the MCU needed.9 out of 10."

Genuinely enjoyable, fantastic acting, great cgi but above all wonderful story telling. Strangely enough I think we need to reflect and thank James Gunn a bit here as it has vibes of guardians in terms of relationships and bonding and this also might be the pathway they are walking as Gunn moves to DC and uses his magic with superman. Audiences want more from our superheroes - we want it to feel involved and real and Thunderbolts does a great job at this."

Thunderbolts* is INDEED the BEST MOVIE since Avengers: Endgame and the best movie of the MCU's Phase 5. Everything the critics have said about this movie in the last week or two is entirely true. This movie is what every other Phase 4 and 5 Marvel movie needed. This IS THE TIME for EVERYONE TO WITNESS the first step and the beginning of the full restoration of Marvel's former glory. Which is why I don't think people should misjudge this movie like they did with most of the rest of Movies from Phases 4 and 5 because THE CAST TOTALLY NAILED IT with this movie. Florence Pugh's performance is absolutely phenomenal, from jumping off the second tallest building in the world to rectifying her mistakes from the past and become a hero... WOW. As a Marvel fan I dare say this: This is what cinema truly is right there.And also Sentry's suit is completely Marvel-accurate.In my opinion, I think for future movies Marvel should follow this movie's steps to keep their glory alive instead of letting it fall down once again. Congratulations to Marvel Studios and for the entire cast and crew, who worked so hard to make this film happen. I can't wait to see what's next for the future of Marvel with the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars movies. I hope they don't let us down with these two movies and Fantastic Four: First Steps. Keep up the good work, Marvel!"

          "content": "Let's be honest - Marvel hasn't spoiled us with good productions lately, especially after the very average Captain America: Brave New Order. That's why I wasn't positive about their latest Thunderbolts movie. But I went. And do I regret it? Did Marvel fail again? Or maybe he showed that he can still make good movies? You will find the answer in this review.Thunderbolts is the latest MCU film directed by Jake Schreier, written by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo. The film presents a team of anti-heroes - and it is not about dark characters like Punisher or Daredevil. This is a PG-13 production, so it is more in the tone of Avengers or Spider-Man.The main character is Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), performing missions for Valentina Allegry de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). During one of them, he accidentally encounters John Walker (Wyatt Russell), a new version of Captain America, who appeared in Falcon and The Winter Soldier. Along the way, we also meet Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) and Robert Reynolds aka Bob (Lewis Pullman). It turns out that everyone has something in common with Valentina, and a certain event forces them to join forces. The Red Guardian (David Harbour) and Bucky, the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) also appear along the way.I won't reveal what exactly connected them because it would be a spoiler. But I can say that the plot surprised me more than I expected. Therefore, it is worth avoiding accurate descriptions before the screening and it is better to be surprised.I must honestly admit that the film surprised me very positively. I had a really good time, not only thanks to the solid implementation (in which practical effects dominate instead of CGI), but also thanks to the right humor. The jokes come out naturally and are not forced, and the greatest applause goes to David Harbour, who once again plays Alexai great. His charisma and comic scenes made the whole room (including me) have smiles on their faces almost every time.But Thunderbolts are not only action and laughter. The film also deals with a serious topic - depression. It is surprising how boldly the characters' struggle with this difficult mental state is shown. At times, the film becomes really emotional and deep - it shows that the greatest enemy can sometimes be ourselves.Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it the best Marvel movie? Neither. But against the background of recent productions - it is really surprisingly good. It's a movie worth watching, whether you're an MCU fan or just looking for decent, emotional entertainment.To sum up: Thunderbolts is a movie full of emotions, humor and action. Despite minor stumbles, Marvel has proven that it can still deliver something of value. I liked it - and I think it's worth going to the cinema and experiencing this screening on your own skin."

          "content": "Closing phase 5 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, Thunderbolts comes as an unexpected breath of fresh air in a period marked by narrative stumbles, drops in quality and a progressive alienation of the public. Since its announcement, the project has caused suspicion: comparisons with Guardians of the Galaxy, a cast of supporting characters and a production full of mishaps - including recasts, rewrites and Hollywood strikes - seemed to point to yet another forgettable chapter in the studio's recent trajectory. But, surprisingly, the film finds strength precisely where Marvel seemed to have lost its way: in its intimate approach, in its emotional construction and in rescuing an identity more focused on telling good stories, even without grandiose visual spectacles.The key to this turnaround is behind the scenes. Marvel brought together a creative team that had already shone in A24 projects - with a director, screenwriter, director of photography and production designer from that label - and transplanted part of that sensibility to the superhero universe. The result is a movie that, while retaining the traits of the MCU, breathes with its own personality. The decision to bring in the Sentry and the Void as catalysts for the characters' traumas is not only bold, but also profoundly effective. Here, Bob is not just a threat, but a dark reflection of what lurks behind the emotional scenes of the protagonists, acting as a mirror of their wounds, fears and unresolved memories.The script, aware that the audience is already familiar with these characters - such as Yelena, the Red Guardian, the American Agent and the Phantom - doesn't waste time with reintroductions. Instead, it dives straight into the human frailties that these figures carry, sometimes suffocated under the façade of strength. By placing their internal dilemmas at the center of the narrative, Thunderbolts does the unthinkable: it makes heroes who were once ignored relevant. This theme of the heroes' internal conflicts was hardly present in the MCU - we had Tony Stark with anxiety attacks and a depressed Thor in Ultimatum - but now, Thunderbolts goes further by exploring the issue of mental health with more maturity and sensitivity. The characters, despite being superhuman, suffer from genuine anguish.This emotional weight is supported by a cast that has grown in both prestige and performance. Florence Pugh, now one of the most respected actresses of the new generation, delivers one of the most solid performances in the MCU - carrying the film with a powerful magnetism and honest vulnerability. Sebastian Stan, David Harbour and the addition of Lewis Pullman contribute to a cohesive ensemble, where the dramatic delivery is consistent and convincing. The cast is undoubtedly one of the film's greatest assets, and makes it possible to empathize with them in a way that makes the dramatic proposal work.Even so, Thunderbolts is not without its flaws. The biggest is the absence of an antagonist with any real impact. The Void, even with conceptual potential, lacks urgency and menace. The film chooses to do away with the traditional explosive climax, a hallmark of Marvel, in order to invest in more contained resolutions, which can generate a feeling of anti-climax in part of the audience. The proposal, although coherent within the logic of the film, leaves something to be desired in terms of narrative tension. It lacked that unforgettable moment, that dramatic explosion that closes the arc with force.However, we must recognize what Thunderbolts represents. More than a dignified closure to a troubled phase, it symbolizes Marvel's reunion with what really matters: good stories told well. By putting the development of the characters ahead of the construction of a larger universe, the movie gets it right. It not only paves the way for the next Avengers, but reminds the studio - and the audience - that you don't have to desperately chase connections to move the MCU forward. It's enough to deliver a story that makes us care.In the end, Thunderbolts is a movie that surprises with its courage to be less noisy and more human. For its willingness to treat its characters with depth and their pain with respect. And if there's still room to grow, it's undeniable that this is a step in the right direction."

          "content": "Marvel has performed a serious course correction with Thunderbolts. After the CGI orgies that were Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Thor: Love and Thunder and Ant-Man & the Wasp: Quantumania, it appears that the producers have learned their lesson (let's hope it lasts).We saw initial efforts in this direction in Captain America: Brave New World, but in Thunderbolts we have a more focused, grounded story. Gone is the heavy-handed messaging, the genius girl teenagers, the spectacle over story.What we are given is a group of dysfunctional, sub-par superheroes (super-ish heroes?) who are thrown together and forced to work together to survive. The echoes of Guardians of the Galaxy are strong.And we also have Bob.The difference from other recent Marvel movies is summed up by the street battle in New York. In Dr Strange, a big CGI tentacle monster turns up and the fight begins. Vehicles are thrown about, buses cut in two, explosions. There is no audience investment, only big flashy CGI spectacle.Thunderbolts builds to this scene. The audience understands what the odds are, the motivations and the stakes. Best of all, the action beats are relatable; saving one child from falling masonry is more impactful than destroying a whole building.More like this please..."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* gets plenty energetic and running, in that the whole Guardians of the Galaxy ragtag sort of team up - only that we know said characters at play - finally hits ensemble buzz for former supporting characters and television debuts (\"De\" Fontaine Allegra-edly showed up first in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier). Based on how this started, might as well have stuck with the title, Yelena and gang. Trailers thankfully saved the best for later, only that a little more runtime would have juiced things better. There was certainly no overlooking Taskmaster's fate as many speculated, but that Thunderbolts* gets most of it bizarrely breezing through is what complements the whole superpowerless sidekick smackdown that this eventual uncanny friends group goes for.Who might the truthful villains be? Valentina just sitting her odds? Nice guy Sentry that defeats rather than destroy? Dark Sentry that sideshow Bob (Easter egg inbound) nearly falls for? All odds considered, the ensemble isn't superhuman. It was one thing for Bob to test his powers intruding on several people's worst memories, and another for John Walker to be cussed at, and to go into rage mode in the beginning. Perhaps that was the whole catch behind the final hug. Don't unleash the villain in someone when you can?. Aww. Valentina did get the \"So adorable\" right.This is an unpopular standpoint, I liked Brave New World better. This is a promising movie, could have easily benefitted with a bigger final showdown but is just as good and potentially great keeping in mind that we have ourselves an underpowered team up minus Sentry.As for folks calling this the best Marvel movie in years, well, no, 2021 had Shang-Chi and Spider-Man : No Way Home debut over a 90% aggregate on Rotten Tomatoes and still stay as high. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness debuted in the 80s, Black Panther Wakanda Forever in the 90s, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 initially at 91, Deadpool & Wolverine initially in the 80s, so this misgiving doesn't slip by a hardcore fan.Valentina saved her million dollar question of worth by entitling them the New Avengers? Be that as it may. Bucky did appear in Brave New World, so mentioning Sam Wilson being doubtful in the post credit scene was slightly off. Hey, 2025 can come to a banger close if the Fantastic Four tease at the end means something different in store from this movie, which is good on its own."

          "content": "I know I might be biased. I love Shang-Chi. Guardians of the Galaxy 3. And Deadpool & Wolverine. But The Thunderbolts is different. It seems like Marvel is trying to tell a different story. Something darker. They're digging deeper into the characters' minds rather than just scratching the surface. Like most Marvel movies have done before.Marvel boldly uses marginal characters from previous works. Such as U. S. Agent (John Walker). Ghost. And Taskmaster (RIP) 🙏. It is precisely because they are marginal characters that Marvel can tell a good story. That kind of storytelling has been scarce since Phase 4 and Phase 5. I specifically criticized Black Panther 2. Which was terrible.Take Red Guardian for example. As the \"father\" of Natasha and Yelena. He only appeared in Black Widow before Thunderbolts. People didn't seem to have a deep impression of him. But in Thunderbolts. He really tried to be a good father. Even though he had no blood relationship with his daughters. He began to truly understand them. Walked into their hearts. And accepted their emotional dependence.The only characters that the film focuses on portraying are the heroine Yelena and the Sentry (Bob). Although Bob's portrayal is good. It could be better.The comedy is great. The original encounters between the characters in the first half of the film are great. The fight scenes in this film are better than in the most recent Marvel movie. Captain Falcon. That one was terrible. Even worse than Thor 4. But this film does not have particularly exciting large-scale special effects. The fighting is more realistic.If you're expecting something like the first battle of the original Avengers. The Battle of New York. Then you may be disappointed. In the third act of this film. Marvel used an anti-climax design in the decisive battle.One more thing. Please welcome Thunderbolts: The New Avengers."

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts\" is Marvel's victory over its own production line. He departs from the usual patterns of superhero film history in the cinematic universe and changes the angle, showing us characters who are not immune from death, are not perfect saviors, and who have their dark sides. These are stories about people with a dark past, with severe injuries and internal struggles that they are constantly trying to overcome, and one of them even has an Alter Ego named \"Darkness\", who eventually takes control of the whole of New York, gaining all the inhabitants to eternal torment their most terrible nightmares. We understand heroes because we have our own Darkness - each of us has our own scars, our own battles, our own hidden dark corners. And that's what makes them incredibly human, the kind you can kind of associate yourself with.The main strength of the Thunderbolts is in their characters. They are unusual, strange, sometimes even repulsive in their flaws, but at the same time incredibly alive and real. Their relationship is a complex, multi-layered drama that clings to the soul. Each of the characters carries his own burden - guilt, fear, hope. Some of them are looking for a way to redemption, while others, having lost hope, only continue to reap what they have sown, while simultaneously sowing new seeds - creating an eternal cycle. There is a place for pain and compassion, for mistakes and forgiveness in their stories. We know this too, because we all carry our scars and struggle with our shadow. These heroes are mirrors for us, only with a deeper wound and more difficult and deadly battles. It's easy for us to empathize with them, because their inner conflict, their weaknesses and fears are what makes them so close and understandable.Visually, the film is very strong and impressive. It is dominated by practical effects, which is why realism is twisted to the maximum, and everything feels real. I would especially like to highlight the scene of the battle with the Sentry - it was shot in one frame, and it is a visual delight.The humor in the film is accurate and relevant. He does not knock down the tone, does not turn the drama into a farce, but fits seamlessly into the story, emphasizing the vulnerability of the characters and their humanity. It is especially worth highlighting the Red Guardian (old Santa Claus) - his image, performed by David Harbor, is simply magnificent. He is funny, touching and very lively at the same time. His naivety and humor make him a real highlight of the film. Yes, sometimes they went too far with humor, but on the whole it was appropriate and organic. «WE ARE THE THUNDERBOLTS»\nMusical accompaniment is generally a separate thrill. Each composition hit the nail on the head: the atmosphere, style, mood - everything is in place. My respect, as they say.This film is imperfect, just like his characters - lively, contradictory, real, and sometimes not telling something. The only significant disadvantage, it seems, is its small timing. Just two hours is not enough. I want to stay with these characters longer, understand them even more deeply, immerse myself in their inner world and enjoy each of their stories (Kamon, the Ghost's past was not even shown).In summary, I would like to say that despite the superhero wrapper, the film is primarily a story about a family. But this is not a fantastic, far-from-reality family like in Guardians of the Galaxy. Everything here is closer to the earth, to our feelings and experiences. This is a story about people who, despite conflicts, misunderstandings and their own dark sides, learn to trust each other and become a real family. And it's this idea that even the most wounded and imperfect people can find each other and become close that strikes a nerve, damn it."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is a new superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie is directed by Jake Schreier, known for Robot & Frank and Paper Towns.Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) is hired for a new mission by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). During this mission, she crosses paths with other anti-heroes and villains such as John Walker (Wyatt Russell) and Ava Starr, a.k.a. Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). When they discover the mission was a trap, they decide to work together. But as villains and anti-heroes, they must first learn to trust each other before they can take revenge and stop a greater threat.With this film, Marvel takes a new direction. The story focuses more on anti-heroes and villains from previous films and series. As a result, the film somewhat resembles a Suicide Squad movie from the DC universe.Marvel films are known for their comedic undertone, but in this film, that tone is deliberately toned down. Instead, the focus is more on the dramatic and emotional sides of the characters, each of whom is marked by trauma and loss. It's refreshing to see Marvel daring to tell these kinds of stories. Nevertheless, there is still humor present, along with recognizable elements for loyal Marvel fans. In this way, the film also feels like a return to older Marvel movies.Due to the smaller scale of the film, the visual effects stand out well. Although the CGI is still noticeable during some explosions, the smaller story requires fewer of them. Most of the characters also don't have actual superpowers, meaning fewer visual effects are needed. For the characters who do have supernatural abilities, the effects are fitting and convincingly executed.The film takes place on a smaller scale and doesn't become unnecessarily large or bombastic, as was sometimes the case with earlier Marvel films. This allows more room for the events and characters to feel more personal. Some characters who previously had only minor roles now get the chance to develop further-though not all of them receive equal attention.Florence Pugh stands out as the most prominent character. She convincingly portrays the dramatic and emotional aspects of her role. Themes such as loneliness, emptiness, and meaninglessness are subtly explored-feelings that many people may find relatable. Together with David Harbour, she shares a number of powerful scenes that reflect this. Harbour also provides lighter moments without undermining the drama. His comedic input keeps things balanced, making the film enjoyable to watch."

The forced, cringeworthy humor is gone. The hollow tokenism is gone. No more aimless leaping across universes and timelines-superheroes are back where they belong, interacting within the city, grounded in human stakes. Character arcs have returned. Tough but lovable personalities have returned. Creative storytelling and polished visual effects have made a comeback.This film achieves almost everything The Avengers (2012) did-but with none of the years-long buildup. Thunderbolts* introduces, develops, and highlights all its characters in a single outing, and somehow it doesn't feel rushed or uneven. It gets newcomers to care and longtime fans to reconnect-and that's honestly astonishing.I'm especially glad to see John Walker staying true to the character we saw in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. I've always liked him. And as for Bucky, I'm relieved this film salvaged what was nearly ruined in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, bringing back the cool, formidable Winter Soldier we once knew."

          "content": "They finally got it right - and it feels genuinely refreshing to say that about a Marvel film after a looooong time.Thunderbolts immediately piqued interest with its oddball crossover of characters on screen, but what truly caught my attention was the creative team behind it. With several A24 alumni helming key roles in direction, writing, and cinematography, this film promised something different. On paper, it shouldn't work - these characters all come from projects that weren't exactly beloved, and the film looked like Marvel's attempt to tie up loose ends. But against all odds, it works beautifully, and that's largely thanks to the sharp, layered screenplay.The writing brings back the essence of early Marvel : scenes that aren't just expositional filler, but ones that drive character arcs forward with real emotional weight. Every character gets their moment, and even if you walked in not caring about them, chances are you'll leave feeling otherwise. Most impressively, the screenplay doesn't undercut its emotional beats with out-of-place jokes-something recent Marvel entries have stumbled over. Thunderbolts knows how to balance its levity with respect for its darker themes.Another thing I truly appreciated was that the superheroes actually did superhero things. Not just the usual city-levelling battles against world-ending villains, but something more grounded and human. There's a soulful five-minute sequence where the team focuses solely on saving civilians. Yes, actual people - not just punching through chaos, but actively helping. That moment reminded me why we admire superheroes in the first place. It was touching, impactful, and a sorely missed element in recent MCU outings.One of the standout examples of the film's depth is Sentry. For the first time in ages, we get a character who isn't just a villain, but a conflicted human being wrestling with deep emotional turmoil. His duality with The Void is haunting, and the visual storytelling used to explore that relationship is mesmerizing, especially on the big screen. If you have access to IMAX, don't think twice; the expanded aspect ratio is used masterfully to enhance the drama.The action sequences deserve a spotlight of their own. You'd think compelling action would be a given in a superhero film, but we know that's not always the case. Here, the choreography is fluid, inventive, and refreshingly easy to follow. Instead of chaotic cuts, the film leans into wide, drawn-out shots, and there's a single-take sequence, a proper oner that's nothing short of iconic.In the end, Thunderbolts is more than just a fun, popcorn-fueled superhero flick. It offers a rich, emotionally grounded story that explores themes like depression and childhood trauma without losing its sense of entertainment. It's a film that lingers in your mind and signals a promising shift for the MCU. If this is the direction they're headed, then Fantastic Four might just have a solid foundation to build on."

          "content": "Thunderbolts is Marvel's most grounded film in years-an ensemble piece that ditches skybeams and world-ending CGI storms in favor of trauma, tension, and team dynamics. It's not perfect, and its pacing struggles early on, but there's a sincerity here that makes it a rare standout in Marvel's post-Endgame era.Florence Pugh once again proves why she's one of the most compelling actors in the MCU. As Yelena, she brings emotional depth, biting humor, and an authenticity that anchors the film. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, too, is an asset-adding an unpredictable charm to her scenes that balances the film's darker undertones.Surprisingly, Thunderbolts dives into themes like loneliness, post-traumatic healing, and the desperate search for identity and belonging. It's emotionally resonant in a way Marvel rarely dares to be-perhaps the most heartfelt outing since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. There's room for quiet moments, strong visuals, and surprisingly well-timed humor that doesn't feel forced. A few action scenes, while smaller in scale, hit hard because they're tied to character rather than spectacle.However, the film stumbles in structure. The first half feels meandering, as if the plot is slowly dragging all the characters into place before the actual story can begin. Once it does, the narrative pushes the team from one contrived twist to another. The stakes feel oddly hollow-built around vaguely defined threats that lack urgency or emotional consequence.The inclusion of The Sentry and The Vault feels more like setup than substance. Fans of these characters may be disappointed with how little they're given to do, but there's a sense they're being positioned for more impactful roles in future projects.This isn't a bombastic return to Marvel's peak form, but it's a sincere attempt to shift tone, scale, and emotional focus. Think of it as a $200 million therapy session for damaged antiheroes-and for the audience, too, after years of forgettable blockbusters. Still, as refreshing as some of the ideas are, the film fades from memory quicker than it should. You'll feel something in the moment-but likely won't carry it with you for long.Thunderbolts is Marvel's first real course correction in years. It's far from flawless, but it dares to be smaller, sadder, and more human. That's worth something-even if the taste it leaves behind doesn't linger."

However, with Thunderbolts* they seem to have broken free from their slump! This film has the potential to be the best Marvel production in recent years.The fight scenes were vastly superior to those in Brave New World. There were no dull moments-the stunts were skillfully performed, and the villain was undeniably overpowered. This is ironic, considering the Thunderbolts* aren't exactly the heroes you'd choose to face someone like Sentry.Sentry's backstory delves deeply into mental health struggles. His immense powers and abilities starkly contrast with the vulnerabilities of his mind. Enter The Void-a manifestation of his anxiety, depression, and self-destructive tendencies-which perfectly opposes the Thunderbolts*. While Sentry is consumed by internal battles, the Thunderbolts*-branded as weaklings-fight tirelessly for survival and purpose, making their resolve inspiring until the very end.Marvel has truly redeemed themselves with this entry. It stands out as one of the best they've released in recent years."

          "content": "Thunderbolts is a return to Marvel greatness; it's well-acted and written and isn't your typical smash-up Avengers movie, but a commentary on PTSD, mental illness and the loneliness that both bring on. This is mostly Yelena's story, as she struggles with the loss of her sister and how to reconnect with her father Red Guardian. Harbor is fabulous and his comedy is gold, especially when he and Bucky start to hang out. I also really liked Russell's extended story, but it's the whacky Pullman who really makes Bob shine. This is also his movie and his chemistry with Pugh is outstanding. I know it's crazy, but this is the best MCU movie since Endgame. It has something to say without being GOTG3 depressing, it's not glib as D&W, and just beats Shang-Chi and No Way Home. Stick around for 2 end credit scenes, especially the latter. Marvel has a hit on their hands, perfectly setting up Fantastic Four and reminding us that they still know how to make great superhero films."

          "content": "There's a million and one things to be said about this movie. Majority of which is overwhelmingly positive. I actually watched it twice, basically back to back, and no I'm not joking.The whole theme of the movie, as shown in the trailers is about a darkness, a void within that comes from loss, from mistakes of the past, from regret.These misfits, who have all got their fair share of baggage, having seen the worst of the world, somehow get put together with the task of saving the world. And boy do they do a hell of a job doing it.There's too much, but also not enough to be said about everyone's acting. From Florence Pugh to Sebastian Stan, who act -and have always acted- with their eyes alone, to Lewis Pullman, whom I was so pleasantly surprised by, the cast is on point every step of the way. The chemistry between the actors, but also their roles absolutely beautiful.The plot flows well, from one character to another, their story, bringing them together, seeing them go from strangers to something more is amazing. It's the little things, that pile up. And that's exactly what this whole movie is about. The things in life, good or bad, that shape them, how life gives and takes without asking and how each person has to find their footing through it all.The fighting scenes are magnificent, not too fast to feel rushed, not too slow to bore you. A smooth dance of movements and choreography that's not been seen in a few years.The humor is on point, every time. It is just enough to make you chuckle when you need to, not cringy, not too much to feel forced. Perfectly placed lines to make you snort a laugh every now and again.The one reason why I'm not giving it a perfect rating, is that I believe it was a great opportunity to delve a bit more into everyone's darkness, but I understand that the movie wouldn't be 2 and a half hours if they did. There was a story to be told in this movie and they delivered. I really hope to see more of this, for the characters to push further, deeper, into everything that was shown.I cannot recommend this movie enough."

          "content": "Thunderbolts is an entertaining ride from start to finish. It never feels boring or dragged at any point. While the first 10 to 15 minutes might take a little time for some viewers to connect with the story and characters, once the film picks up, it doesn't slow down at all. Every moment of the movie is enjoyable and keeps you engaged. The performances by all the actors are spot-on. Each one does justice to their character, and none of them feel out of place or disappointing. The film wisely avoids stretching characters that fans were never really fond of, giving more screen time to the ones that truly matter. Character development is handled exceptionally well, which is a testament to the strength of the writing. The screenplay impresses both in terms of emotional depth and humor. The emotional and comedic moments are well-balanced and never undercut each other. You can clearly feel that the director has given their 100% to the project - the direction is tight, and there's no noticeable flaw in how the story is presented. One of the film's biggest strengths lies in its cinematography and background score. Both are stunning and help elevate the overall cinematic experience. The visuals draw you deeper into the narrative, and even the end credits - especially the magazine cover visuals - look beautifully crafted. Overall, aside from a few minor issues, Thunderbolts is a solid film that delivers on most fronts. I would confidently rate it 8 out of 10."

It was really unnecessary and why even include her if she is done in the first ten minutes. It didn't give anything to the plot. And about giving nothing to the plot. Bucky. I expected to see him more but he was not essential to the plot. Then Bob whose powers are still not clear to me. Everything about him was super vague. I did like this thing with shadows though very dramatic. And of course Yelena. I love her character but she is giving hot and cold. First \"I'm a secret spy who lives in a shadow\" then \"i want to have an image and be a public figure\", \"i am a cold blooded assassin\" then \"i want to be a hero\", \"all avengers are posers\" then \"I guess I am an avenger now\". And i get that it is kind of a character development but it just happened so fast and without any reasoning so it just feels wrong. But even despite all that it is still a good movie. It was pretty dark, sarcastic and funny at times. This is definitely not objective. I rate it this way mostly because I wanted to see taskmaster and Yelena is not what I expected. I'd give it a 7.5/10."

On the one hand, the movie has a meaning and essence, presented in a clear and bright way, on the other hand, the plot is dynamic and there are many humorous moments.What I liked most was how expressively the characters were shown. Each of them has a chance to be remembered, both in character and in appearance. Of course, in the foreground we have Yelena, Valentina and Bob. However, I also liked how the images of the Red Guardian, Walker and Ava Star were shown.Walker has undergone changes in his image, from more uneven in the series, he leaned towards the dark side in this film. However, I think it works in his favor to create a contrast with the other characters and more clearly show Walker as an antihero who considers himself a hero.Red Guardian largely plays the role of a comic character, so they almost overdo it. It's good that he can show himself from a more serious and menacing side. His jester mask is just a way to hide his own fears and escape from the responsibility that disgusts him.Taskmaster's fate, obviously rewritten, is nevertheless well woven into the plot to reveal why Ava Star decides to change her fate and become good.I will not write much about the main characters - Yelena, Valentina and Bobby. The whole film is about them. It is difficult to single out one of them, but I will try) Valentina Alegra de Fontaine is simply an ideal villain, who, at the same time, does not have superpowers. Her charisma differs from Yelena's, who, in turn, is a deeper character, but every frame with de Fontaine is simply gorgeous!I will not give 10/10, since in places there are lazy dialogues and bad graphics. However, according to the plot, it looks like a breath of fresh air."

We pretty much knew what the story and all was going to be but still everything appears brilliant.At the end of the movie I felt like an ungrateful person who would call this experience average just because of a lack of an 'Ending kick'.

That first intruduction in that bunker where they had all their targets to kill, that was really good.Even tho...I havent expected at all that they would kill Taskmaster that quickly.

Walker's arc was surprisingly heartfelt-he starts seeing people as individuals, not just tools. Ava finally finds a place to call home. Bucky, in my opinion, has never felt more purposeful. And Alexei... well, Alexei is just peak Alexei-funny, raw, and unforgettable.Lewis Pullman makes a jaw-dropping MCU debut as Sentry/Void. His portrayal balances the fine line between hero and villain so well that I FELT like I was watching two souls trapped in one body-exactly what the character demands.With sharp writing, emotionally charged performances, and some seriously punchy dialogue, this movie is a banger from start to finish.And whatever you do-stick around for the post-credit scene.

With so much emotional touch, film leaves us with a deep message within. Now with multiverse and Void both being added in MCU, we sure know they are gonna cook something in near future. Keeping Yelena in lime light but still making sure they don't spoil Bucky's aura is actually a good call, otherwise we've seen Disney's woke era spoils the male lead and keeps pushing the female lead, though being equal is also an option. Now with these new \"Avengers\" being introduced, we also need to wait how Falcon's story is narrated in mcu. I would say, as a MCU fan since 2012, this was a great experience and it leaves whole lot of doors open in MCU for future projects."

A complaint many people had with the last movies and series is that every villain wanted to destroy the world. That's obviously not gonna happen in a standalone story (prolly not even an avengers movie) so there where basically no stakes. This time it's the same but because the characters are so amazing and heartfelt (and knowing anybody could die any minute) you really root for them even though you know everything's gonna be fine in the end (in the grand scheme of things. A thing I especially liked is the climax. The villain isn't beaten because Bucky punches him harder than before but because every character realizes not everything is their fault and makes amends. Every character arc is resolved with the final group hug. And so even though the movie ends kinda abruptly there is no need for an epilogue because what the writers wanted the heroes to do was already achieved. To challenge their view of themselves with a character that resembles them in many ways."

The mirroring of her sadness and feeling of not belonging is mirrored really well in other parts of the movie.Even through it's a magical kind of villain we get a very grounded story with good combat, good visuals which I have not said in a while for Marvel, great score and GOOD comedy. Ofc it goes a tad too much BUT not to the extent I'm usually sick of.The first 1hr 40 is the best, it was a great time, the end is good but I do feel potentially a different track could have been taken or I don't know the payoff just missed that something special for me which would have pushed the rating more.Overall a very enjoyable Marvel movie, jumping between a 7.5 and an 8 but I have left the cinema having very much enjoyed it, 8/10."

          "content": "In various ways this is a sequel to the Black Widow solo movie. As such it features more of the sweet yet sad relationship between Alexei(the humor, including with him especially when it's more than just the two of them, can get grating) and Yelena. If this has a protagonist it is definitely the latter, and Florence Pugh continues to do amazing work here. The acting in general is amazing. In some ways this is like a toned down version of FX's Legion. There is psychological exploration of traumatized people who have skills or even superpowers, some of it visual. It is the most unique aspect and probably the best reason to watch.If you're primarily wondering whether this is important to the overall story, there is some stuff but less than you might hope for. The action is great and they do an admirable job making it varied considering that almost all they can have these people do is hand to hand and shoot. One standout is a top down sequence. Another reminded me of Splinter Cell. There are bits where multiple characters fight at the same time that are quite good. The special effects are convincing when they really need to be. I appreciated the criticism of both the feckless establishment Democrats in opposition and obviously the worse Trump and his running the country into the ground. Recommended. 8/10."

          "content": "Jake Schreier's entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Thunderbolts delivers a refreshing and morally ambiguous perspective on the superhero landscape. Instead of the usual lineup of established heroes, this film assembles a compelling team of anti-heroes and reformed villains, each with their own unique skills and complicated pasts. Tasked with a mission that blurs the lines between right and wrong, the Thunderbolts offer a grittier and more unpredictable dynamic, injecting a welcome dose of cynicism and dark humor into the MCU formula. Schreier masterfully balances the individual character arcs with the overarching narrative, creating a cohesive and engaging ensemble piece.The strength of Thunderbolts lies in its fascinating and flawed characters. From Yelena Belova's sharp wit and lethal efficiency to Bucky Barnes's haunted past and reluctant heroism, each member brings a compelling backstory and internal conflict to the group dynamic. The film wisely dedicates time to exploring their motivations and the uneasy alliances they forge, making their interactions both tense and surprisingly human. The action sequences are impactful and well-choreographed, showcasing the diverse abilities of the team members while remaining grounded in the characters' individual fighting styles. The film doesn't shy away from the moral complexities of their missions, forcing both the characters and the audience to question traditional notions of heroism.Visually, Thunderbolts adopts a slightly more grounded and gritty aesthetic compared to some of the MCU's more cosmic offerings. The cinematography emphasizes the characters' internal struggles and the often morally gray areas they operate in. The production design effectively blends familiar MCU elements with a distinct visual identity that suits the team's unconventional nature. The score complements the film's tone, shifting between moments of intense action and quieter, more introspective character beats. Schreier's direction demonstrates a keen understanding of pacing and character development, allowing the story to unfold organically and the relationships between the team members to evolve believably.Ultimately, Thunderbolts proves to be a bold and exciting addition to the MCU. By focusing on a team of flawed individuals striving for redemption (or at least a lesser degree of villainy), the film offers a compelling exploration of heroism from an unexpected angle. With its strong ensemble cast, well-executed action, and morally nuanced narrative, Thunderbolts delivers a thrilling and thought-provoking cinematic experience that expands the scope of the MCU in exciting new directions. It's a welcome reminder that sometimes, the most interesting heroes are the ones who walk the edge."

          "content": "I went into this movie with no expectations. It wasn't until the A24 trailer released that I felt excited enough to commit to seeing this at the cinema (unlike Brave New World which I will be watching on Disney+ when it releases). Sebastian Stan and Florence Pugh are fantastic actors, and The Winter Soldier is one of my favourite characters in the franchise. So, I figured why not give this movie a chance, despite the sting of unenjoyable messes that Disney has released to the world since Endgame.It's difficult to explain the problems with this film without spoilers, and so I'm simply going to reflect my main frustrations.Firstly, nothing in this movie makes any sense. None of the characters behave in ways that are consistent with their characters or even build any sense of character. Any character could be saying what's being said or be doing what's been done. All that changes is the skin. These characters are pulled through a pre-written storyline that offers them no growth or development. They move to the next place where the story needs them to be. And we, the audience, and simply meant to accept that.Secondly, this movie acts darker than it actually is. Attempts to tackle challenging and complex issues are wrapped in Disney's usual comedy wrapper, and the events of the movie essentially eradicate any real feeling of depth. Remember when Quantumania ended and you were left expecting something \"more\" to happen to match the threat that had been presented? That!Thirdly, this movie relies far too heavily on the talent of the cast to sell it. Time and time again, this movie sets up what could have been genuinely memorable moments...only to rip them away.Overall, this movie is a very low risk-low reward installment. If you enjoyed Quantumania, Iron Man 2, Black Widow, and Thor 4, you might rate this movie quite highly. If you were expecting something new, dark, and risky, you'll be disappointed."

This movie rectified that. Depression, suicidal ideation, apathy, loneliness and all of it was kept there without trying to make you turn away or think it funny.They make you sit with the agony on yelenas face seeing how much her past affects her as well as everyone else. This gave me the emotional sincerity that's always been missing in the majority of mcu projects. The most human marvel has felt in a long time. Solid 8/10."

          "content": "I'll keep it short, but there's a lot to say here. Despite all the hype, I found the film to be largely underwhelming, especially when it came to one of the most anticipated characters: Sentry. Fans had been speculating for months about his role, imagining how his arrival would shift the balance of power in the MCU and introduce a truly complex, unstable force to the narrative. Instead, what we got was a watered-down version of the character with little substance and even less impact. Sentry didn't bring anything new or compelling to the table. His screen time was limited, his backstory was glossed over, and his powers, while visually impressive at moments, ultimately felt hollow because there was no emotional or narrative weight behind them. It was a classic case of style over substance, and the result was disappointing.On the flip side, Florence Pugh was absolutely amazing. She continues to be a standout in everything she does, and this film was no exception. Her character brought much-needed energy and charisma to every scene she was in. There's a natural authenticity in her performance that makes her incredibly watchable. Whether she was delivering dry humor or engaging in intense action sequences, she was always believable and grounded. She managed to rise above the script and direction, giving the audience something to actually care about. If there was one redeeming aspect of the film, it was her.Unfortunately, even Florence's strong performance couldn't save the film from feeling like a very big anti-climax. The buildup promised so much-massive stakes, game-changing reveals, and emotional payoff. But what we got instead was a third act that fizzled out rather than exploded. It was all far too safe, far too predictable. It felt like the writers were more interested in setting up future projects than giving this story a satisfying conclusion. Key moments that should have been shocking or powerful just kind of... happened, and then moved on. There was no time to process or feel anything, and that left the entire experience feeling emotionally flat.The post-credit scene was the final nail in the coffin. Predictable and uninspired, it felt like something we've seen a dozen times already. Instead of giving us a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come or throwing in a twist to get people talking, it simply reinforced what we already knew. It was more of a checklist item than a genuine hook. At this point, Marvel's post-credit scenes are starting to feel obligatory rather than exciting, and this one was no exception.And perhaps the most disappointing part of all was the film's over-reliance on the tired \"power of friendship\" trope. That theme can be powerful when executed well, but here it felt forced and unearned. Characters who barely had chemistry or meaningful development were suddenly treating each other like lifelong allies. There was no gradual build-up, no significant shared experiences that would justify the level of trust and emotional weight the film tried to place on their relationships. It came across as a lazy shortcut to emotional payoff, rather than something the characters or the audience had actually earned.In the end, this film had potential. It had great actors, intriguing characters, and the chance to do something bold. But instead, it played it safe and leaned on formulaic writing and hollow spectacle. With a better script and stronger direction, it could have been a standout entry. But as it stands, it's just another forgettable installment that will be quickly overshadowed by what's coming next."

          "content": "Thunderbolts has been hailed by numerous critics as a return to Phase 1 form. I am inclined to agree and that is something of a double edged sword. While this is a better film than we've seen in a while, with an emotional core held together by Florence Pugh, it's also dull at times, with a story that's not very interesting and something of a lack of focus. It also features either fairly interesting characters or characters that don't feel much like they matter. But the biggest issue is that, while it tries to make you think that this is a next step for the MCU, it doesn't really live up to that image.This is Marvel's attempt to bring a B-team of anti-heroes together under the guise of betrayal by their boss, Valentina, introduced at the end of Black Widow and played to scene chewing perfection by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. This pulls Yelena, Ghost (Ant-Man and Wasp), Walker (Falcon and The Winter Soldier), Taskmaster (Black Widow) together, while they are later joined by Red Guardian and Bucky to round out the team. They mostly come together around new character Bob, one of the better new characters here. Bob's development leads to an emotionally charged part of the movie, which was a pleasant surprise. At it's heart, this becomes about mental health and it's where we get the best character development from. Again, that's a mixed bag though. Taskmaster gets the shortest end of the stick, followed by Ghost, who barely does anything besides kick some ass and walk around acting annoyed. Walker is mostly an egotistical jerk the entirety of the film and it feels like he had more development in the Disney+ series than this movie. As an antagonist, Valentina might as well have a moustache to twirl because she hams it up as your fairly typical power hungry government leader.Giving us almost the opposite are Lewis Pullman as Bob, the only character that feels like they might actually be human here. His story is sympathetic and he gets the best turn as the most fully rounded character. David Harbour as Red Guardian has some good moments, but is mostly there for comedic relief and he's very good at it. Florence Pugh gets the meat of it though, with Yelena having a good mix of action, comedy, and relatable character development. However, besides the good character development bits, there isn't much to write home about. The action is decent, but nothing we haven't seen before and pales in comparison to the best of what we've seen from the MCU. The story feels a bit like an afterthought. Bob is at the heart of the story and, although he has plenty of good emotional moments, has a journey that is all too familiar.Maybe the film's biggest problem is in it's trying to sell us on these characters having a bigger role in the MCU when they have the same issue as so many others: they simply don't compare to those before them. They are, in part, supposed to fill in gaps left by the Avengers, much in the same way that we've seen other characters post-End Game try to do and they just aren't there. Walker remains a poor man's Captain America (of which we already have a new Captain America and he's much better for the role, Ghost feels she doesn't have much to offer besides some cool abilities. Yelena makes for a good, new Black Widow, but no one on the team compares to the heavy hitter on the Avengers. Well, besides one character I won't name here, but they come the closest. This wouldn't be an issue if we weren't being sold on them being, in part, replacements. But the film wants us to believe it and I simply don't.Overall, while this does try to capture that Phase 1 spirit, and in some sense does with some great emotional beats, but it also feels very much like a very average MCU movie. Not the worst, but far from the best. It just kind of is and, like so many of the MCU's efforts since End Game, is fairly forgettable once you leave the theater."

While there have been bad and annoying actors in this type of cheesy film before, at least they are usually hot. That isn't the case here.Those serious shortcoming aside, the plot manages to be somehow both convoluted with characters who don't get a real introduction who apparently mean something, but also stupidly simple.Outside of this, the action, which could at least make an otherwise bad action film middling, is really not good at all.I don't get it?

To me it felt like Marvel and Disney cheaped out, so no Red-Hulk, no Punisher, no Zemo, no Abomination, no Deadpool or Hawkeye...or any other super powered or more \"A-List\" characters of Marvel lore who served as a Thunderbolt.Now look the Thunderbolts in comics never had a true staple members like the Avengers - ie Iron Man, Cap and Thor - so the film definitely has that benefit of being \"it's own thing\" for the big screen, but still...a bunch of super soldiers, assassins and one \"phasing\" assassin? To me, it just felt like they deliberately didn't want to spend more money on characters that bring the real spectacle.Cause of it, the action is sorely lacking. It's not that it's poorly done, it's just that it's not overly impressive and there isn't much. Throw in a Red-Hulk and then it gets interesting and fun. When the team faces Sentry, it's cool, but imagine if we had just one tank/super powered being, like a Red-Hulk. We could have gotten a really cool Sentry vs Red-Hulk fight, and I personally feel it was a missed opportunity.The story is kind of by the books, but it's executed well to the point where it's not as obvious. I attribute a lot of that with the nuances through the performances of Florence Pugh as Yelena and Lewis Pullman as Bob aka Sentry. Their performances pull some weight and you kinda buy into their bond.It's always nice to see Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier so his presence alone sort of dials up the film a notch. Dave Harbor is used for comedic purposes and for the most part it works, if you've ever read my reviews I hate the formulaic humor they rely on. Hannah John-Kamen and Wyatt Russell are good in the film, although I thought a scene or two that dives a bit deeper into their persona would have helped. We kinda got it was Wyatt's US Agent when he interacts with Sentry but it could have been more layered. Olga Kurylenko's Taskmaster is killed off so quickly, and I feel if you were gonna kill someone off she could have died more meaningfully. It was definitely for pure shock and I personally took it as if Marvel Studios knows that the reception of Taskmaster in the BLACK WIDOW film was not favorable so they just got rid her this quickly.Julie Louis-Dreyfus is scene stealing. She does a really good job making you hate her. But like Wyatt's character we got a taste of her past and I wish the film could have also explored more on why she's like this. Perhaps that'll come down the line.I want to touch on Sentry for a second cause as a reader of comics, Sentry was always a polarizing figure in the fandom. He wasn't exactly well received and it also seemed like the writers didn't know what to do with him either, but I liked the execution here in his live action introduction. For the most part a faithful portrayal. Pullman does a great job being timid and menacing.So at the end of the day, THUNDERBOLTS* brought some serious weight that pushes mental health into the forefront. Most who don't know much would probably not expect it, but it works very well and showcases that these misfits and failures can live up to their potential and be someone. Again, I strongly feel there are missed opportunities of spectacle that could have pushed my comic-book buttons a lot harder. I feel Harrison Ford's Red-Hulk or Tim Roth's Abomination could have easily synced up how they would both seek redemption like some of the characters here.7/10."

          "content": "3.25/5.0 STARS - Was not initially interested in this but eventually decided that I would be checking it out. It was enjoyable in various ways, but there were some shortcomings such as plot conveniences that were difficult to ignore and an odd mis-match between the serious themes explored and the typical (evident since Guardians) style of goofy humor/character interactions that snap you right out of the seriousness of the moment. In some ways it feels like Marvel is dumbing these films down for a much younger, easier-to-please audience and has forgotten about satisfying the adult fans that gave this franchise the legs that it had for so long. And that's unfortunate. I still like Florence Pugh in the role of Yelena, and David Harbor is fun to watch as Alexei. Was good to see Bucky return, but the inclusion of various other characters/storylines means it's necessary to watch at least three other entries in the franchise to get a full appreciation of the story. Those would be: Falcon and the Winter Soldier (terrible show), Black Widow (which I enjoyed a lot), and Ant Man and the Wasp (which was ... okay). This feels like a lot to ask of audience members, to be honest. Fortunately I had seen all three of those, but still. While the overall plot was serviceable, I'm finding it more difficult to buy into the character played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the role of Valentina. The addition of Bill Pullman was okay though. There are two scenes at the end - one during the mid credits and one at the very end. Though one of those teased an upcoming film, I didn't feel particularly moved by it at all with any level of excitement. I think my days of consistently loving the MCU have passed, as I predicted they would when Endgame happened. But at least I didn't leave this film completely annoyed. Just wish it could have felt as solid at the other films. Video review will be available on my YouTube channel."

The dialogue and group dynamic is exactly what you've come to expect, and be bored by, from current MCU offerings. It provides nothing fresh or original, just retreads of previous movies, only with fewer thrills and excitement. The movie is quite timid in its treatment of the Sentry character, who instead of being a genuine global threat, felt like a version of bad Superman with the handbrake firmly on. They seemed too scared to truly make him the \"big bad\", opting instead to water his actions down to a level of \"oops, did I do that?\" And the means of controlling Sentry was verging on the ridiculous in terms of plot. They didn't take the steps needed to make the film better."

Beneath the action and the aesthetics, it carries a message that hits deep: the fight against the emptiness that creeps in during our darkest moments. That quiet, paralyzing feeling that nothing matters, that we're alone in a world that no longer sees us.This film captures that emotional weight beautifully. Each character wrestles with their own version of that void, and in doing so, Thunderbolts becomes a story not just of power, but of pain, courage, and the hope of rebuilding.And like many Marvel films, Thunderbolts brings back one of its most timeless themes: redemption. The belief that no matter how far we've fallen, we deserve another chance. That it's never too late to make a different choice, to heal, to reconnect.The music is just as powerful as the message-elevating each scene, each silence, each turning point. And while the action is sharp and well-executed, it's purposefully restrained. Less noise, more meaning. Unlike many in the Marvel universe, Thunderbolts knows when to be quiet, when to let emotion lead.Marvel movies often get credit for their visual effects and humor-but what makes them truly unforgettable is how they remind us of what it means to be human. Thunderbolts is one of the best examples of that.Absolutely worth watching!!"

          "content": "The MCU has had a rough few years cinematically and Thunderbolts* offers the first sign of hope since James Gunn left that they can still make a great film without the need to rely on multiversal shenanigans. It's a genuine story of depression and redemption where the trademark humour rarely undercuts the emotional beats for once as well as being a superb start to the 2025 summer movie season. It's a satisfyingly straightforward affair with an exciting end credits scene.This is Florence Pugh's film and she is incredible. Yelena has never felt more three dimensional and Pugh strikes the perfect balance of being witty and earnest. All the quips are a clear sign of the character trying to hide the growing feeling of emptiness she's wrestling with, which is even more affecting when combined with Lewis Pullman's Bob. Pullman offers his strongest showcase so far by communicating the duality of Bob's innocence and darker half beautifully.Everyone else doesn't get as much to work with but they're still good in their own ways. David Harbour has the best comedic timing whilst also being vital to the film's biggest emotional moments. Sebastian Stan returns to the role of Bucky in an effortless fashion and Wyatt Russell fully commits to the standoffish nature of John Walker this time. Hannah John-Kamen gets the least to do however she remains a welcome addition to the team.Thankfully, all the A24 talent Marvel was keen to brag about in the marketing hasn't been squandered. Jake Schreier's direction and Andrew Droz Palermo's cinematography ensures this one looks and moves in a much more cinematic way than usual with dynamic uncommonly practical action sequences, a predominantly grey colour palette that pops and a highly inventive third act. The score by Son Lux is also able to standout thanks to its unique sounds."

David Paymer (hope got name right, trying to remember them all) is great as Elena's washed-up eager father The Red Guardian and it's fun to see the Ghost from Ant-Man and The Wasp show up for some sleek fight scenes, but wow never did a Marvel movie feel so going through the motions.

          "content": "Thunderbolts (2025) :\nMovie Review -The Avengers have bowed out, and the Thunderbolts step in. The film has leaned heavily into this tagline, so it hardly needs reiteration here. Still, it's fair to say the movie tries to build a new ensemble using familiar concepts-some of which work, while others fall short. The story follows a group of underdogs uniting to become a team. The narrative leans more into their emotional and moral defeats, but as long as the resolution lands, that's forgivable. Sounds a bit corny? Perhaps. But rest assured, Thunderbolts isn't outright dull. If you can handle some outdated melodrama and a mediocre antagonist, then this film may just be worth your time.CIA Director Valentina de Fontaine dispatches Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), and Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) on what turns out to be a suicide mission-meant to eliminate them and bury her wrongdoings. They survive the ambush, though Taskmaster is killed by Ghost, and a mysterious figure named Bob (Lewis Pullman) enters the picture. Thanks to Bob, the group escapes. They are later joined by Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) and eventually Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), and the newly formed Thunderbolts decide to take down Valentina. Their journey leads them to the revelation that Bob has been transformed into the superhuman entity known as the Sentry. In their confrontation with him, they are swiftly defeated. The question remains: can they save Bob and defeat what he's become?Eric Pearson's script may not be among the MCU's finest in recent years, but it holds enough weight to keep the audience engaged. Those familiar with other superhero arcs, especially fans of the X-Men, will find the beats predictable-Thunderbolts treads similar territory. The MCU's new phase isn't particularly grand or groundbreaking, but it offers enough firepower to satisfy fans of the individual characters. While the film may feel like a lighter, less polished version of The Avengers, a bit of patience pays off. The climax emphasizes psychological tension over big-budget action, which leaves the viewer both intrigued and a little underwhelmed.Florence Pugh delivers a good performance in the lead, although Marvel's insistence on strong accents undermines the emotional impact of her voicework. Sebastian Stan brings a subdued energy to Bucky Barnes, which might disappoint some fans. Wyatt Russell struggles to gain favor among those loyal to Chris Evans' Captain America-an expected comparison that does him no favors. On the other hand, Lewis Pullman is a delightful surprise, shifting from the Earth's mightiest to its most timid with remarkable range. Olga Kurylenko and Geraldine Viswanathan are competent in their roles; David Harbour is loud yet entertaining; Hannah John-Kamen fits Ghost well; and Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Valentina is part sinister, part powerless-her character caught in a mismatch against the supers.The movie kicks off with a standout action sequence where the four leads-complete strangers-clash in a confined space. It's chaotic, with shifting alliances: one fights two, three attacks one, four goes after three. It's a messy but enjoyable spectacle, elevated by crisp cinematography and a decent score. The visual effects are serviceable but confined to select moments, which is a letdown. Still, those select scenes shine. There's enough action, though not an abundance; enough drama, if not consistently compelling; enough destruction, though not on a massive scale; and enough entertainment to keep things moving. That's Jake Schreier's Thunderbolts in a nutshell: a modest beginning with room to grow. Yet, something feels absent-a signature element, a memorable emotional anchor, or a show-stopping set piece. The Sentry's power surpasses even Thanos, which is astonishing, but the film dilutes his potential impact. Had they leaned into that, Schreier might have delivered a stronger film. Still, Thunderbolts is decent, one-time watch-especially if you're curious about the direction the MCU is heading. And yes, there's a surprise waiting at the end.RATING - 5/10*"

          "content": "After watching it, this movie has definitely entered my top 10 best MCU films. Thunderbolts* proved to be more than just a big-budget superhero (or rather, antihero) action flick. It's a story about confronting your own darkness head-on. The way it explores themes like loneliness, existential emptiness, the lack of purpose or direction in life, unity, and the fear of facing your inner demons was beautiful, deeply moving in many ways, and brilliantly executed.This film tells you that you're not completely alone or lost in life. That you can grow through your pain, and that even the most lost souls can find a new horizon.Yelena is undoubtedly the heart of this movie. Florence Pugh always gives her best with this character, and this was no exception. With this film, Yelena solidifies herself as a key figure in this vast cinematic universe-and as one of my personal favorites.I loved the group dynamics and character development. Before its release, I thought they'd all feel too similar, but seeing them in action proved me wrong. Each one is not only well-written but also has a distinct identity and personality. Together, they share a fascinating chemistry-even more cohesive and compelling than the first Avengers team. Plus, their abilities are used in highly creative ways.Lewis Pullman's performance as Sentry (Bob) was outstanding, and he was undoubtedly the perfect choice for the role. Sentry (Bob) is a three-dimensional antagonist, with multiple facets and layers of depth-something the MCU has been missing in its villains for a long time. I haven't seen such an interesting antagonist since Namor.The action scenes were incredibly well-crafted and inventive.The cinematography is excellent. I love how the color palette is gray and dark-not just to be \"edgy,\" but because it fits the story's tone, adding a narrative layer to the characters' emotional states.The way the conflict was resolved felt very different from anything we've seen in previous MCU films, and that was incredibly refreshing.Thunderbolts* is an action movie with a strong identity, personality, and heart. Every member of this new team won me over in one way or another-I'm excited to see what's next for these characters and to meet them again in the future."

The movie feels more grounded, with practical action scenes that add realism, setting it apart from other Marvel films that rely heavily on CGI.That being said, the villain, Bob Reynolds (aka Sentry), could have been developed more. His backstory and motivations aren't fully explored, which makes it harder to understand why he becomes such a destructive force. This missed opportunity to dive deeper into his character weakens the emotional stakes of the film. Still, Thunderbolts is an enjoyable and fresh take on the superhero genre, and while the lack of a fleshed-out villain holds it back, the character-driven story and strong performances make it worth watching."

Now, we have Thunderbolts* (2025) which is the final entry in Phase 5 and it was much definitely a fantastic way to end this Phase and get us back on track with the MCU.Positives for Thunderbolts* (2025):\nThis is the first time where we have an entry in the MCU that is starting to build up to bigger events in the future and especially for Phase 6. I like how this is a smaller scaled movie from the major blockbuster spectacles that we have gotten for the past couple of years. I really enjoyed the cast of characters with Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Wyatt Russell as John Walker, Lewis Pullman as Robert Reynolds, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov / Red Guardian, Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. I really like how this movie focuses on the mental state of the characters and their past particularly with Yelena. Red Guardian got a lot of great laughs from me and had a lot of awesome one-liners. The action sequences are fun and I like the grounded approach in them as opposed to the larger than life battles in the Avengers movies. And finally, I appreciate that the final battle of this movie is a big CGI fest and instead went for a more personal and internal battle within the characters.Mixed for Thunderbolts* (2025):\nThis movie is basically Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy in a nutshell which is going to be a problem for some people, but it wasn't for me.Overall, Thunderbolts* (2025) is a fantastic movie in the MCU, an awesome way to end Phase 5 of the MCU, it was a great way to get the MCU back on track and we are definitely heading in the right direction of getting back to the glory days of the MCU."

There is emotion and you feel for the characters more. I was so hesitant when the first trailer came out and ended up being surprised by how great it was. Definitely a must see. Sentry was amazing, Yelena was amazing. It is a lot darker than most Marvel movies. It has it moments where the Red Guardian has his humor and moments when he is serious. The only thing I missed is when Walker took the serum. Maybe I missed it The Winter Soilder and Falcon. And I watched it and he ended up growing on me. Must see."

I know everyone who looked at that screen also saw bits of their life there because everyone has their own emotional baggage and in terms of this, Thunderbolts is such a relatable movie. I love psychological movies, so this was a 11/10 for me. Before talking about how amazing, brilliant, show stopping Lewis Pullman was, first I wanna say what an incredible performance Julia Louis Dreyfus gave. I didn't blink during her scenes, because she delivered those lines and Val's confidence so successfully well, Florence Pugh and Julia was the star of this movie for me. Lewis Pullman... I knew he was gonna be fantastic as Sentry but the acting during last scenes, HEART-WRENCHING. I cried as I kept watching because personally his whole life was so relatable to me. Family fights, depression, anxiety, loneliness. I was able to see that in Lewis Pullman's face. That face and posture had such vulnerability yet such resistance, and just like that, he was Sentry for me. Finally, this team is SMASHING AND ICONIC. A bunch of idiots you know just became the most impeccable team you had ever seen. Two negative things I can say, first the ending felt rushed, second the after credits was predictable, yet left you with so many unanswered questions. This is the movie you didn't know you needed."

We get a compact origin story, some great serious topics about tortured souls, grounded action, CGI that actually makes things look better not worse, funny dialogue and a really really good villain.Florence Pugh is the best, but the whole ensamble cast delivers, down to side characters. And we finally get a post-credit scene that isn't an empty promise (goodbye Harry Styles, forever-delayed Blade, Clea, Hercules) but more like the good old Phase 2/3 buildup.What's super refreshing is how the movie actually pokes fun at superhero overload while being a superhero movie itself. It's like they know we're all sick of the same formula but still manage to entertain us. Instead of cramming in 20 heroes for marketing toys, they focus on making these anti-heroes people we actually care about.It's honestly the most fun I've had watching a Marvel movie in years - probably because it doesn't try so hard to be a \"big Marvel event\" and just focuses on being a good movie first."

I know the MCU didn't do a good job adapting the character, and Secret Wars is an opportunity to reset whatever characters they want, but having her just get killed with no impact to the story was certainly a choice.The MCU used to have decent marketing, but between the chairs for Doomsday and the trailers for this? ...they pretty much told us everyone but Taskmaster is going to survive.The whole asterisk thing was also correctly guessed. It was between that and Dark Avengers. No one guessed Sam would sue over the Avengers title. He didn't feel the need to get involved before then?This wasn't a terrible film with zero qualities, but it wasn't a return to form either."

          "content": "In the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), audiences have become familiar with high-stakes action, world-ending threats, and iconic superhero teams. Yet, amidst the galaxy-spanning battles and multiversal chaos, Thunderbolts emerges as a refreshing and gripping entry that redefines what a Marvel movie can be. Without relying on spoilers, it's safe to say that Thunderbolts distinguishes itself as one of the best Marvel films in recent memory by daring to explore darker themes, deeper character dynamics, and a more grounded narrative, all while maintaining the action-packed energy fans expect.One of the key reasons Thunderbolts shines is its commitment to character-driven storytelling. Rather than focusing solely on world-saving stakes, the film zooms in on a team of morally gray characters, many of whom were previously considered side characters or even antagonists in other MCU entries. This shift in focus allows the movie to delve into complex motivations, past traumas, and internal conflicts in a way that feels emotionally raw and refreshingly human. These characters aren't flawless superheroes-they're broken, conflicted, and sometimes even dangerous. And that's exactly what makes them so compelling.The film also benefits from a unique tonal balance. Unlike many recent Marvel movies that leaned heavily into comedy or leaned too far into spectacle, Thunderbolts strikes a tone that is serious without being bleak, mature without being pretentious. It blends tension, action, and introspection in a way that feels more like a gritty ensemble drama than a traditional superhero blockbuster. This tonal shift helps Thunderbolts stand apart from its predecessors and makes its world feel more lived-in and real.The cinematography and visual style of the movie also deserve praise. While many Marvel movies have been criticized for their generic or over-reliant CGI look, Thunderbolts opts for a more practical, grounded aesthetic. The action scenes are brutal and visceral, choreographed with a sense of weight and consequence. The locations feel tangible and authentic, immersing the viewer in a world that is more grounded than the usual glossy MCU backdrops. This visual authenticity adds to the emotional intensity of the story and helps underline the film's more serious tone.Moreover, Thunderbolts succeeds because it isn't trying to be everything at once. Recent MCU entries have struggled with the burden of advancing the larger multiverse narrative while also telling a self-contained story. Thunderbolts, however, largely stands on its own. It has connections to the wider universe, of course, but its plot, character arcs, and emotional payoffs are self-sufficient. This allows the movie to breathe and build a narrative that feels focused and purposeful, rather than overstuffed or distracted.Another major strength of Thunderbolts is the chemistry of its cast. The ensemble is diverse, both in personality and perspective, and the dynamic between characters provides the movie's emotional core. Conflicts feel earned, alliances feel fragile, and every interaction carries weight. Watching this team of misfits try to work together is as thrilling as any explosive action sequence. The film does an excellent job of showing how trust is built-or broken-among people with dark pasts and hidden agendas.Additionally, Thunderbolts taps into timely themes that resonate beyond the screen. It explores redemption, loyalty, power, and the consequences of past decisions. These themes are not just background material-they drive the plot and the characters' development. In a media landscape crowded with shallow spectacle, Thunderbolts dares to ask deeper questions, and in doing so, gives audiences something to think about long after the credits roll.In conclusion, Thunderbolts proves that the Marvel formula can evolve. By focusing on flawed characters, choosing a more grounded aesthetic, and embracing a darker but honest tone, it reinvigorates the MCU. It doesn't rely on nostalgia, cameos, or multiverse madness to earn its place-it earns it through solid storytelling, powerful performances, and a commitment to doing something different. For fans who have been yearning for a more mature, character-driven Marvel film, Thunderbolts is not just a good movie-it's one of the best the MCU has offered in recent years.4o."

Thunderbolts* is a welcome entry to the MCU, perhaps the best since Wakanda Forever and I say that because it didn't carry a gimmick. What Thunderbolts* does do is re-introduce our favourite side characters in a manner that so many of us can relate to and that is mental health, with a focus on what we do and how we fill our 'void' when we feel alone.Thunderbolts* explores new ground with its darker tone whilst following the standard MCU format which for the most part is a wide success.All of the misfit, side characters are reintroduced superbly throughout, which you will understand further when visiting 'The Void'If you are looking for fun, you'll get it, if your looking for action, you'll get it but if your looking to finally reconnect to the MCU and feel that a movie has been made for each and every single one of us, then yeah, you'll definitely get that and some.The MCU didn't forget anything with this movie, all of the fine details are covered when making a superhero movie.There has been a lot of talk about the MCU and the struggle through this phase and for the direction and rightly so, however, if this movie proves anything, it's that MARVEL is back!!! (It never left but it floundered)Do not sleep on this entry, prepare yourself for where we are heading but also be reminded that Thunderbolts* has so many real world values and its superb.Oh and stay for both end credit cuts, they are both very worth it!Lastly, Red Guardian provides as many laughs as Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool! David Harbour is in fine form."

However, the evil head of the CIA has plans on killing them...as her using these misfits sure won't help her image now that Congress is ready to take action against her. But there is one more tool...an unexpected one named 'Bob'. Who is he and how do these misfits all fit together?

Although there were 2-3 less interesting moments, they are dwarfed by the rest of the film. Every scene, including the less interesting ones, contributes to the film, and I wouldn't cut any of them in the editing.The script is also really good. Each of the characters gets their own time on screen and we get to see them in a completely different light. The characters deal with their past and in the process have to save the world, and this conflict works great.The dialogues are really good, the humor works excellently, to the point where I laughed at almost every joke, and the dramatic moments moved me a lot.The action scenes are really good, including one scene that is one of the best action scenes in the MCU.In terms of acting, the actors do a really good job. The one who stands out above all others is Florence Pugh, who manages to introduce a new layer to the character of Yelena. She is funny at the right moments, Bad Ass when necessary, and very moving. I was able to connect with her character more, and there is no doubt that Florence did an excellent job. It seems that the actors came to have fun and it is evident on the screen.The villain, Sentry, is also one of the most successful villains in the MCU, and I am very happy about the fact that we will see the character of Bob in Avengers: Doomsday.And of course, the second scene after the credits is just insane. It left me speechless and I can't wait to see what the consequences are.In conclusion, this is a deep, exciting, and action-packed movie. A quality Marvel movie, which is finally returning to its good old days. How I missed it!"

A rising star.I could have done without the family melodrama between David Harbour's \"Alexi Shostakov\" and \"Yelena\".In short, an easy 30 minute edit could have turned this OK movie into a good movie.The stunts are good (including Pugh's real life fall off the world's second tallest building), the script is average, the fight scenes are meh!It could have delivered something really special, but it felt like a miss not a hit."

The marketing for the movie really made me feel like they were really doing something grounded and carefully developed. Turns out that feeling was absolutely right. Thunderbolts is a wonderfully crafted movie that portrays characters we have seen before in previous titles but in a whole new light. They made me care about each and every character as their backstories are all tragic and unique in their own way making you feel for each and every one in some capacity. This was an element that was sorely missed in other recent titles but Thunderbolts managed to reintroduce that beautifully in its story. On top of the characters themselves this movie had some\nincredible cinematography. You can clearly see the use of practical sets rather then having a green screen and be super CGI heavy, and it truly made you feel apart of the scene a lot more than you would otherwise. Now shifting to the main villain for the movie, Sentry, also known as the void, was brilliant. Lewis Pullman did an incredible job portraying the character(s) in a way that felt true to the comics. On top of that I believe Marvel did a fantastic job showcasing his powers without trying to water him down, and I can say they don't hold back at all. Thunderbolts is exactly what the MCU needed in a time that most of us felt there was not a clear direction and I can proudly say this is the first time in a long time I am excited for the future of Marvel. Go watch this film, you will not regret it. 9.5/10."

          "content": "Let's be honest-Marvel's been in a weird place lately. After Endgame, we got a few hits (No Way Home, WandaVision), but also a fair amount of \"meh.\" Fans were split, energy was low, and a lot of us started wondering if the MCU had finally run out of steam. But then came Thunderbolts-and wow, what a comeback.From the first scene, Thunderbolts feels different in the best way. It's fast, it's fun, and most importantly, it feels emotionally grounded. This isn't just another team-up movie for the sake of fan service. It has real character arcs, solid motivations, and surprisingly heartfelt moments that hit harder than expected.Florence Pugh absolutely dominates the screen as Yelena Belova. She's witty, vulnerable, badass-all at once. Every scene she's in just works, and she brings the kind of charisma that makes you wish the whole MCU revolved around her. Whether she's cracking a joke or breaking down emotionally, she delivers. Easily the MVP.But it's not just the Florence Pugh show. The rest of the cast holds their own. David Harbour's Red Guardian brings the comic relief without it feeling forced, and his dynamic with Yelena adds a touch of emotional depth. The rest of the squad (no spoilers) gets their time to shine too, each with their own quirks and conflicts that make the team chemistry feel organic rather than rushed.What really stands out in Thunderbolts is the tone. It doesn't try too hard to be dark and gritty like some post-Endgame entries, but it also doesn't fall into the trap of nonstop quips and empty action. There's a balance here. The humor lands, but it never overshadows the story. The stakes feel real, and the emotional beats don't feel forced. It's the kind of tone that made movies like The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy so memorable.Action-wise, the film delivers big time. The set pieces are slick, creative, and never overstay their welcome. The choreography feels sharp and purposeful-no blurry punches or CGI overload. Each action sequence serves the story, not just the trailer hype, and that alone puts it above a lot of recent Marvel flicks.Now, is Thunderbolts perfect? Of course not. The villain(s) could've used a bit more depth, and there are a few pacing issues in the second act. Some plot points feel a little rushed, especially when trying to tie in broader MCU elements. But honestly? Those flaws don't drag it down much. The film has so much charm, energy, and heart that you'll likely forgive the bumps along the way.At its core, Thunderbolts is about broken people finding purpose, about second chances, and about what it means to be a hero when you've already messed up. It's surprisingly relatable, even for a superhero film. And that emotional honesty, paired with top-tier performances and tight direction, makes this one of the best Phase 5 entries yet.In short: Thunderbolts isn't just good-it's exactly what the MCU needed. It reminds us why we fell in love with these stories in the first place. It proves that with the right characters, a sharp script, and some actual emotional stakes, Marvel still knows how to deliver a damn good time at the movies.Here's hoping this energy sticks around-because if this is the new MCU vibe, we're all the way in."

Marvel is sometimes that has me looking forward, giving me something to escape into. A world built around amazing characters and their journeys. I will watch anything marvel puts out there because I believe in the story they're trying to tell. This movie felt like the start of something new but familiar at the same time. It was fresh and much needed. The cast did a wonderful job and I can't wait to see them again soon."

          "content": "Okay, let's just start with the obvious: Thunderbolts is like Marvel said, \"Hey, what if we took a bunch of side characters with trauma, tossed them into a group chat, and forgot to turn off Do Not Disturb?\"Sebastian Stan is back as Bucky Barnes, as he trapped in a superhero soap opera, and I love him for it. At this point, he's not even fighting villains he's fighting feelings, bad WiFi, and the fact that he has to babysit a group of unstable super-powered coworkers.But let's talk about the true MVP: David Harbour's Red Guardian. This man is giving dad energy, Soviet nostalgia, and \"forgot my reading glasses again\" vibes in every scene. I laughed every time he opened his mouth. He's like if vodka could talk and had unresolved issues with Captain America.The rest of the cast? Fun! The plot? Let's just say it's there. Somewhere. Like your car keys when you're late. The movie definitely has some \"we ran out of money for CGI\" moments, but it makes up for it with quips, punching, and enough moral ambiguity to keep a philosophy major busy for a week.In conclusion, Thunderbolts isn't winning Oscars, but it is the cinematic equivalent of a group therapy session with explosives, and honestly, I had a fun time.5/10 - because Marvel forgot the plot but remembered the charm."

It has the reliable factor for sure that can out done avengers endgame in comparison. Has so much spark charisma and tells a genuine emotional story that you connected with.

I couldn't fully connect with the characters, and their relationships or personal struggles felt too surface-level. I've seen Marvel films offer more character-driven moments in the past, and I missed that here. Still, as a popcorn-style Marvel film, it was fun and worth the time.

First, we see very little of the Sentry / Void, but that was to be expected, as the Thunderbolts are no match to fight him whatsoever. He is not even on another level, but playing a whole different game.The second thing, which I feared is going to happen due to the trailers, is the stupid early death of Taskmaster. Just why? Atleast give her a good death with a redemption arc, where she sacrifices herself for the team, or something. That was just such a huge waste.Without that, I would give it a solid 7-7.5 stars."

          "content": "When Captain America: Brave New World hit theaters, it left audiences sharply divided. While it had its strengths, in retrospect - especially next to this latest triumph - it feels almost quaint, if not clumsy. To put it bluntly: if Thunderbolts is a symphony, then Brave New World is karaoke night.Against all odds and expectations, Thunderbolts rises as one of the most heartfelt and exhilarating entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in recent memory. What began as a project few truly believed in has blossomed into a cinematic gem - one that balances levity and gravitas with impressive poise.This is a film that dares to be both light and layered, humorous and heartbreaking. It doesn't shy away from emotion - in fact, it revels in it. Laughter and sorrow dance hand in hand here, resulting in a tonal blend that feels remarkably human. One moment, you're doubled over in laughter; the next, your throat tightens with emotion. This isn't just another chapter in Marvel's sprawling saga - it's a statement. One that says: We still have stories worth telling.Director Jake Schreier helms the film with precision and flair, delivering a vision that feels confident, cohesive, and emotionally intelligent. The screenplay is tightly constructed, its pacing deliberate, its character arcs rich with nuance and meaning. The narrative never loses momentum, pulling viewers in and holding them captive until the final frame.Performance-wise, the entire ensemble delivers admirably. Still, it's Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman who dominate the screen - radiating charisma, vulnerability, and depth. And as for Sentry? He's not just a visual spectacle. He's a symbol of what the MCU can still do when it commits. Thankfully, the character is treated with the gravitas he deserves, not cast aside as a mere plot device.At its core, Thunderbolts had a singular mission: to make us care about this eccentric, unlikely team.Mission accomplished. Utterly and completely. Not only do we care - we crave more. Bring on Doomsday.And as for the end credits... let's just say, the surprises are as rewarding as they are tantalizing.A final word of advice: remain seated until the very end of the credits. There are two extra scenes - one mid-credits, one post-credits - and both are well worth the wait. (The Second One is pretty crazy)"

          "content": "Thunderbolts is definitely a breath of fresh air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's focus on mental health is a huge highlight and gives the movie depth and emotion. The film's antagonist, Sentry, represents the dangers of suppressing emotion and bottling yourself up. This gives the movie lots of room to play with the idea of being stuck in your own bad thoughts or memories which I thought was very clever. Sentry's actor, Lewis Pullman does an excellent job brining life to the character and he's one of the more complex villains we've seen in a Marvel movie. Florence Pugh steals the show as Yelena and once again proves she is the best post-Endgame addition to this franchise. Her range here is fantastic and I always love exploring more of the Red Room. In many ways this film serves as a sequel to Black Widow and that is prominent with David Harbour's Red Guardian also getting a lot to do. His dynamic with Yelena is even more fleshed out here and I love their scenes together. I do wish that Bucky, Ghost, and John Walker all had a little bit more to do. For a movie exploring regret and haunted pasts I think Bucky was underutilized. Nobody really has a more traumatic backstory than Bucky and I know over the years we've seen a lot of Bucky dealing with that, but I think giving him some of his own flashbacks like Yelena got in this movie could've been great. I also think the first two acts were paced a bit odd. But I think the third act was absolutely beautiful and I love how they flip the whole final third act fight scene into something much more personal and character focused. This isn't a perfect film but it's very enjoyable, full of heart and one of Marvel's most unique movies."

Thunderbolts* tries to get things back on track by mixing things up, taking a good start by keeping to the roots of the Marvel formula in comedy and action. The movie's first quarter has my favorite action scenes, elements of acrobatic flips, weapon play, and \"powers\" being used by masters to get you locked into the excitement at hand. It's an exciting and explosive first act matched with comedy that feels much like the same MCU schtick that so many films hold. It's fun, flashy, and moves with a good pace that marries storytelling and entertainment. As the film continues, the comedy keeps to the theme while upping the intensity, while the action gets a bit different in terms of \"presentation,\" trading in more of the choreography for those emotional stunt shows.Much of Thunderbolts'* presentation is cleaned up and shiny, Disney's money going strong to fund graphics that make things look realistic (for the most part). The cinematography is gorgeous, constantly evolving as the events transpire to give you an extra flare of emotion that is striking and compelling. Excellent camera work helps capture the perfect emotional aspects at times, some of them a punch to the heart that would be lacking without that incredible artistic pull. Sound effects accompany it with awesome blends of noise as the ear spectacles fight with haunting silence that sometimes accompanies the movie, designing an extra level of immersion that I had to reflect on. Finally, the musical soundtrack helps to fill in more of the gaps, a nice blend of orchestral overtures that shake the walls and the toe-tapping top-hits that are wielded with such samurai precision. When everything comes together, Thunderbolts* feels much more complete than some of the recent entries into the cinematic universe.Story-wise, the movie accomplishes a better level than I anticipated from the trailers. This team of rouges is much more than comedic slurs and flashy moves. No, we are peeling back layers of some of the characters, a brasher dive into the world that is surprisingly better than most of their TV shows in how they handle the mature material. Yelena is much of the story, while Red Guardian and Bob aren't far behind in a film that rounds out the typical superhero leads. The solid acting helps this, performances from talented individuals who know how to own the moment and their characters, and their emotions. Pugh, in particular, has to wear a lot of hats while keeping her accent solid as she faces a lot in this movie from all the movie pieces. Harbour is hilarious as always, his volume alone a shining piece that sells the bravado of the Red Guardian and hits every line. Pullman as Bob was awesome as well, shifting into different levels that felt very comic book-esque and a solid tie to all the characters. Their performances and story are well-integrated into the pace, and this film continues the campaign of tying the questions of old into the new story. It works better than Captain America 4 and has smartly set up pieces for the next big future of the MCU, including the end credits, which are some of the best I've seen in a while. The last scene alone might give a lot away, so just caution, but these were fun and fit well in the film.DISLIKES:\nStill Not The Most Exciting\nThe Character Usage is Crap At Times\nToo Much Comedy\nThe Visuals At Times\nStill A Bit Scattered\nSummary:\nRegarding the areas of improvement, the first thing is a dip in visuals that still shows the limitations of budget, time, and the boundaries of realism. Thunderbolts* action scenes come off fake at times, like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone levels, cheesy and floppy visuals that are a tad annoying. However, they are manageable in how few they are, and how good the other elements are. As always, Marvel still likes to dive a bit too much into jokes, the rapid banter becoming a flood that sometimes gets a tad stale for viewers like me. Still, this is less of an issue compared to a few other elements this movie suffers from. I like a good action movie, especially with an exciting battle that is climactic not only in emotion, but the actual splendor of the fight. Thunderbolts* is getting closer, but the ending felt more like a well-done drama with heart that lacks the tough-as-nails action shell the gooey center needs. Again, it's not as lackluster and dull as some other MCU endings, but it still could have been so much more with all the potential they were building. In terms of the biggest weakness, it's the character usage. Again, better than I thought, but Thunderbolts* still doesn't have the character balance down like Guardians or even the first Avengers movie. Many have decent screentime, but their utilization is mixed and often limited when some of that action element is removed. One in particular is a waste, practically unnecessary in the movie, except for a great set of moves. I want them to get the full use better, but this is moving towards something better. To summarize all of this, MCU is still a bit scattered like the multiverse and still needs some time to pull things back to the same level of magic that MCU used to be.The VERDICT:\nThunderbolts* does a lot in a short period, but for the most part, it worked very well for me. It's a fun adventure that dives into some character arcs, hits emotional ballads, but has a lot of joy doing it with the comedic fortitude that we've gotten in a lot of the MCU films. Fantastic production value (mostly) helps turn the comic world back to life, which is almost as strong as the acting of the cast and what they bring to the film. The storytelling is decent, and a lot of loose ends continue to be mopped up for the next shift of the connected films. It's overall very fun and a good popcorn munching film that I think will be better received than some of the other installments. True, it's still doing too much, and the theatrics are starting to get stale for a lot of things when they pump out as much as they do. Their character balance is still not back to par, and their action balance is still struggling to hit the same levels of wow factor that Marvel used to capitalize on. Outside of a few other minor things, though, Thunderbolts shows promise of returning to traditional Marvel with some new areas that will hopefully get back to the magic at hand. It is worth a trip to the theater for a viewing, in my opinion, potentially with 3-D to maximize the visuals.My scores are:\nAction/Adventure/Superhero/Drama/Crime/Comedy/Sci-Fi/Fantasy: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.5."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is one of the best Marvel movies in years, which is definitely shocking. When the first trailer for this released, I had quite low expectations. The trailer didn't really interest me, but then when the early reactions for the movie started roaming the internet, I heard amazing things about the movie, which is the exact opposite of what I expected. After hearing all of the positive reactions, I did start getting a little more excited for this movie, but I still didn't think it was going to be one of the best Marvel movies ever. But after seeing it, I actually think this might be one of the best. I don't think it quite makes it to the top 5, but it's definitely for sure somewhere in my top 10. This movie feels like old-school MCU. This is the first time I ever watched a Marvel movie being in awe over a post-credit scene since the Infinity Saga. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but if Fantastic Four ends up being good as well, then Marvel might just be back. I came into this movie being excited to see Bucky again, but my favorite character of the movie was easily Yelena. She's very well written, and she has a couple of pretty emotional scenes. Bob was great too, and his actor did an amazing job. I didn't really care too much about John in the past, but he was amazing in this movie, and the same thing goes for Ghost. Red Guardian was pretty good and is definitely a hilarious character. Then for Taskmaster, well, if you know, you know. Overall, I'd say Thunderbolts* is the second-best Marvel movie post-Endgame, only right behind Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. I'm very excited to see Fantastic Four. As I said, if it ends up being good as well, then Marvel might just be back!"

Surprisingly it was so good, exceeded all my expectations. Very good story, with great characters and no nostalgia bait People were laughing, shouting, and enjoying, there were full crazy vibes in the theater and we got our new black widow officially Florence Pugh damnn, this girl is amazing. I got satisfaction after watching her on the big screen is insane. The whole chemistry of Thunderbolts was very lovely, I didn't think it would be so much fun. Marvel cooked with this one something amazing! The whole film is exceptionally really entertaining the action is far better than what we saw in \"Brave New World And what stands out is how well it balances humor with serious moments that reminded me of our old OG GODLY MARVEL FILMS. The storyline is simple but with deep emotional layers, it sets the stage for the introduction of Sentry and the formation of the New Avengers. Sentry has an incredible screen presence and has the potential to be the next big thing. Big mighty MCU superhero.The post-credit was insane people were shouting ofc me too and it's very important for future Marvel films.What surprised me most was how well and emotionally the film's central themes were portrayed, such as exploring the theme of loneliness, especially as it relates to mental health and the struggle to find purpose and connection. Characters like Yelena and Bob struggle with the challenges of deep loneliness and overcoming past traumas, ultimately finding solace and strength in teamwork and mutual support. All these things which were shown Greatly and i felt all the things deeply."

It was grounded and gritty.Yelana and Hopper (from Stranger Hings) where my favs of the movie. I loved there banter and some of Hopper's lines made me and the entire cinema laugh. The villian is also uniqie with their powers. I feel like if this movie was not owned by disney, then they could have made that villian use his powers in such a dark way. I mean, their powers were already dark, but what if it went into an even darker direction.Oh well. I like how even thoug it has been many many years siunce we last all saw these characters, the movie does quick recaps of who they are, as I feel like these disney plus shows are starting to alienate the average watcher. Too many shows which many think are bad. This movie and the amrvels fet it right with you not needing to watch the tv shows.The shows actually feel more like filler at this point, expect for walker. You probarly need to watch falcon and the winter soilder. I won't lie, near the end, my mind was wondering but that was it. I also found the ending toi be confusing at fuirst, but the more I thought about the actions of 1 \"particualr character\" throughout the movie, the more it made sense. I liked it alot. And this movie feels like the beggining of a new era for marvel with the way it ended. Go see this movie."

The character development for the entire cast of characters was very poignant and relatable in quite a few scenes, especially the relationship between Alexi and Yelena. There was no need to have any kind of knowledge of the previous productions, it stood very well on its own merits. The humor and comedy were nowhere near as bad as some recent films like Thor: Love and Thunder and hit more often than missed. They weren't going for big belly laughs and it worked. (I actually walked out of that Thor film. That was the only time I have done that watching a Marvel film.)Well done and worth the watch."

It's no wonder no one wanted to come back. The Avengers are really dead imo. No movement forward just a stale 2 hour plus link to the next movie. What hell happened to the writers and producers. Any person with a cursory understanding of the MCU could have better... seriously I bet AI could got a better movie. If you want to see it don't expect much. Enjoy your concessions and pray Stan Lee can somehow haunt these so-called studio executives and creators into making a better universe because as I see it...it died and is in a coma."

Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, a sardonic yet broken Black Widow, commands the screen, while Lewis Pullman's tortured Bob/Sentry delivers a gut-punch performance that dives fearlessly into mental health struggles. The ensemble-Bucky, Red Guardian, John Walker, and more-forms a volatile, compelling found family, their chemistry fueling sharp banter and heartfelt redemption arcs. Director Jake Schreier's grounded approach, with visceral stunts and a standalone story, feels like a love letter to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Yet, the film stumbles with a cluttered plot that juggles too many threads, leaving characters like Ghost and Taskmaster underdeveloped. Action sequences, while intense, lack visual flair, and the drab cinematography mutes the energy. Marvel's formulaic shadow looms, with predictable beats that don't always match the film's bold ambitions. Still, Thunderbolts lands a powerful emotional blow, its raw heart and misfit spirit making it a standout in Phase 5."

This is a movie that soundly stands on its own, with stellar writing and performances that help each character stand out from the other.

          "content": "*minor spoilers*In Thunderbolts, Marvel tries a more emotional tack not seen since GOTG3. The misfits here are not just all former/current \"bad guys,\" but deeply unhappy ones to boot. Chief among them is Yelena, who thought continuing in her work as an assassin for hire would help her move past her sister's death, only to discover grief and unaddressed trauma have left her more empty than ever before. Ghost/Ava and US Agent/John are in similar straights, although the later is not self-aware enough to recognize it and remains the group's official a**hole. Even Bucky Barnes, who plays a relatively minor role in the film as the catalyst for pulling the team together, is clearly not finding being a Congressman nearly as fulfilling as he had hoped. Only Alexi/Red Guardian, although still a big goofball (and delightfully played by David Harbour: the actor is obviously having a blast) understands that what they all lack is meaning and connection. A tentative (and awkward, and often quite funny) team up ensues to battle the latest threat to humanity.Said threat, and really the centerpiece of the film, is the mysterious Bob, who is being manipulated by the ever-coniving Allegra de Fontaine, although exactly why remains a mystery for much of the film. Lewis Pullman, (who looks distractingly like his dad) does a solid job pulling off (without sharing any major spoilers) what had to have been an extremely difficult acting lift. The big bad has some genuinely scary moments (unfortunately already spoiled a bit in the ads): we haven't seen anything quite like him before in Marvel. (I look forward to presumably seeing more of him in the forthcoming Avengers: Doomsday.)Florence Pugh clearly \"gets\" Yelena and does a great job in the part: it's very \"Black Widow, Part Deux\". Julia Louis-Dryfus continues to chew the scenery, but it kinda works. Geraldine Viswanathan, who plays Allegra's put-upon assistant, seems to struggle a bit with the film's rapid cycling from snark to pathos and back again, which I blame more on the writing than the actress, who has been great in other roles. (For example, was she flirting with Bucky? Just asking for his help? Both? Neither? I really couldn't tell. Sadly, her character is clearly there just to move the plot forward.) Really wish Sebastian Stan had more screen time, as Bucky remains a fascinating character and is, frankly, far and away the most interesting of the team. Obviously Stan has bigger metaphorical fish to fry at this point is his career, but he, too, will hopefully have more to do in Doomsday. (I am going on record now saying that if Marvel kills off Bucky, I will personally lead the riot.)Although there is plenty of punching and wisecracking, and some genuinely excellent practical stunts (hurrah!), the focus on trauma, grief, addiction, and depression may not be for everyone.The ending as well as the end credits sequence intentionally raise more questions than they answer, which personally I found a bit annoying. (I know Marvel must always world build, but it more and more feels gratuitous and tacked-on. However, the audience around me went wild at those reveals, so ymmv.)Not a slam dunk, but a solid film that does more than just set up the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (looking at you, CA: BNW.) Looking forward to a re-watch!"

It felt darker, more grounded, and had a strong emotional core. Each character had their own struggles, and it wasn't just about action-it was about them trying to redeem themselves, even if they're still kind of messed up.Yelena was the standout for me. Florence Pugh nailed it-funny, tough, and vulnerable at the same time. Bucky also had some great moments, probably the best since The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. The team didn't feel like they were instantly best friends, and I liked that tension.The action was solid-gritty and intense without going overboard on CGI. The second act dragged a little, and a couple of characters could've had more screen time, but overall, it really worked for me.This felt like Marvel trying something different-and it paid off. Would definitely recommend it if you want something a bit more serious and character-driven."

Lewis Pullman gave a fantastic performance as an ex-drug addict who's deeply depressed, shy, yet still holds onto a hint of optimism. The Void was one of the movie's standout elements, and the post-credits scene completely blew my mind. The reveal of the Fantastic Four's extra-dimensional ship entering our universe was so unexpected-the entire cinema erupted when the logo appeared on the side.The only issue I really had was that the looming threat was defeated by the power of friendship."

          "content": "The first thing the film does well is that we don't need to know anyone on the team that much. Maybe know Bucky's face from previous films, and watch Black Widow to learn about Yelena's history. The film can summarize the origins and problems of all the main characters. The weakness, the feeling of being drifted, and the loneliness make us feel connected to their humanity..\nBy looking at the poster, it seems like Yelena will be the heart of the film and the story, which is somewhat true because we are with her almost the entire time. Not to mention Florence Pugh's performance, especially that scene on the street. But the film also gives good light to the supporting cast as well. John Walker... no, Wyatt Russell got his redemption arc, and Bob is a counterbalance as the other side of the coin for this film. I like that this team has to reluctantly go all out. They do everything they can until they discover that they are all the same. It turns out that they complement each other. A little pity is Ghost. Of course, her character would be liked more than before, but I thought of an arc that would make her character stand out more on the way home. As for Taskmaster, she is the shadow carrier; it will blow your mind why we didn't see her that much in the trailer..\nEven though I have only watched the first 2 trailers. The story has almost no surprises for me, thanks to the good pacing, clear tone, good chemistry, and the A24 crew who hop in and make this film. Even though it has a Marvel brand on it, it still feels different. The hand-to-hand action scenes are raw but not as heavy. The same goes for the visuals that are not bland clean clean-looking. But the music is a little disappointing because Son Lux didn't bring the same energy as in EEAAO with them to this..\nI may not be able to say that I love it the most after Endgame, like many people say. Because the technical problems in the theater held back my emotions a bit, but I fully agree that it's a film that Marvel has tried to make many times in the past few years. It's fun, down-to-earth, and has heart, including the passing of the baton that made me quite hyped."

Centered around a team of morally conflicted anti-heroes, the film trades glossy idealism for raw emotion and complex character arcs. Florence Pugh is magnetic as Yelena Belova, leading a powerhouse ensemble that includes Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, and David Harbour-each delivering nuanced performances that balance pain, purpose, and dark humor.Director Jake Schreier crafts a story that blends intense action with emotional weight, exploring themes of redemption, trauma, and the gray areas between heroism and villainy. The chemistry between the cast crackles with tension, and their uneasy alliance keeps the stakes high and unpredictable. Visually stylish and narratively daring, Thunderbolts steps outside Marvel's comfort zone and succeeds with confidence.This is not just another team-up film-it's a character-driven, high-stakes thrill ride that challenges what it means to be a hero. Thunderbolts is gritty, gripping, and one of the MCU's most memorable chapters to date."

          "content": "With The MCU now into its 17th year we are getting new projects and new ideas and the newest of those is Thunderbolts* I saw the film today and here is my review. The premise of the film sees a group of dangerous operatives brought together in order to survive and potentially make themselves better.Main Character\nFlorence Pugh as Yelena Belova has become a much loved character in supporting roles but here she is given the real spotlight and is easily the main character here. She is given lots of the character development and the themes of the film really go through her. Pugh is fantastic and really deserved this opportunity and Yelena is a great lead character.Supporting Characters\nSebastian Stan as Bucky is the most experienced MCU actor here and he does a good job. It takes a while for him to actually get involved with the group but he becomes the driving force for the group and it was cool seeing Bucky in this leadership role.David Harbour is back as Red Guardian and he was a true joy here. He is clearly the comic relief character but he really embraces it and has so much fun. The relationship between Yelena and him is at the forefront of the film and Harbour adds plenty to that.Wyatt Russell reprises his role as John Walker and he was a fun addition here. He has great chemistry with the rest of the cast and I just enjoy him in this role. They kind of try to make you care about him but it doesn't really work and he is mostly just an entertaining loudmouth.Lewis Pullman plays Bob and he is also great. The trailers pretty much spoiled his role in the film but the film does a mostly good job in making you care about him and the struggles that he goes through and Pullman does his best with the material.Hannah John-Kamen plays Ghost again after her somewhat forgettable appearance in Ant-Man and The Wasp and although she does a good job, Ghost really gets put into the background as the film progresses and once again she just isn't given enough to do.Story\nThe story does a good job of bringing these dangerous and unlikeable people together and getting them to work together to bring the best out of each other. It really handles Yelena's character well and the theme of redemption being important for these characters. However, this film makes some weak creative decisions and the scenes between Val and Mel felt pointless and really drove down the overall feel of the film. Its ending also feels a bit rushed and I felt like there was more that they could have done with it.Script\nThe script is good. I laughed quite a bit throughout the film which means it is a return to form for MCU writers. I also believed in the emotional scenes and the development that the characters are going through. For a big superhero film it does an effective job at a character study and the emotional side of these people.Style\nThe film looks great, there are some great action scenes and they take advantage of having all these dangerous people who have different abilities to best effect. The film is also paced well and it kind of flew by but in a good way as I was never bored.Overall\nOverall, Thunderbolts* is a real return to form for The Marvel Cinematic Universe. I really enjoyed this collection of characters and I think some of the more mature tones really worked and I would definitely recommend a watch.Rating - 9/10."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is a movie I've been looking forward to finally seeing for more than two years now and after finally seeing it, I can say that the MCU is on the brink of being so back. When antihero's Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier, Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian, John Walker/U. S. Agent, Ava Starr/Ghost, and Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster are brought together due to recent events put into place by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, it's up to the newly formed Thunderbolts* to confront their pasts and stop Valentina's dangerous program known as S. E. N. T. R. Y. For starters, Florence Pugh as the leader of the Thunderbolts* and title character Yelena Belova gives us the best version we've seen of this character so far and is definitely the heart and soul of the entire movie. Sebastian Stan returning as Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier was also great to see again and is a great addition to the Thunderbolts*. David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov/Red Guardian was also another great addition to the team and definitely has some of the funniest moments of the film. Wyatt Russell returning as John Walker/U. S. Agent also gives us some of the best character development we've seen from his character yet. Hannah John-Karmen as Ava Starr/Ghost was probably the character I was most glad to see again after a long absence since Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018). Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster was fine to see again, but short lived. Julia Louis Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine gives us the best version of her character we've seen yet and I was glad that we got more of a backstory for her character. Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel was also a great addition to the film. Finally, Lewis Pullman as Robert Reynolds/Sentry/The Void, also known as Bob is probably one of the most comic accurately written and standout characters we have ever gotten in the MCU so far and his performance as the character was incredible. If I have any negatives with the movie, it's that I wish we had gotten to spend more time with certain characters such as Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier and I wished we gotten to see more of the Sentry side of Robert Reynolds than what was given, even though what was given was absolutely spectacular. I also wished we had gotten more insight on where Ava Starr/Ghost has been since the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) and I feel like the pacing towards the beginning of the film was a little uneven, but once the actual story gets going, it becomes everything it needs to be. Overall, Thunderbolts* is one of the best movies to come from Phase 5 of the MCU that tackles themes mental health, depression, substance and alcohol abuse, while also showing us that not every battle has to be fought alone, and that it can be fought together, with the film also giving us some really great action sequences, great writing and mostly great character development, while also preparing us for the exciting future that lies ahead for the MCU. Rating 9/10."

This is the studio's most emotionally grounded story in years, anchored by Florence Pugh, who wears the movie's pain like armor and carries its emotional weight like a soldier with no war left to fight. Lewis Pullman gives the MCU something it's been missing: restraint, complexity, and a quiet storm of guilt and hope.There's a rawness here, not in spectacle, but in spirit. These aren't heroes with clean arcs or world-saving monologues. They're wreckage, trying to assemble meaning from regret. David Harbour adds levity without undercutting the tone, Sebastian Stan sneaks in one hell of a moment, and the team chemistry crackles with baggage and reluctant camaraderie.The action is practical, punchy, and blessedly light on sky lasers. And the script? Surprisingly therapeutic. It's about learning to live with yourself even when the world tells you you're not worth the redemption.Thunderbolts is Marvel in group therapy - flawed, fractured, and finally honest. It doesn't just earn your cheers; it earns your empathy. And honestly? We needed that."

          "content": "Thunderbolt is not your typical superhero movie. At first glance, it may seem like just another entry in the Marvel universe, but beneath its surface lies a powerful reflection on exclusion, vulnerability, and the human need for belonging.The film's title refers to a neighborhood soccer team where Helena - one of the protagonists - once played as goalkeeper. She chose that role not for physical prowess, but because she wanted to be \"the one the team could rely on if everything went wrong.\" This symbolic choice echoes throughout the film: trust, loyalty, and the ability to hold others through crisis become the true superpowers.One of the most complex characters is Valentina de Fountain, the CIA director who faces congressional accusations for developing weapons through human experimentation in secret labs outside the U. S. Her assistant, Mel, is organized and fiercely loyal, but emotionally worn down by Valentina's abusive leadership. Still, Mel coordinates a secret operation to destroy all evidence that could bring Valentina down. The moral ambiguity in these characters makes it clear: there are no pure heroes or villains here - only people trapped in ethically murky systems.The plot shifts dramatically when three low-profile former superheroes are summoned for a covert mission, which turns out to be a trap designed to make them eliminate each other. Realizing this, they choose to work together - and unexpectedly encounter a character named Bob.Bob is introduced as fragile, clumsy, and seemingly harmless, dressed in pajamas. Yet his power is deeply unsettling: when he touches someone, he triggers their darkest memories, plunging them into a mental void where they relive their worst nightmares in a never-ending cycle.Elena, recognizing both her fear and Bob's pain, makes a brave choice to enter the void voluntarily. There, she searches for Bob's most vulnerable side, realizing his power is, in fact, a desperate act of self-protection born from deep trauma.The film offers a nuanced take on antisocial behavior, presenting it not as inherent evil but as the outcome of circumstances beyond the characters' control. It also humanizes Russian characters - especially a father-daughter relationship - associating them with tenderness, familial bonds, and a youthful longing for recognition.Ultimately, Thunderbolts is a moving story about finding solidarity among strangers. It invites viewers to see others - even those who seem dangerous or distant - as sentient beings capable of pain, love, and redemption. A compelling reminder that every soul has value, and that compassion is often the most radical form of power."

There's a reason why it was one of my Top 10 Most Anticipated for 2025, and it paid off. I really liked the idea of an MCU version of the Suicide Squad from DC, and despite a lot of rewrites and reshoots, they managed to make the best Marvel movie in awhile. This feels like the most emotionally mature, grounded MCU film since Captain America: Civil War. Characters are broken inside, and instead of throwing out a joke, the story demands growth and development from each of them. They all come from dark backgrounds, and have even been fully-fledged villains at one point. And yet when faced not only by the darkness from The Void, but the darkness within each of them, they must learn to move on from it and lean on those around them when necessary.There's an immediate camaraderie between the different characters, linked not just by circumstance but lived experiences. Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova is clearly not just the star, but the warm, beating heart of the movie. Her struggles feel very real and justified, and as she searches for meaning, she pulls the audience in with her open vulnerability. Supported by a solid returning cast of David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov/The Red Guardian, Wyatt Russell as John Walker/U. S. Agent, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr/Ghost, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier, Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as CIA Director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Making their MCU debut are Lewis Pullman as Robert 'Bob' Reynolds/Sentry/The Void and Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel (possibly Mockingbird?).One last thing of note was the color palette and cinematography. There were a lot of practical effects, which made the world feel more lived in and real, and to the surprise of no one the CGI is once again really rough in spots. Normally, I prefer films with a brighter color palette, but for the emotional feel the filmmakers were trying to achieve, the darker, more gray color palette worked perfectly. It further emphasized the darker, serious emotions the characters were dealing with through the story. The cinematography is also really pristine to look at, with some of the shots being truly beautiful.Overall, this is one of Marvel's best since Avengers: Endgame, and is an entry into the franchise that MCU fans should definitely go out and support in theaters.Full Review to follow."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* - solid 7.5.Good action/fight scenes. Good story line, but left wanting more...\nI Loved Yelena, her character was perfect, most of my favorite lines were hers. I think Red Guardian was a solid second. His character provided both comic relief and background of where Yelena got her heart. Bob played all his parts really well and made me think of where is character will go. The rest all played their parts well, would have like more of the Taskmaster and Ghost. The only downside is I can see is if you hadn't seen all the previous character stories, you might not have the appropriate empathy for everyone on the team. Overall very enjoyable but felt something was missing. Bottom line, just watch it at least twice!"

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts' comes thru just in the nick of time, when Marvel Cinema desperately needed a legitimate reset back to the 'good old Days' encapsulating the essential quality admixture of Charismatic-characters, solid-Story structure, injected with high-dosage of Humor.The success of this entry really hinges on the fantastic multilayered performances particularly from Florence Pugh (Yelena) and David Harbour (Red Guardian) whose interactions are both electrifying and quite humorous, but also imbued with authentic emotional-resonance, un-locking an abundance of genuine 'heart & Soul.'The focus on quirky character interactions and at times awkward (but endearing) Team 'bonding' is the glue that keeps audiences captivated and entertained throughout this film.The surprise is how well the character of 'Bob/Sentry/Void' is actuated on film (with terrifying + poignant performance by Lewis Pullman). The stark contrast of being Superhuman and nearly god-like but also remaining emotionally fragile/tormented/ uncertain, and searching but rarely finding much needed compassion, adds dramatic dimensions rarely seen in 'Superhero' movies.My prior favorite Marvel films were the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' trilogy plus Captain America 'Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War' entries. 'Thunderbolts' seems to merge a lot of what made those earlier films Great = melding charismatic (sometimes quirky) characters with hyper-kinetic action while maintaining authentic emotional-resonance that audiences can really relate to.The added surprise is that the final Post-credits scene is actually meaningful/relevant for a change and even provides legitimate anticipation for the next Marvel summer release, hope the positive momentum continues."

It's fun, packed with solid action, a good pace, and humor that lands just right without going overboard.The cast does a great job: Florence Pugh continues to shine as Yelena - charismatic and full of presence. Sebastian Stan gives us a more reserved Winter Soldier with strong moments. David Harbour as Red Guardian is funny without being too much, and Wyatt Russell brings interesting layers to U. S. Agent. Hannah John-Kamen has good moments as Ghost, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus remains sharp and manipulative as Valentina.The script is tight and to the point. Nothing groundbreaking, but everything fits well, with solid character interactions and no major plot holes.After some recent ups and downs, Thunderbolts* is a movie that genuinely entertained me. Definitely worth watching."

The director for this movie deserves a huge amount of credit as well as respect for portraying all of these characters in the film in such unique and artistic ways. Marvel hasn't been at great quality in terms of their production really (movies and tv shows) but this was amazing. It wasn't too long or too short it was a perfect time. The soundtrack was outstanding fitting the theme of every scene and action sequence. This movie crazily has a lot of references about mental health issues in society stating that its fine to call out for help. The movie can be dark in some aspects, violent as well as funny. It fitted and met all the criteria for me, definitely worth it!"

Highlighting anti-heroes more, planting the seeds for the New Avengers, and setting the stage for the upcoming Doomsday film was a very welcome move. With this project, Marvel has finally started to build up hype again, just like they did before Endgame. The after-credit scene connecting it to the Fantastic Four was also a very satisfying surprise.As for the film itself-I really didn't like how Taskmaster exited the movie so early. I would have preferred for the character to stay longer. On the other hand, I'm glad they're setting up Yelena as the new Black Widow. Her backstory and the motivation that follows were well executed.John Walker's new version felt much better to me after his failed stint as Captain America. Ghost was more in control and focused compared to how she was in Ant-Man, and this stability will be a big asset to the New Avengers team heading into Doomsday.Bucky was mature and composed in this film, adding a strong emotional layer. Red Guardian, while a bit dull at first due to his emotional swings, ultimately won me over with his motivation through Yelena and his desire to be part of the team."

These emotional layers give the film authenticity, grounding its spectacle in something real and affecting.Florence Pugh is unforgettable as Yelena.

Thunderbolts* blew me away with its creative writing, comedic sequences, and action. The characters are so well written, even though they are anti-heroes, you can't help but root for them. Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman stole the show. The ending is something you wouldn't expect from a Marvel movie, as it is so much like an A24 film, with, of course, much of the team belonging to that studio.The most amazing thing is they finally got the pacing right after so many years, and the film lets you breathe. The ending is very emotional and intense, and the whole cinema was in awe and silence. The credits, Mid-Credit, and Post-Credit are as funny as they are mind-blowing, as they put the future of Marvel so close to you.All in all, Loved the film, will watch it again in the cinema, and need Marvel to keep doing what they did here!PROS:Amazing and Creative action.VFX & SFX as always top notch.Deep character arcs and writing.Good old Marvel feels like the whole film.Actually Important post-credit scene.CONS:Some quick shifts from high to lows & vice versa, which imbalances the movie."

          "content": "It has been 13 films and six years since Avengers: Endgame (2019) capped off an unlikely decade of interwoven blockbusters that defined a cinematic era. In the years since, Disney has often appeared adrift-lacking clear direction or consistent quality. A slew of mostly forgettable Disney+ shows only diluted the goodwill the brand had painstakingly built. Since Bob Iger's return as CEO, the studio has imposed cutbacks, signaling a phase of damage control. Earlier this year, Captain America: Brave New World (2025) sacrificed quality in an attempt to start connecting the disparate threads of the past few years. Now comes Thunderbolts* (2025), aiming to further right the ship.Thunderbolts* functions as a spiritual sequel to Black Widow (2021) while also gathering loose ends from several sidelined MCU characters. CIA Director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is under investigation for her unauthorized use of enhanced individuals-including Secret Agent (Wyatt Russell), Yelena (Florence Pugh), and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen)-in covert operations. In an effort to erase the evidence, she attempts to eliminate her former operatives, only to spark a rebellion. The group, now joined by reformed Winter Soldier and current Congressman Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the bombastic Red Guardian (David Harbour), and the mysterious lab experiment Bob (Lewis Pullman), turn against her.Directed by Jake Schreier-best known for Paper Towns (2015) and the acclaimed miniseries Beef (2023)-Thunderbolts* stands out in the MCU for its focus on character over spectacle. Schreier, working with a small writing team (Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo), simplifies the typical Marvel formula. The result is a film that forgoes a barrage of action set-pieces in favor of character development, introspective banter, and emotional depth. While de Fontaine plays the familiar government villain, a surprising secondary antagonist (unnamed here to avoid spoilers) shifts the narrative toward themes of isolation and mental health. By spending time with its characters and exploring their feelings of rejection and regret, Thunderbolts* builds to an emotionally resonant finale that feels earned. Yes, there's still the standard punching and explosions, but beneath it lies a refreshing psychological lesson in solidarity and compassion-one that avoids sentimentality and instead feels genuinely moving.That said, Thunderbolts* is still a derivative film, borrowing liberally from Suicide Squad (2016) and relying heavily on prior knowledge from Black Widow and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021). At this stage in the MCU, it's nearly impossible to craft a truly standalone story, but Schreier comes impressively close. Within the constraints of the studio machine, he manages to create a distinct and surprisingly self-contained experience.For an ensemble film, Thunderbolts* balances its screen time well among its leads, though Pugh's Yelena emerges as the clear centerpiece-and deservedly so. Pugh remains magnetic, elevating a fairly standard backstory through sheer force of performance. Russell and John-Kamen also benefit from more screen time, but it's Pullman's Bob who unexpectedly steals the show. Bringing nuance, vulnerability, and mystery to a role that could've been flat, Pullman cements his rising-star status and anchors the film's emotional arc alongside Pugh. Meanwhile, Harbour, Stan, and Dreyfus are unfortunately shortchanged-falling into stock roles of comic relief, stoic warrior, and cartoonish villain, respectively-moments that occasionally undercut the film's more grounded emotional beats.Still, Thunderbolts* offers the jolt of energy the MCU sorely needed. With a tighter story and renewed focus on character, it dodges many of the franchise's recent missteps. While it's not free of Marvel's usual formulaic trappings, it's a promising reminder that there are still stories worth telling-and ways to tell them with heart-inside the ever-expanding Marvel machine."

          "content": "Is this the team that can carry the Avengers' torch? Has Marvel finally found its stride again? Some have hailed \"Thunderbolts\" as a refreshing entry in the franchise, with critics giving it an 88% score on Rotten Tomatoes (audiences haven't weighed in yet, and IMDb doesn't have a score as of this writing). Personally, I'd give it a generous 6 out of 10-and wouldn't argue if someone rated it lower. Still, it's a step up from some of Marvel's recent efforts.On the bright side, \"Thunderbolts\" attempts to explore deeper themes like loneliness, identity, and personal growth. While it doesn't always hit the mark, there's something admirable about Marvel's effort to take risks and break out of their usual formula. It's a movie that's trying to be more introspective, even if it stumbles along the way.Here's why \"Thunderbolts\" didn't quite blow me away-but also why there's still hope for Marvel:1. Second-Tier Heroes, Second-Tier Results:\nAside from a few standouts, the team feels like a group of underdogs. While the original Avengers were built up over a decade of storytelling, this lineup doesn't have the same foundation. The movie does little to shake the impression that they're a step below Marvel's A-list heroes.That said, there's a boldness in spotlighting lesser-known characters. It's almost like watching an underdog story unfold. They may not reach the heights of the original Avengers, but there's something endearing about their attempt to find their place in the Marvel universe.2. A Slower, Dialogue-Heavy Approach:\nAt two hours long, \"Thunderbolts\" feels more like a character study than a traditional superhero film. The action sequences are solid, but the pacing is slower, with a heavier emphasis on dialogue and personal struggles.Marvel clearly wants to add more emotional depth to their storytelling, which is commendable. However, the execution doesn't always stick the landing, and at times, the movie feels weighed down by its introspection.3. Exploring Loneliness and Belonging:\nThe film's central themes of isolation and self-discovery are a welcome departure from Marvel's usual formula. While not always executed perfectly, the attempt to humanize these characters and delve into their inner struggles is worth acknowledging.4. Predictable Plot and Marketing Issues:\nWithout getting into specifics, the story's structure is fairly predictable, and the trailers reveal more than they should. This predictability doesn't ruin the experience, but it does dampen the sense of discovery.5. Humor That Doesn't Always Land:\nThe humor in \"Thunderbolts\" is hit-or-miss. While some moments are genuinely funny, others fall flat. One character, in particular, tries to be a quirky, morally ambiguous leader but doesn't quite reach their full potential.6. A Mixed Bag of Characters:\nWhile some characters are given compelling arcs, others feel underdeveloped. Relationships that were strong in previous films don't always hit the same emotional highs here. That said, the movie does emphasize the importance of found family, which adds a heartfelt layer to the story.7. A Tease for What's Next:\nThe post-credits scene hints at what's to come for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it feels more like a setup than a payoff, it's enough to spark curiosity about future projects.Conclusion: A Step in a Different Direction\nIf you enjoyed \"Black Widow\" (2021), you might find \"Thunderbolts\" to be a solid, if uneven, follow-up. While it doesn't recapture the magic of Marvel's earlier hits, it takes risks by focusing on themes like loneliness, self-doubt, and personal growth.At best, \"Thunderbolts\" is a decent watch if you go in with low expectations. At worst, it's a reminder that Marvel's golden age may be behind us. Either way, it's a step in a different direction-and that's something Marvel fans should be cautiously optimistic about."

Now this isn't \"peak marvel\" for me, we're still a long shot from that. However I think Thunderbolts is a well paced and fun action movie with a surprisingly compelling theme of Mental Health.This movie wouldn't work if the characters weren't as good as they are, the main ones like Yelena and Walker are expanded upon very well from their previous appearances, also in an extremely clever manner through the character of Bob who I really was fully invested in every second he had off screen. The performances by the actors was one of my favorite things about this movie, although not every emotional moment hit for me, I'm very glad we're still in a time where actors are not phoning it in for the mcu. Everyone here stills showcases their charisma and love for the roles they are playing, my only negatives would be some wonky CGI moments with Sentry and probably how effortlessly the team finds Yelena and Bob in the void, they're minor thoughts but worth pointing out, I definitely see what most see in this movie, finally some good mcu."

I didn't think that it would work as well as it did. John Walker and Bob became my favorite duo in the film. SPOILER The sentry fight was actually nerve wracking be our heroes clearly stood no chance in defeating Sentry and I became scared wondering if another character would bite the dust. The Void was terrifying and really was an Avengers level threat. Lewis did a great job balancing all three characters. Florence as usual does a great job but my biggest surprise was how much I actually liked Ghost. Remember finding her annoying in Ant Man and the Wasp. Sebastian gives a good performance balancing his newly found position in the government and his current predicament. All of the characters were really good in the film.SPOILERS BELOWThe Bad: My biggest complaint is the lack of continuity in the aftermath of the Void fight. From what we see is that all the victims of the void end up in deep pocket of their mind or some small pocket universe fueled by the Voids powers. But once the Void is \"defeated\" everyone seemed to have bit been phased by it whatsoever leading into the New Avengers press conference. How could have Val set that up with all the chaos and everyone being in the shadow realm and how the press was ready for the New Avengers and not be having a mental breakdown. There's gotta be some way to address that. Another thing I didn't really like is the short fight sequences with Sentry and barely a fight with the Void. There was no true big finale fight we all grew to love. Although I did really enjoy the smaller scale and intimate climax that occurred.Would've been an 8 or 9 if trailers and doomsday news didn't ruin it."

People promised a funny yet intelligent plot about mental disorder.Well, guess what? It was exactly the same old drag as usual.Violent, dark and boring. I literally groaned when I saw the scene with the little girl standing on the street, about to be hit by a boulder and, what do you know, a superhero saved her in the last millisecond (funny enough, none of the superhero checked, if there were people on the other side of the boulder when they flipped it). REALLY?? I remember having seen that scene in about a thousand other superhero movies.I am just mad at myself for falling into the Disney money-grabbing machine!

          "content": "Marvel's new film debuted in theaters with low expectations and no box office rivals.When I say low expectations, I'm talking about the general public and all the people who have abandoned the MCU ship in recent years, and not without reason. After all, the vast majority of projects haven't been entirely convincing, especially on the television front.The box office failure and critical acclaim of the last Captain America film didn't help the hype either.However, we have a film that shines brightly. It's been a long time since we've had a Marvel film that didn't need others and their connections to be popular.There's a breath of fresh air, and the MCU has the opportunity to capitalize on it.The premise is a simple film; the execution stands out quite a bit above average.While it greatly develops the characters of Yelena and Bob, and not so much others like Ghost or Bucky, we have a strong plot and a transition during the first two acts that keep us on edge and entertained.A particular fear I had was the inclusion of Red Guardian and his humor, which had already failed me in previous projects. However, here he contributes, and that's appreciated.The third act is very risky. We were coming off the Captain America movie, where, thanks to the power of the script, he was able to face Red Hulk. Here, at first glance, it seems that the power of friendship is what resolves the plot, but this is more than that... for me, everyone's embrace of Bob is the catharsis of acceptance. That's why I loved the third act so much, and I didn't miss the blows or epic battles. Anyone who has suffered from deep depression knows that no matter how hard you fight and try day after day against that emptiness that drags you down, often only those around you know that you are more than the shadow you appear to be. Accepting your condition, accepting that trying to overcome it has never worked, but rather, on the contrary, eats away at you and separates you from society even more. When you're like this, you realize that embracing it and seeking help to reach that embrace is the only thing that can save you. That depression is a part of you, and instead of trying to beat it down, the best thing is to accept it and learn to live with it.Maybe I'm overanalyzing this last part, but it really seems much deeper to me than thinking that the script could have resolved everything.Even at the end, we have time for the writers to show us an effective way to limit a character's power, and not with the classic \"I was on another planet when all this happened,\" as they did perfectly with Sentry, \"If I unleash my power, I'll also unleash that monster.\" Simply brilliant.At the end, there are two post-credits scenes, one of which has a direct connection to \"Fantastic 4\" and which opens the debate to many questions about what we'll see in July.I sincerely appreciate what Marvel did with \"Thunderbolts*,\" now I wait for what's next."

Again the lead character gives a speech to the villain so they stop what they're doing. But the movie doesn't show you enough about the villain to empathize with him, you barely know his name and how he got his powers.There's a lot of characters that are waisted, adding to the general lack of character development.The ending is completely anticlimactic and the whole point of the movie just vanishes.I'd recommend you to save your money or spend it watching something else."

          "content": "It's mostly a bad movie, but not as bad as I expected. The genre is drama with superhero action.The first half is bad in many ways, but then it catches up in the second half. So bring your fidget spinner and do an exercise in being patient.COHERENCE.The movie feels like a passable group project - understandable with hundreds of people working on the same (secret) project. This is a problem in movies like The Suicide Squad, Thor: Love and Thunder, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice etc. Not even the most talented editor can save the mess of a group project. But Thunderbolts* has a theme that ties it all together - mental health. Therefore the movie feels more coherent. The theme is fleeing however, since the movie is so bland that you forget the emotions before walking out of the theatre.The fast pacing makes it impossible to dwell into sadness. There are too many scenes trying to tell the same story. Please, just choose one story and let me feel it! But no, we gotta move on to the next subplot, and yet the movie is 2+ hours long. What a waste of time. Anyway...\nApparently the movie was affected by the writers' strike, so that may explain some of the problems with the screenplay. But I would probably hire better writers either way.Let's compare with another Kevin Feige movie: Deadpool & Wolverine. I consider that a comedy, but the Wolverine story moved me to tears way more than Thunderbolts* ever did with its multiple parallel personal storylines. I don't wish to offend the Marvel fans, but I was not sure if a flashback was showing Yelena, Ava, Valentina or Antonia. Emotions become bland when you scatter them across so many subplots. My interest dilutes every time we move on to the next character. I was told the movie would be a therapy session, but we only touch the surface and never dig deep into our emotions.DEPRESSION.The movie deals with depression. I've had depression, but I didn't relate to the story. I think depression is different for everyone, so go see for yourself. As I said, it's mostly superficial even though there's 2 hours of \"therapy\".PRODUCTION.-Music: basic.-Colors: bland. Like the Snyder movies, the colors are as bland as possible - almost noir. You could argue this is on topic with depression, but when you have no colorful scenes there is also no contrast between happy and sad. The result is a boring, bland mess. Depressing, you might say. But what a waste of CGI.-4DX: the 4DX experience gave life to the movie.-Budget: $180M. The high budget really boosts the movie with best-in-class CGI, action and scenery. This separates it from \"straight to DVD\" productions, and it's worth watching on the big screen. You can compare this with other high budget movies, like The Suicide Squad ($185M), Deadpool & Wolverine ($200M), Wonder Woman ($149M), Thor: Love and Thunder ($250M), Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($250-325M) etc. (not adjusted for inflation).CONS.Some smaller issues:.-Some scenes feel like a lecture. I don't go to the movies to be told how to speak, and I don't agree with you. But at least they keep it subtle and two degrees away from contemporary issues.-It's a political story, and as usual Hollywood prefers the one party and is mocking the other party.-God is discussed.-The main character is a girlboss who easily fights the bad guys. It's not an issue, since she has emotional character development.CONCLUSION.You can skip this one. I wouldn't watch it on TV. It was a good 4DX experience, but I could only choose between this and A Minecraft Movie.The quality is similar to Thor: Love and Thunder, but replacing comedy with therapy.2/10."

Without her, this movie would've fallen flat for their attempt.There's a lot of comic relief throughout the film, and while some of it is funny, it sometimes is just too much. Marvel tries to be serious and comedic at the same time, and it didn't always balance well.Now let's talk about Bob. He might be the most powerful character we've ever seen in the MCU, and they beat him with a hug. I mean I understand the message but if you're looking for a traditional marvel movie beating the villain with force, this isn't it.Marvel clearly wants this group to be the next Avengers, the \"reject squad\" feels about right. They're not bad, just not anywhere near as iconic or exciting as the original team.Overall, Thunderbolts has a few great moments, but it's messy and not as fun or epic as most Marvel fans are used to.

Props if you enjoy this, but I am literally the target audience (young adult male who likes comic books) and I didn't."

It brought in a strong ensemble full of comedic relief that brought family and friends together to enjoy. The characters were great and the story was a segue into new Marvel content that will get every fan excited. My favorite character was the introduction of Sentry a troubled person trying to come to grips with his powers. Personally I did not know if Thunderbolts would be good but I was humbled to my core when watching and am so excited for the next movie. If you are looking for another Marvel movie blockbuster than look no further because you will get what you are looking for. A little less action in this movie than previous Marvel films, but the comedy and complex topics of facing your demons is where the movie shines. This movie is the start to the next generation of Marvel and cannot wait for what is ahead."

She is her character, so much heart and emotion and she uses it so phenomenally to portray the loss and darkness Yelena has inside her that was not her fault. Brava! I was very happy to see the much needed fall of a not needed character, no spoilers here, they were way overhyped and way underutilized in an earlier movie, and quickly dispatched here in a very necessary minor course correction. It was a very slow and painful start after Endgame, (I still haven't seen Brave New World. The whole idea just didn't appeal to me and I was the biggest MCU fangirl of them all.) but I feel that with Thunderbolts*, Marvel may be back on an upswing. Here's to hoping, although I'm not that happy Kang had to be scrapped in favor of RDJ as Doom. I love Robert, but he did his time, all the main ones did, and we need the new blood to get us excited about what's coming now. Again, complete love and applause to Thunderbolts* for giving us a down to earth, back to basics movie with heart and practical effects and minimal useless hype and fluff. Go see it!"

The pre-release marketing, such as the hilarious Red Guardian limo hire service ad on YT, complete with a phone number to call, added an extra layer of fun and engagement for fans.The mystery behind the asterisk in Thunderbolts* was cleverly unveiled in the film's final moments, delivering a shocking yet exhilarating revelation that will particularly delight fans familiar with the comics.Even the post-credits scenes were expertly crafted, leaving me thrilled and eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

While the Thunderbolts group that's been put together has a fantastic dynamic and major potential in future projects, it's clear through the slow plot, hesitant pacing, inability to properly set up a conflict for the story and likely the most anti-climactic and abrupt resolution to a Marvel movie ever, the studio didn't care how the Thunderbolts were set up as long as they were just set up. Unfortunately, this movie is not the big package Marvel fans have been waiting for and will only serve as context for a bleak future of Marvel Superheroes."

The humor was spotty at best and the characters were alright.

And I thought much of the humor in this was way more natural and subdued than many of the other projects Marvel has done in recent years. The story was interesting and different for this franchise, and I really enjoyed the final \"battle\" in the third act. It was a nice change of pace from what we've grown to expect. And, for once, the ending of the movie, including the end credits scene, actually made me excited for what's to come in the franchise. 7/10."

But with Thunderbolts, I didn't feel the need to explain why I liked it. I just genuinely enjoyed it-no caveats, no disclaimers.The film made me fall in love with a group of characters that, on paper, shouldn't work. It's often described as the MCU's Suicide Squad, or a more grounded version of Guardians of the Galaxy. And I mean that in the best way possible. It takes a bunch of so-called rejects and misfits, and makes you truly care about them.More than that, Thunderbolts feels like one of the most character-driven stories in the entire MCU. It's not just another chapter in the larger saga, not just another CGI roller coaster or cameo parade. It feels like a real movie-with a clear vision and emotional core. It's about something.The story dives deep into themes like depression, loneliness, mental illness, lack of purpose, and regret-very raw, human experiences. And it doesn't tiptoe around these ideas; it confronts them head-on. These characters are broken, and they need each other to heal.Even in the third act, the film avoids the typical CGI army showdown. Instead, it ventures into a surrealist world-largely achieved with practical effects-that visually represents the movie's emotional and thematic undercurrents. That's a bold move for a Marvel film, and it works. It gives the story more weight and resonance.There's a refreshing balance of grounded action and imaginative storytelling. The surreal elements don't feel tacked on-they're purposeful, expressive, and earned. The MCU rarely attempts this kind of visual storytelling, and it was honestly invigorating to see.By the time the movie ended, I found myself saying, \"Now I see where we're going.\" That feeling-the sense of excitement, of narrative direction and emotional payoff-is something I hadn't felt in a Marvel movie in a long time. Thunderbolts brought that back."

Yes, you can bring up the Avengers crowd and Aunt May but for all the buildings collapsing, cars exploding, and huge rocks falling, there should be a much higher body count.

The story is a little convoluted, but essentially about the creation of a super being. It also, rather clumsily in my view, deals with depression - at least the film makers can be credited with tackling an \"issue\" and fair play to them for this.The script is fine, and has some humour, the Direction keeps things moving along, but there are pauses in the action - which might be a problem for some audience members ( I noticed restlessness in some audience members during these episodes).The acting/actors make a fist of their parts. Pugh carries the main part of the film, as a very floored hero, almost an anti hero. The rest of the cast add a decent circle of characterisation. A special mention for Lewis Pullman, who brings a level of other worldliness to his role.This is an entertaining film and, maybe, signifies an increase in or positive change in quality for the MCU."

Thunderbolts* is fast-paced, exhilarating, unpredictable, powerful and surprisingly philosophical in more ways than one. Dare I say the most relatable Marvel movie in years?*The mid-credit scene served as comedic relief. It sees Red Guardian seeming pleasantly surprised when he sees a cereal box with him on it. I need to own this cereal box asap.*The end-credit scene might have teased a potential showdown and/or team up between the Thunderbolts aka the New Avengers aka the New AvengerZ and the Fantastic Four. The final shot sees the Fantastic Four supposedly arriving on Earth.The end-credit scene also revealed that things are a little dicey between Bucky and Sam at the moment. Apparently, Sam sued the Thunderbolts for using the Avengers name.Additional thoughts:*The moment Sentry aka Bob imprisoned Yelena in her own form of purgatory where she witnesses her younger self commit murder over and over again was painful to see.*The moment Bucky appears to \"save\" the rest of the Thunderbolts was epic. Bucky throwing the explosive device at their vehicle kind of reminded me of when he attacked Nick Fury in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.*As someone who's very easily entertained and who has significantly enjoyed most of the films post-Endgame, I thought Thunderbolts* is exactly the type of Marvel film that's needed right now.ICYMI:The New Avengers and Bob will return.*The New Avengers aka The New AvengerzFinal verdict: 10/10."

See there is the asterisk after the title ... and the movie will address this as much as the \"origin\" of the name of the band of ... misfits. Who are actually a team of ... \"losers\" one might say. But while that may sound cute and funny ... there is more to it ... there is emotional depth.Mostly concentrated behind or on Pughs character Yelena (plus one) ... but you can attribute whatever she is going through on the others .. on various and different degrees. Our couple of seconds Captain America for example ... Red Guardian ... even Bucky, who seems to have an identity crisis ... is he a politician now? Still a superhero? Can he be with his past? There is a lot here ... not everything will be touched upon.So if you want to find something negative about a movie - you will always succeed. But the balance is right - you might not appreciate it all the way through - but the story is very tightly written and every character gets their moment. Some get a few more than others of course. And while Yelena is the main focus, Red Guardian (David Harbour) is another true gem of the movie. He may be the comic relief of the movie, but as a friend of mine said after watching the movie: he is doing such an amazing job, that you never feel annoyed by him. Comic reliefs can do that to you.So do you have to know any backstory to watch this? There have been a gazillion movies (MCU that is) and at least as many shows ... no you do not is the answer. But if you do, than you have a bit more to celebrate. Especially when it comes to Yelena (I reckon if you want one movie recommendation, I'd say Black Widow - that is for this movie specifically). You get the first glimpse of her movie wise there too.But back to this - which has enough action to satisfy your needs for a big budget movie - but as already said has the character depth to match that. We all have something inside of us - with some it is a deeper darkness, with others it is a smaller black hole ... and a saying goes: shadow of ones former self (in German Schatten seiner selbst) ... which again could count as a pun - and you'll understand once you watch the movie. It dares and goes places - again sorry for the pun.The CGI is more than decent enough - and is only meant as an addition and not the main attraction. If you are new to the world of the MCU, there are worse movies to begin with - you can certainly tell by the overall score (close to an 8 by the time of writing, over 10 thousand reviews at the moment) ... for new arrivals especially: almost every MCU movie has additional scenes during and after the credits. While the mid credit scene is more of a fun jokey kind of extra ... the one after the credits is important for the f...uture! You'll understand ... a must watch."

          "content": "Superheroes are supposed to be special, gifted individuals, so it logically follows that movies about them should be equally special. However, as has become all too apparent in recent years, that quality has been steadily eroding in these films due to oversaturation in the cinematic marketplace, a circumstance that naturally begs the question, how special (i.e., how different or distinguished) can they really be when there are so many of them? Sadly, that's the key issue weighing down this latest release in the Marvel Universe. Even though the film serves as an introduction to a new slate of Marvel superheroes, the picture isn't particularly groundbreaking given the many similar offerings that have preceded it in this genre. Despite this film's few minor modifications to an otherwise-formulaic and shopworn narrative, in many respects, the picture's story feels like it's been cobbled together from elements in other superhero adventures. For instance, the band of heroes here consists largely of a collection of courageous misfits reminiscent of releases in the \"Suicide Squad\" franchise. Then there are the nerdy sidekicks, who feel like they've been culled from the \"Deadpool\" pictures. And the primary challenge these characters face comes from the threat of dubious weaponized technology wielded by a power-hungry leader, a scenario at the heart of films like \"X-men: Days of Future Past\" (2014) and \"Logan\" (2017). This patchwork of elements consequently makes for a plotline that frequently feels forced and somewhat disjointed yet also ultimately predictable. Its few departures from the tried and true, while modestly interesting, feel as though they've been included to silence critics as supposed evidence of the production's efforts to incorporate fresh new material. To its credit, \"Thunderbolts*\" features some genuinely funny comic relief and commendable performances by Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, though the action sequences come across as a little stale and the unimpressive CGI effects could use some shoring up. Director Jake Schreier does a capable job of doing what this film was essentially designed to do - give diehard Marvel fans another fix of what they truly crave. And that's fine as far as it goes. But, in terms of its contributions to the annals of filmdom, this is far from memorable filmmaking, especially in terms of originality. After all, cookie cutters are supposed to be used for making baked goods, not movies."

          "content": "I just experienced Marvel's latest offering, \"Thunderbolts,\" and I'm still buzzing with excitement from what might be one of the MCU's most compelling entries to date. After some mixed reactions to recent Phase 5 projects, this film delivers exactly what the franchise needed-a perfect blend of action, emotion, and purpose that helps tie the broader MCU narrative together in meaningful ways.At the heart of this film lies an incredibly powerful father-daughter relationship that serves as its emotional anchor. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, and their scenes together are masterfully crafted, allowing both characters to develop in ways that feel authentic and earned. Their complex dynamic explores themes of redemption, trust, and the weight of past mistakes in ways that resonate far beyond the typical superhero movie fare. The writers deserve immense credit for crafting dialogue that hits hard without feeling manipulative or forced.The action sequences are absolutely spectacular, showcasing each team member's unique abilities while maintaining coherent storytelling throughout the chaos. The choreography is intricate yet easy to follow, and the visual effects team has outdone themselves, particularly during the breathtaking third-act battle. What's particularly impressive is how the action serves the character development rather than overshadowing it-each fight scene reveals something new about our anti-heroes and pushes their personal arcs forward.The film's pacing is notably well-balanced, alternating between high-octane action sequences and quieter, character-driven moments that allow the audience to catch their breath while deepening our investment in the story. The humor is well-placed and natural, never undermining the serious moments but providing necessary levity when appropriate. It's clear the creative team understood the delicate balance required for this type of story.One of the film's greatest strengths is how it manages its ensemble cast. Each member of the Thunderbolts gets their moment to shine, with clear character arcs and meaningful contributions to the overall narrative. The team dynamics feel genuine, with conflicts and alliances that evolve naturally throughout the story. The way these morally complex characters interact and gradually form bonds feels earned rather than forced, making their eventual cooperation all the more satisfying.The film's visual style deserves special mention, with distinctive cinematography that sets it apart from other MCU entries while maintaining connectivity to the broader universe. The color palette and lighting choices effectively reflect the morally gray nature of our protagonists, and the set design creates a tangible world that feels lived-in and real.The score complements the action and emotional beats perfectly, with themes that enhance key moments without overwhelming them. The music does an excellent job of building tension and highlighting the emotional impact of crucial scenes, particularly during the father-daughter moments that form the story's core.As for world-building, \"Thunderbolts\" expertly weaves together threads from previous MCU projects while establishing new elements that will clearly impact future stories. The integration feels organic rather than forced, and the revelations come at a perfect pace that keeps viewers engaged without overwhelming them with information.The two post-credit scenes are absolutely worth staying for-especially the final one, which delivered a jaw-dropping revelation that has massive implications for the MCU's future. Without spoiling anything, it's the kind of moment that will have fans theorizing for months to come and dramatically raises the stakes for what's ahead.Perhaps most importantly, this film succeeds in bringing a fresh perspective to the superhero genre while honoring what makes Marvel stories special. It tackles mature themes and complex moral questions while maintaining the entertainment value and spectacle we've come to expect from the MCU. The way it handles redemption, family, and the cost of doing the right thing adds layers of depth that will reward multiple viewings.\"Thunderbolts\" represents a significant turning point for the MCU, demonstrating that the franchise still has plenty of fresh stories to tell and new ground to explore. It's exactly the film needed to reinvigorate enthusiasm for this new phase of Marvel storytelling, promising exciting developments for the future while delivering a deeply satisfying standalone experience. Between the emotional depth, spectacular action, and those game-changing post-credit scenes, this film has set a new standard for what superhero movies can achieve."

          "content": "Marvel hasn't been at their best lately but Thunderbolts* has exceeded my expectations. Florence Pugh is even better this time, her portrayal of Yelena was already phenomenal in Black Widow, but this depth of sadness and regret is more sincere. The rest of the cast is quite good, each in their own way, I would maybe mention Alexei, who is still fighting his own battles just as much as Yelena but he's finally starting to adapt and cope, albeit he's still a little too much of a caricature. But we do need a few drops of lightheaded fun to balance what this movie holds. We have to talk about Bob. Marvel did something incredible here, this is a study on depression, raw and painful, there are no subtle allegories or refined metaphors, only the literal darkness that consumes everything. Starting with oneself, which I find particularly insightful. Anyone who has experienced depression can tell that this is pretty much what it feels like, no need to explain anything else about it. Bob is all of us. Even the superpower aspect is in the right place, it does feel like it's out of one's control so waiting out seems to be the only working survival strategy. Lewis Pullman was a perfect casting choice, his portrayal conveyed such deep despair and loneliness that even the audience could feel the need to run and give him a hug. Generally I would frown upon such a childish solution, but in this instance it makes some weird sense. Another strength of the story is the open discussion about addiction and where it leads, it's quite a heavy topic for a superhero movie, and yet, it feels right. The ending was somewhat disappointing, considering the possibilities it had but we can look past that. The rest of the movie holds the real value anyway."

One of the best movies after the Avengers infinity war for marvel & would definitely recommend. You find yourself rooting for some of the lesser characters in the movie & can't wait for the follow up in Avengers Doom . The usual characters like Guardian bring some humor to the situation. The movie has a nice pace with a few slow spots that don't last long. Make sure to stay for both credits! I plan to see it again. Overall, an excellent addition to the Marvel universe."

Florence Pugh shines as Yelena, leading a team of flawed antiheroes on a mission packed with action, emotion, and redemption. The film's exploration of mental health-especially through Lewis Pullman's Sentry-adds powerful depth. The rebranding to \"New Avengers\" felt earned, and the post-credits scene teasing the Fantastic Four gave me chills. With sharp writing, intense performances, and a gritty tone, Thunderbolts delivers a fresh, unforgettable Marvel experience. I loved every minute of it.I would highly recommend it for marvel lovers."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* surprised me with how emotionally rich and thought-provoking it was, especially for a superhero film. Rather than focusing on idealized heroes, it dares to explore its characters' flawed, wounded sides - people who have made serious mistakes and are still learning how to live with them. The film doesn't just deliver action; it offers reflection on what it means to be human.It touches on powerful themes: confronting the past rather than running from it, learning from one's mistakes, and understanding that growth often comes through pain. It reminds us that caring for mental health is just as vital as physical strength - and that asking for help is a sign of bravery, not weakness.One of the film's most heartfelt messages is about friendship. It reminds us that we don't have to go through pain alone, and that true friends-even the imperfect ones-are invaluable. The team in Thunderbolts is messy, distrustful, and fractured at first, but through shared struggle, they slowly learn to rely on each other, flaws and all.The film also explores feelings of emptiness, lack of purpose, and low self-worth - all deeply human experiences. It's a bold reminder that our imperfections don't define us negatively. We can keep going and build something meaningful despite our wounds that make us who we are.At its heart, Thunderbolts is about second chances. It believes that everyone can change - if they're willing. That real heroism isn't about being perfect, but about having the courage to face the darkness inside and still choose to fight, for yourself and others.This isn't just a superhero movie - it's a story about healing, redemption, and hope. A powerful, unexpected gem.Rating: 1000/10."

First of all the characters have so much personality and feel feasible and real, while watching this you can feel that the people that worked on this movie actually cared about the characters portrayed.Florence plugh is easily the standout in this movie, the emount of depth and emotion she brings to Yelena excels the character yo make her my favorite in the movie.My one gripe is Valentina is a kind of generic villain and it's your average \"take over the world\" type of character.Sentry deserves his own paragraph, cause he is the reason this movie is as good as it is, he's exactly what you want Sentry to be, and oh my gosh, when they first time they showed his suit I got chills.Overall if your a fan if the Infinity Saga this movie will give you the same fufillment and satisfaction when you finish this movie as the prime of Marvel.And the reveal of the Fantastic Four coming to earth 616 is honestly one of THE best end credits scenes of Marvel. Definitely give this movie a watch you will have a blast, even if your not a Marvel fan."

It's not why I went to see a Marvel action movie, and I expect if general audiences even come to the theater to see it most will be disappointed. Certainly, Florence Pugh shows off her dramatic acting skills and she is very watchable. But in the meantime there are over two hours of movie to fill, and for me the two hours got very, very long."

It's noticeably darker and more emotional than the usual Marvel formula. Instead of just relying on flashy effects and endless fight scenes, this film actually takes time to focus on the characters and their trauma. That felt really refreshing.The first half especially brings strong action and some creative use of powers - finally, Ghost's phasing ability is used in a way that actually makes sense and adds tension. The characters also feel more human this time. Bucky's still as badass as ever, Yelena really stands out, and the team dynamic mostly works.But... (SPOILER WARNING): Not everything lands. Taskmaster gets completely wasted - dies right at the beginning without any real impact. Ghost and Walker basically vanish halfway through the film and barely contribute after that. And the finale? Yeah... resolving things through the \"power of friendship\" felt way too cheesy and kind of undermined the heavier themes they were building up before.Still, for Marvel standards, it's refreshingly different and has way more heart than what we've come to expect. Not a masterpiece, but finally an MCU film that doesn't feel like a complete waste of time. I'd recommend it - just go in with tempered expectations."

With a cast led by Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, and Wyatt Russell, the film delivers strong performances and solid action sequences, but struggles at times with tone and pacing.The biggest strength of Thunderbolts lies in its character dynamics-watching this dysfunctional group try to function as a team provides both tension and surprisingly heartfelt moments. The film's humor is more grounded than your typical MCU fare, which fits its grimmer atmosphere, but not every joke lands. Some characters shine with emotional depth, while others feel underdeveloped or sidelined.The action is well-choreographed, and the film leans into its espionage and black-ops vibe, offering a refreshing break from the cosmic scale of recent Marvel entries. However, the plot occasionally feels disjointed, and the stakes aren't always clear.Overall, Thunderbolts isn't a game-changer, but it's a solid and entertaining ensemble piece that adds a new flavor to the Marvel mix. It's flawed but fun, and worth watching for fans looking for something a bit edgier."

Plus, it definitely had good emotional and psychological depth to it. Some of the humor hit while some of it didn't, and this movie has its flaws...While Julia Louis-Dreyfus was very good in Seinfeld, I just can't take her seriously as a mastermind behind the sinister and evil plot in a superhero movie. She doesn't really fit the role well and she was not that convincing to me. Plus, I'm not sure this team deserves the title or the recognition of being called \"The New Avengers\" yet. It felt a little inauthentic and less epically earned than the previous Avengers team that first held that title 10-15 years ago in the MCU. No group can ever truly replace that team in more than a lifetime.Generally though, I didn't have a bad time watching it! I'm open to seeing more of these characters together in future films."

Florence plays a member of a group of such not so famous heroes that are on the run after what happened in Endgame. Sebastian is trying to work within the government as a congressman and Julia is sort of the female version of Nick Fury-she wants to run things from behind the curtains. Wyatt plays a B grade Captain America called US Agent. Julia wants to get rid of all the loose ends and tries to kill Florence and her not so super friends but they escape, with the help of Lewis, who mysteriously has no memory of anything, even how he got there. When Lewis does start to remember things, two names-not one-pop into his head; Sentry and Void. Both names apply to him and they are opposites. Sentry is good with fantastic powers on the level of Superman and the Void just wants to destroy everything. It boils down to childhood trauma and covers some of the heroes' own depression as well-you learn during flashbacks. If you noticed the asterisk at the end of their name in the title-Thunderbolts*-you do learn why it's there and what it means. As the end credits start, there is a scene in a grocery store with one of the Thunderbolts and another scene at the very end involving some other heroes.It's rated PG-13 for violence, language and drug content and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes.I love super hero movies and this is a good one. I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

They did the \"bad guy\" justice and he is written quite well. As a person who reads comics and knew who he was, I am very pleased with the direction they chose. Furthermore, his character design is just amazing.The plot was simple but still enticing. I did find it a little predictable at times but still grabbed my attention. The red guardian was probably one of my favourite parts of the movie, he had so many funny moments and I very happy that he is back."

          "content": "I've been invested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man launched it back in 2008. For me, the franchise peaked with Avengers: Endgame in 2019, but there have been a few standout entries since, despite some clear missteps. Now over 30 films in, Thunderbolts* is the latest addition to the saga, and I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Julia Louis-Dreyfus returns as Valentina, assembling a team of outcasts and former villains from previous MCU films. But the twist comes when the group realizes she's the real threat, prompting them to turn against her in a clever, character-driven plot.The team dynamic is a major highlight. With Florence Pugh as Yelena, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Wyatt Russell as John Walker, Sebastian Stan reprising Bucky, and Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost, the film creates a dysfunctional but endearing ensemble. Their chemistry is laced with sharp banter and emotional beats, making their alliance feel refreshingly genuine. The film feels more grounded and self-contained than many recent Marvel entries, almost like an indie drama wrapped in a big-budget action movie, which gives it a unique identity within the franchise.One of the biggest surprises was the character of Bob, played by Louis Pullman. He adds an unexpected emotional weight to the story, especially as his arc takes a darker turn in the final act. Pullman's performance is subtle yet commanding, and Bob quickly became one of my favourite new characters in the MCU. The visuals in the third act, particularly the use of shadow and light, were striking, thanks to cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo's distinctive eye. The imagery in these scenes added a haunting texture that elevated the story's tone.Another standout element is the score by Son Lux. It's atmospheric, with moments that genuinely gave me chills. After a few rocky years for the MCU, Thunderbolts* feels like a promising course correction, more intimate, emotionally resonant, and stylistically fresh. It doesn't try to outdo the biggest Marvel spectacles, and that restraint works in its favor. I'll definitely be watching it again. It's a deeper, more thoughtful Marvel film and that's something I truly commend. Highly recommended."

This isn't your typical team-up flick it's a gritty, character-driven story that rebuilds the MCU's foundation in a way that feels earned and refreshing.Let's talk about Sentry, absolutely terrifying and captivating. The way they introduced him was masterful. He's not just a powerhouse; he's a ticking time bomb. The psychological tension he brings to the screen is unlike anything we've seen in Marvel before. You can feel the weight of his inner conflict every time he's on screen. Total scene-stealer.The team dynamic is chaotic in the best way possible. Everyone's broken in their own way, but that's what makes the stakes feel real. You're never quite sure who to trust or how things will play out.Thunderbolts is a perfect storm of intense action, psychological depth, and strong character work. It's a step forward for the MCU's future one that embraces darker themes without losing its heart.Peak fiction. Marvel is finally taking risks again, and they're paying off."

Nor great, better than decent or okay, solidly an 8 range out of 10.The beginning fees sort of boring for the first 20 minutes or so because you ar more aware of what's happening than the characters, what they're walking into.But suddenly you're at the 3rd act and asking \"how the hell are they gonna as the world THIS time against THAT?\"And the answer isn't more fisticuffs and super powers - it's actually a VERY personal and useful self-diagnose and healing tool that we can all take a cue and learn from. I was throughly impressed by this.Once again though, the star of this whole show is our beloved James Buchanan Barnes (I need more red guardian and winter soldier), but the rest of the cast fills in very nicely with Florence as the main focus. And even she has some personal emotional development that is beautiful.My only prime complaint really is that a lot of the dialogue delivery lines the whole first half of the film are REALLY bad (stiff, no fluid), and they come from acting legends like Julia, it's odd.My only minute complaint is that most of the secondary cast outwide Yelena, Bucky, and the one dude (you'll know) are really just sort of there. Even though they're used wel, I would've appreciated more usefulness of them (Ava, John Walker) rather than filler options. But they weren't bad.All in all good movie worth seeing in theaters. There are TWO post credits, and honestly the second one might be the funniest and best post credit scene in the MCU 😂"

Just enough simmering badness without being a goofy character of the villian. Not a bunch if fat on this one and went by quickly for a 2 hour 4 minute movie."

It was a blast! I was impressed with how the individual scenes explored the broken, vulnerable side to our ' wanna be heroes' but gave them just enough of a 'Avengers Assemble' moment to make it impactful but not cheesey! I would reccomend to anyone who is looking for a fun entertaining movie and any MCU fans who may have lost the faith!"

The chemistry between the team is electric, especially Yelena and Bucky, and the action feels more practical and intense than anything we've seen in years.This feels like early Marvel again-tight writing, emotionally driven characters, and a tone that actually dares to be different.

I was actually more psyched to see this compared to Brave New World and this didn't disappoint!

          "content": "Thunderbolts* opens to possibly the franchise' most introspective narration in years. Florence Pugh (playing as Yelena) claims she feels empty and devoid of purpose while jumping from the tallest building (trigger warning, alludes to self-harm). She subsequently fights through a hallway of guards while narrating that she feels bored. It's not surprising that she suffers from symptoms of depression after the death of her beloved sister, Natasha (Black Widow) but interestingly, she is also a symbolic representation of the MCU - as if describing its current state.Back in the 2000s, the most famous Marvel superheroes were brought to life by different studios, most especially Sony's Spiderman and Fox's X-Men. In fact, prior to 2007, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America were only known to comic book aficionados - they were essentially the leftovers. Then, almost two decades later, Iron Man is now as famous as Batman due to the MCU's success, but they are currently scrambling on how to continue telling compelling stories after the Infinity Saga. So, it's poetic that they are again using the MCU's own \"leftovers\" to revitalize the franchise.The film also deals with mature themes such as mental illness, drug abuse and familial neglect. Most of the characters are experiencing such crises in one way or another. As in life, a proven method toward healing from these problems is taking the first step - which is the acknowledgement of the illness. The character's eventual acceptance of their past failures paves their road to redemption, but the film takes this a step further. Reiterating again that these characters symbolically represent the MCU's current state, the narrative is also reconciling with the audience that the Avengers, or at least, the originals, are truly gone, and what we've been witnessing these past years was the struggle to fill the gap.There's actually a certain appeal when the story approaches self-awareness without breaking the fourth wall. It lends itself to a genuine desire to be better. The film adjusts its tropes, effectively leaning away, but not too far away, from the MCU's unhealthy habits while retaining what gave it its spark. For example, there is still humor, but it's not intrusive and comes from a place where the dialogue is genuinely spoken by broken people in the process of mending, so you never feel that it undercuts the more serious moments. David Harbour who plays Alexei / The Red Guardian is the best surrogate for this small change. He is loud, borderline obnoxious, but you understand that most of it stems from acting as an endearing father figure trying his hardest to impress his child, so it comes off more funny than annoying, as dads usually are.Meanwhile, choosing Sentry and his alter ego \"The Void\" as the crux of the story is a deliberate decision in a film that deals with mental health, on top of a narrative of looking for the next Avengers. Sentry is a Superman-coded character, only if Superman was plagued with childhood trauma, drug addiction, depression and anxiety. Lewis Pullman who plays Bob / Sentry manages to portray a character who seems aloof but also trying to do his best. Even upon the discovery of his powers, there's still hints of vulnerability and detachment, as if this invincible and all-powerful shell is nothing compared to the emotional wounds he always felt.It's also refreshing to see superhero films set aside the cliché sky beam and CGI war and explosions for the third act. While we still have some elements of this, the final showdown is a more intimate shifting corridor fight where the Thunderbolts* engage in an internal battle with The Void inside Bob / Sentry's mind. It may be a bit predictable, but it ultimately makes the film better.Finally, despite Yelena and the rest of the Thunderbolts* own struggles, their decision to help Bob is not just a desire for heroism, but stems from empathy and a shared experience. This is a realistic representation of people with similar challenges being drawn to others as a means of recovery through community and companionship. The overall story embodies an MCU that acknowledges its mistakes, and aspires to be better. It's like a person who finally started the healing process. After all, the MCU is a franchise that revitalized movie-going for a generation - it remains beautiful beyond its flaws."

Better yet, judiciously paced and finding the right tone, it constantly piqued my curiosity, both in terms of character development and action with insightful dialogue and effective one-liners from a cast who excel in their respective roles. Namely, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, Wyatt Russell as John Walker / U. S. Agent, Olga Kurylenko as Antonia Dreykov / Taskmaster, Lewis Pullman as Robert \"Bob\" Reynolds / Sentry / Void and Geraldine Viswanathan as Mel.Right up until a third act of climactic emotional richness, because \"Thunderbolts*\" is to the MCU what Rocky III and Superman III are to their respective cinematic universes, with also a last-minute twist and a post-credits scene that do not fail to give us a foretaste and a link to the continuation of the evolution of the MCU.In conclusion, don't miss \"Thunderbolts*\" on the big screen, because this sixth episode of the fifth phase of the MCU-second phase of the Multiverse saga-and 36th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is certainly a fresh and major Marvel film."

I was expecting a Suicide Squad but Marvel, which it kinda was, but also not really.I don't really get why the reviews are this high. It's not a bad movie per se, but this movie is very obviously a victim of rewrites and reshoots. It feels like they were trying to tie up a bunch of loose ends that previous writers were trying to set up, and really didn't have the time to do it properly.Now Sentry is a very interesting character that is thrown into the mix. I didn't know much about the character going in, but the idea of a Superman-style character with a dark presence tied to him is a very interesting concept that is quite a bit more compelling than the typical \"What if superman...but evil\" trope that we often see. The way the character is portrayed is reminiscent to me of Bipolar, where Sentry is an embodiment of a manic state, and Void is a depressive state. I'm not bipolar myself, so can't say if this is good rep or not, but I found the characterization fascinating.And I'm glad that they hid how prevalent Sentry is in the story from the marketing, but at the same time, I wish it was just a Sentry movie. The rest of the cast are just...meh. Bucky doesn't have much to do, and while Yelena is the de-jure main character of the movie, she's also kinda boring. Then there's two Captain America ripoffs, and Ghost, a mid-tier Antman villain. Wow...great cast of characters we got here for a massive MCU tentpole movie.Guess I'm in my cynical MCU fan phase. I hope Fantastic 4 is better."

Instead the heroes have to confront their awful pasts in a mental battle with the Void. The trailers didn't impress me too much but I had a feeling Marvel might have had an ace up their sleeve with Thunderbolts and I was right Thunderbolts is a really well made film."

I hoped that the movie would have more action scenes. But unfortunately, that did not happen.Thunderbolts* is one of the best films of the year, and I am very excited to see what the MCU films will have in in the future. When it comes to the score, I gladly give Thunderbolts* 9 out of 10."

          "content": "In short, I give this movie a 7. It is a decent movie that feels somewhat well balanced and enjoyable to an extent.My thorough review however highlight a point that superhero movies just lack a sense of realism. The reason why The Dark Knight is one of the most successful superhero movies of all time is because it demonstrates the epitome of what it means to be a hero. Hero's don't always win in the end, and when they do, it's usually at a great cost or tremendous sacrifice which sometimes begs the question, did the hero really win in the end?Movies have lost this theme, and the lack of seriousness in the movies is also the blame. This movie had all the elements of a great movie and threw it all away. I was at the edge of my seat when I witnessed a fight scene where the thunderbolts literally had their asses handed to them and all I could think was \"there is no way they're gonna win\". And I was instantly caught in a place of uncertainty where I knew that if they did win or gain some type of victory, that it wouldn't truly be a complete victory, and I was excited to see what that was. That feeling of rooting for the little guy was what I had, and then the movie just threw it away with an ultimately unsatisfying victory in which no one truly got hurt or killed. Completely disappointing.Sometimes you want to leave a movie with that feeling that the character did the best they could, and achieved the best outcome possible and you can then look forward to their road on making a somewhat full redemption with whatever pieces are left in another movie. We saw this with Avengers: Endgame where the hero's had small victories but ultimately lost, but in the end we connected with that because it's opened up that emotions of an uncertain, yet sad, but ultimately best case scenario ending given the circumstances.My point here is that is what life is, we do the best with what we can, and become the hero in our own life no matter how small the win may seem. We need those perplexing emotions from a movie where sacrifices are made, characters are left with a small win in the face of an overall tremendous defeat, but gathers the potential for a final comeback victory in another movie where ... the victory may not be clean, but it's the courage and redemption story that we care most about, not a happy ending."

The chemistry and banter between the team members were some of the best parts of the film, and I loved that none of them were portrayed as perfect heroes. Each character felt flawed and real.While the whole cast delivered strong performances, Sentry especially stood out to me since this was his first appearance - he instantly grabbed my attention. My only real complaint is how quickly Taskmaster was taken out; it felt a bit rushed and could've been handled better.Overall, Thunderbolts is one of my favorite MCU entries, just a bit below The Avengers for me. I'd definitely recommend it to Marvel fans, especially those who enjoy team dynamics with a darker edge."

Very good writing with an interesting plot, emotional scenes, and characters were written great, especially with Yelena and Sentry. The movie has funny moments too!

The team dynamic works surprisingly well and brings some genuinely entertaining moments. However, the emotional depth didn't quite meet my expectations-there was a lot of hype beforehand, but the film keeps a certain distance, making it harder to fully connect. The visuals and action sequences are well executed, but nothing groundbreaking. Still, it's a step in the right direction after several weaker Marvel entries. Not a masterpiece, but definitely worth watching for fans of the genre."

Yes, nor the movie, nor the plot, are really original (all hail the power of friendship), but it is still really enjoyable. The pacing is really good - I still can't believe it was two hours long - the humorous scenes really hold up with the rest of the script, and the action sequences are quite fun.The characters are well rounded, the new introduction doesn't feel forced, even if it's not that 'deep' or characterized, it offers a good base for future movies.I really liked that even thought it is not a solo movie for Yelena, she still remains the center of the story, giving space to viewers to fully appreciate her, more than it was possible to do in the Black Widow movie.On the bad side, some scenes felt a little bit too sweet, if you get what I mean. Taking the 'show don't tell' a bit too far by showing more that it was necessary, to the point that it was redundant - I won't name the scene to avoid spoilers, and the same goes for some 'my life has sucked up until now' lines of dialogue. However, the downsides are well balanced by the good things in the movie.I feel that if the MCU continues in this direction better movies could come out, surely better than the last ones made. I really hope that they continue down this line, it really felt like the good old times - maybe a bit worse, but you get the gist.Good movie, would recommend."

However, it was a slow burn, then it became exciting, then it slowed down again.I like when there is an action opener at the beginning. It kind of started off sad. I did like the message though, letting people know you are not alone. I thought that was brilliant and much needed in this world.The stand out actor for me was Lewis Pullman he was EXCELLENT in this movie. He was perfect for the role of Bob and I enjoyed watching him play that character. Florence Pugh did well as Yelena, I do wish she had the long hair like she did in Black Widow. She still looked beautiful and did a great job in the fight scenes.I also thought the actor who plays Red Gaurdian was great. He always makes me laugh I think his name is David Barbour. He did well in this movie.I was upset that we didn't see more of Sebastian Stan!! He is one of my favorite characters from the Avengers movies and the Captain America movies. He had a few spots but didn't really show up till the middle of the movie.I think Julie Dreyfuss is a great actress. I just didn't think this role in Thunderbolts was a good fit for her funny personality. I kept trying to take her seriously, but I just kept waiting for her to make a joke and make me laugh. Lovely actress!Overall, decent movie!"

          "content": "The movie \"Thunderbolts*\" was actually a good movie.The ad campaign focused on the fact that the movie would look AND sound beautiful and I can't say I was disappointed in either one. There are many wonderful shots and visual ideas that have added to the movie. Especially I want to point out the imagery of the main villain of the movie.In addition, the plot was not terrible which is now a surprise for a Marvel movie. The jokes hit most of the time, the visual gags didn't make me want to leave the cinema and all in all the plot was not the biggest of cliches. It's simple, in a way it was even similar to \"Suicide Squad\" by Gunn with the vibe of Ayer's version. A group of misfits (and Bucky) team up against one big evil which is not as bad as you all think (as I've said, a cliche but not the worst kind).The characters all feel in their places, like they actually have a reason to be on the screen which is nice for Marvel. All, but Bucky. The man who went most of the movie rocking only one facial expression you'll see in any trailer; poster; ad material.Still, despite the satisfactory plot, characters and visuals I still have a couple o problems with the movie.First of all, the movie feels cut up, like it's missing at least 15 minutes of footage all cut from the same point in the narrative. The ending felt weirdly rushed and made me check the time on my phone because I felt lied to about the length of the movie.Second of all, the only reason for this film's existence is to tease the new Avengers. The Thunderbolts don't reveal any interesting details about the already existent characters and fails to make me interested in the fate of the new ones. The ending directly connects the viewer to the beginning of the next \"Avengers\" movie and as a person who stopped caring for Marvel it felt useless.The movie is worth its time, it is nice to watch, the plot does not make your brain feel rotten and the actors successfully play their roles. Aside from that, the CGI is not as terrible as it usually is which is another plus. All in all, it is worth a watch yet I'd lie if I'd say that the hype around it is not exaggerated."

This is Marvel's version of Suicide Squad but it is better than both of those films.. it has a balanced humour which felt natural instead of cringe and forced, the lift climbing scene is funniest scene of this movie.. Sentry was also great and he's Marvel's Superman, this film actually showed us concept of what if one of the most powerful being turn into villain which is something DC was doing under Snyder's era but WB failed that universe.. Anyways I've enjoyed everything especially fight scenes which felt good on big screen with a nice choreography, visuals looked amazing especially during the climax it is one of best looking MCU films in years in terms of VFX and picture quality, I also enjoyed the chemistry between characters who never wanted to work with each other but they do because they don't have any other way l..Yelena and John Walker became 2 of my most favourite characters from this universe.. only thing which I didn't liked is that climax could've been more better but then again it is not The Avengers so it works.. Overall Thunderbolts is a must watch for Marvel fans because in a era where this franchise relies on Nostalgia and Multiversal stuff this movie provides an fresh breath of air... Don't miss out the post credit scenes because it set up future events especially AVENGERS DOOMSDAY which we will be witnessing exactly this time next year...."

          "content": "'Whoever simultaneously perceives his shadow and his light sees himself from two sides and thus places himself in the center.'\n-- Carl Jung\nAfter Marvel's heyday and splendor of the last decade, there came a natural creative decline in its productions. The formula felt worn out; spectacular action sequences and inserting moments of humor into critical moments in the plot were no longer enough.They had to find a catalyst for a cinematic universe that was losing momentum and beginning to generate disinterest.That's why Thunderbolts has a different tone. Marvel becomes existentialist and decides to address the existential voids of its characters. Thunderbolts speaks to the feeling of inner emptiness. Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) makes it clear from the first sequence that, when she's not working, she feels an emptiness inside, a loneliness that consumes her.That's what Thunderbolts is about: delving into the psyche of its characters. Characters tired of living on the periphery of themselves, of being outcasts. Tired of feeling like they don't fit in anywhere.The plot somehow harnesses many concepts from the brilliant Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. Especially about the duality of light and shadow in human nature and the individual responsibility to embrace and understand those forces within us in order to find balance.Yes, Marvel delves deeply and psychoanalyzes its characters.As viewers, we accompany them on their journey and witness them confront their darkness while forming a bond between them.Sure, there are good action sequences and top-notch special effects. But unlike other Marvel productions, in Thunderbolts, these aspects aren't what sustain the narrative and its fluidity.That's why the film works; there is psychological depth in the character development, they show vulnerability, and we learn about their personal demons.As they say, renew or die. Here Marvel takes a firm step forward in its attempt to shake off the creative slump it was in."

A few good projects (GotG 3, Born Again) and a lot of mediocre (Captain America 4, Hawkeye) or absolutely abysmal(Secret Invasion) stuff thrown out. Most people probably didn't expect a movie about a group made up of several variations of \"punch and shoot secret agents\" to be one of the better films of the post-Endgame MCU. And yet it is. Some of the main problems in MCU movies are present: unnecessary humor (though not as much as normal), conflicting tone, and some lacking writing/dialogue. However, when it's good, it's good. Standout performances from Florence Pugh as Yelena and Lewis Pullman as Bob/Sentry/Void. The latter of these might be the most faithfully adapted character in all 5 phases. Good use of sets and practical effects as well as entertaining fight scenes (a standout one takes place involving Sentry). Thunderbolts* is a fun summer action flick with some surprisingly dark and emotional moments that I really appreciated. Between this and Daredevil: Born Again, it almost feels like the MCU is trying to course correct in time for Fantastic Four and Avengers :Doomsday/Secret Wars. Here's hoping it continues this trajectory."

The score, lighting and costumes (thankfully with headgear and equipment that wasn't mainly CGI, giving it a more real look) really brought this movie together and the family dynamic is something the MCU has lacked since it's inception (No, the Avengers were more like friends and colleagues rather than a family).The only noticeable flaws with this film is the lack of exploration of side characters pasts (Like Ghost, who honestly felt like the biggest person who should receive a more detailed backstory in the Void, hell even Walker got one, or Bucky, no Winter Soldier vs Barnes fight which was definitely a missed opportunity) and the lack of well, a villain, albeit Valentina serves and will still serve as a future antagonist, but the lack of Sentry is a bit of a shame since Pullman delivers a fantastic interpretation of Robert and his instability. Additionally, it's a shame Taskmaster gets capped considering even with the fact it's a genderswap, I thought as they did with Ghost and Walker, her character would get more layers to it, but it's not the end of the world considering She's a Black Widow side villain who hasn't appeared for 4 years.Overall, great film, easily top 10 in the MCU, even top 7 maybe, 9/10."

But The Void's appearance in the trailer alone was intriguing enough for me to attend the premiere.It's actually good and I was surprised that they went the route of exploring mental health like Bob's bipolar disorder with depression, however it's still done kid-friendly and I can't stand the constant jokes about Red Guardian. So somewhat only a minor risktaking here but I also understand that even darker topics, like if Bob would've mentioned S-word attempts, may not suit a Marvel movie but it would've been a bold move enough to create discussion.Other than Red Guardian as an annoying element and the ridiculous asterisk title reveal in the end it was fun to see Ava's character again but I feel sorry for Olga Kurylenko who only came back for 2 minutes and then killed off. What was that all about?Pugh does a tremendous job, this is her movie and Pullman was pretty good too. I would've changed his introduction tho, like him selected as Sentry but early on turned into The Void within first 30 min.Also, that amnesia thing in the end was confusing, did it happen only to him or everybody (except Thunderbolts) else trapped? Because that girl looked uneffected when coming back, realistically she would've gone thru a real nightmare and being traumatized."

          "content": "In 2025, \"Marvel Studios\" released \"Thunderbolts\", directed by Jake Schreier. The story follows a team of anti-heroes - Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, John Walker, Taskmaster, Ghost, and Red Guardian - assembled by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine for a special mission. But it quickly becomes clear that the heroes themselves have become part of a much more dangerous game, one that not all of them entered willingly. How their path ends is a question that keeps the tension high until the very finale.In recent years, Marvel has earned a reputation for putting out mixed-quality projects. Since \"Endgame\", there have been a few solid exceptions, but most new titles felt like attempts to reclaim lost glory. Against this backdrop of lowered expectations, \"Thunderbolts\" stands out - at least for me. Jake Schreier handles the balancing act well, giving every character their moment without letting any of them get lost in the shuffle. It's a skillful job. You can feel his experience in presenting just enough of each character while maintaining cohesion and managing to make the bizarre feel watchable. Not surprising, given his background directing \"Shameless\" and \"Beef\" - both wild rides in their own right. That said, despite the ensemble, the film clearly centers around Yelena Belova's arc. Her internal conflict and search for identity are the emotional core of the story. Still, the rest of the team gets a fair share of attention.The film's central theme is loneliness. Each character is lost in their own way: some are struggling with past mistakes, others are cut off from the world, consumed by fear. This motif runs through the whole film - the characters are closed-off, fractured, trying to fight their inner darkness. And while this is still very much a popcorn blockbuster, the effort to address such a mature, painful topic deserves credit. Not all of the film's conclusions are fully convincing, but the desire to say something meaningful feels genuine. The darkness in this story is shown with care. Everyone has their own version of it.Humor is another of the film's strengths. There's plenty of it, but it's well-measured - lightening the mood when needed, deepening character dynamics where appropriate. Red Guardian, in particular, steals scenes with perfectly timed one-liners. He's still the same lovable fool, and David Harbour delivers once again. The group's banter and bickering make them feel like a real (if chaotic) team - rough around the edges but alive.The performances are solid across the board. Florence Pugh once again nails Yelena Belova, bringing both emotional exhaustion and biting wit. Sebastian Stan remains a dependable emotional anchor as Bucky Barnes - and even channels \"Mission: Impossible's\" Ethan Hunt in a couple of moments. Wyatt Russell makes a strong John Walker, cocky but still uneasy. David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, Olga Kurylenko, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus all feel right in their roles, delivering what's needed with the right tone. Even Geraldine Viswanathan makes an appearance, straight from the underrated series \"Miracle Workers\", with a solid performance. Lewis Pullman's role as The Sentry is intriguing, though it could use more depth.Visually, the film is up to par: slick action, solid effects, and a sense of scale. Nothing jumps out as iconic, but it all looks good. The soundtrack blends well with the pacing and atmosphere, keeping the tone steady.The ending is a bit of a mixed bag. It's not bad, but after such well-paced development, it feels slightly rushed. Still, the film maintains a sense of rhythm and leaves a satisfying overall impression. And yes - the \"asterisk\" in the title finally gets explained. A small but nice touch for sharp-eyed viewers.That said, \"Thunderbolts\" doesn't quite measure up to Marvel's strongest entries. It's not a bad film - far from it - but it's also not groundbreaking. There are worthy moments here, but truly powerful scenes are few and far between.\"Thunderbolts\" left me with a positive impression. With its flaws, rough edges, and some questionable choices, it's still a film that \"works\". Maybe because expectations were low, or maybe because for the first time in a while, it feels like Marvel tried to tell a story with a bit more depth than usual.7 out of 10."

The reason why I say this is crazy is because I actually care about every single one of the Thunderbolts, the movie is constantly funny, but it's also quite deep and emotional at the same time. Lewis Pullman Florence Pugh Wyatt Russell and David Harbour were standouts. Lewis Pullman's entrance to the MCU was outstanding the depth he's given Sentury. Wyatt Russell made me invested in US Agent in a way I didn't think I would. He's still trying to be Cap. Harbour is hilarious. Pugh is just out standing. The chemistry between the two is amazing i was laughing and crying at multiple points between the movie they truly feel like a father and daughter."

Each character gets the development they deserve, and Florence Pugh, the main lead, does an outstanding job. Red Guardian and the brief Captain America cameo provide some hilarious moments that will definitely make you laugh.Thunderbolts is directed by Jake Schreier, whose previous work, Beef (definitely worth watching), I've seen. He handles the film really well. The action scenes, especially the hand-to-hand combat, are intense and well choreographed. The cinematography is stunning-wide-angle shots and quick cuts between characters enhance the visual experience. Lastly, the background music fits perfectly with the tone of the movie.The new character introduced, Bob AKA Sentry, is fantastic. His Sentry suit looks amazing, and when he first uses his powers, it will give you goosebumps. That scene is definitely one of the best.In the end, the movie provides an emotional connection for each character, giving the audience something to reflect on.The post-credit scene is crucial for the future, so make sure to stick around for it."

All of these C- to B-level characters that I didn't really care about before-I care about now. It was a surprisingly emotional movie, and also super funny.My only gripes with the movie are that I wish we got to see more of Sentry, and I thought his suit looked kinda goofy. The CGI for Sentry was also pretty bad-he looked like he was made of rubber. Ghost was such a flat character that I'm honestly confused as to why she was even in the film. And once again, they continue to do Taskmaster dirty.I loved the team dynamic so much that I wanted to see more back-and-forth banter between them.Overall, it was a very good watch with a great message attached to it. I'm genuinely surprised-and excited for what Marvel has to offer in the future."

You don't have to watch the 30 Disney+ slop TV series to follow anything happening in this movie, probably since Dr Strange or Black Panther 1 we have a Marvel movie which can just stand alone by itself, don't get fooled by the YouTube warriors, give this movie a try it'll be worthwhile."

Amazing chemistry and overall a 8.7/10 for me."

          "content": "Marvel's *Thunderbolts* attempts to reignite interest in the next chapter of the MCU, with a darker, more grounded approach that recalls the studio's earlier, character-driven successes. At the center of it all is Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova, still grappling with the loss of her sister, Natasha Romanoff. Pugh brings her trademark charisma and emotional depth, anchoring the film with a performance that's equal parts sardonic and sincere.Yelena is reluctantly paired with a crew of outcasts and former adversaries: Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), and others who've been branded expendable. Their mission-betrayed by their manipulative handler Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus)-unfolds along a familiar yet satisfying arc: from mutual distrust to reluctant camaraderie.While the plot isn't groundbreaking and leans heavily on genre tropes, the film is elevated by strong performances and dynamic chemistry among the cast. The action sequences are competent, if not especially innovative, but they serve the story rather than distract from it.What makes *Thunderbolts* stand out is its commitment to character. Unlike recent Marvel entries bloated with multiverse mayhem and CGI spectacle, this film focuses on flawed, human figures navigating moral gray areas. It may not reach the heights of *Infinity War* or *Endgame*, but it offers a refreshing return to storytelling fundamentals-something the franchise has sorely needed.In a post-*Endgame* MCU that has often struggled to find its footing, *Thunderbolts* feels like a genuine attempt to reset the tone and rebuild the universe from the ground up. It's the most engaging Marvel film in years-though that may say as much about the franchise's recent missteps as it does about this film's quality."

It could have used more Sentry action sequences but they chose to focused on character development instead of ver the top spectacle.

          "content": "A DERIVATIVE DISAPPOINTMENT\nIn the ever-expanding landscape of superhero cinema, \"Thunderbolts\" stands as perhaps the most egregious example of creative bankruptcy I've witnessed in the past decade. Marvel Studios' latest offering isn't just bad-it's an insult to the intelligence of its audience and a waste of both time and money.The premise had potential: a team of antiheroes and former villains assembled for high-risk missions. Instead, what we get is a shameless attempt to recreate the lightning-in-a-bottle success of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" without any of the charm, originality, or heart that made that franchise beloved.From the opening sequence, \"Thunderbolts\" makes it painfully obvious that it's following a well-worn template. The film desperately throws together a group of misfit characters, forces awkward banter between them, and punctuates action sequences with nostalgic needle drops that feel calculated rather than earned. The formula is so transparent it borders on plagiarism, yet lacks the self-awareness to acknowledge its derivative nature.The cast, despite featuring considerable talent, seems lost in a sea of underdeveloped characterization. Characters that showed promise in previous appearances are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures spouting quips that land with a thud in the silent theater. The chemistry that should be the foundation of any team film is nonexistent, making it impossible to invest in their journey or care about their fate.The plot, if one can call it that, is a convoluted mess of MacGuffins and contrivances that exists solely to move characters from one CGI setpiece to another. The villain's motivations are paper-thin, the stakes never feel consequential, and the resolution comes so abruptly and illogically that it suggests significant portions of the story were left on the cutting room floor-or worse, never written at all.Director handling of action sequences is particularly disappointing. Where \"Guardians\" director James Gunn crafted memorable, character-driven moments of spectacle, \"Thunderbolts\" offers only chaotic editing and murky visuals that make it difficult to follow what's happening, let alone care about it. The fight choreography lacks imagination, and the over-reliance on CGI results in weightless action that generates no tension or excitement.The film's attempts at humor are perhaps its greatest sin. Every joke feels focus-grouped to death, designed to elicit the same reactions as better films rather than establishing its own comedic identity. The constant barrage of pop culture references and meta-commentary comes across as desperate rather than clever, and the few genuinely amusing moments are immediately undercut by the film explaining its own jokes.Even the production design lacks distinction, with generic spacecraft, weapons, and costumes that could have been lifted from any number of recent sci-fi action films. The color palette alternates between drab military settings and oversaturated alien worlds without any cohesive visual language to tie them together.The score, composed by,attempts to recreate the emotional resonance of classic rock tracks used in \"Guardians\" but ends up as mere background noise, forgettable the moment it stops playing.What's most frustrating about \"Thunderbolts\" is the wasted potential. The comics offer rich source material with morally complex characters and thought-provoking scenarios. Instead, Marvel has delivered a cynical product that seems designed primarily to extend a franchise rather than tell a meaningful story.As superhero fatigue continues to set in among general audiences, films like \"Thunderbolts\" only accelerate the genre's decline. It represents everything critics of the genre have decried: formulaic storytelling, excessive CGI, and a prioritization of franchise-building over narrative integrity.If you value your time and money, avoid \"Thunderbolts\" at all costs. This Guardian of the Galaxy wannabe doesn't just fail to reach the heights of its obvious inspiration-it crashes and burns spectacularly, leaving nothing but disappointment and the faint hope that studios might eventually learn that audiences deserve better than pale imitations of past successes."

The fight scenes and action blend perfectly with the dark and sad storyline of the movie. It depicts depression and it's one of the few super hero movies that makes the characters regret what they have done in the past, live in fear and loneliness, and does that incredibly well.The actors, their roles and the chemistry between them is insane. Florence was and is the bast part of any movie/show she stars in, as proven by Black Widow, Hawkeye, Midsommar etc. And finally Thunderbolts*. Her acting is outstanding, you can feel every single emotion that Yelena feels.And finally the humor and the comedy of the movie is pure perfection, something we had in Deadpool and Wolverine but didn't get in other recent MCU movies, so we really needed it.The storyline is wonderful, the end twist and the post-credit scene - wild.This movie brought so much hope for the future of the MCU, I sincerely hope Fantastic Four: First Steps don't ruin it!

I said I would believe it when I saw it... boy did I see it. This darted right up to the top of my Marvel movie favorites. I don't think it can place #1 but it is definitely up there.

SPOILER: they teased more of these characters to come and I think I'm just as excited for those as I was for the adventures of the original Avengers. Already can't wait for what is to come. 10/10."

The bits were charming! And the action was pretty freaking cool...If comedy is the hallmark of perspective then perspective indeed! They were able to wrangle the humanity out of this story in a way that made me laugh, cry and really feel it despite the self-aware goofball nature of it all.After rotating in psych wards and communing with fellow vets- the theme of shame and loneliness is real. Incredible vindication, visceral stunts, beautiful frames and surprisingly original! This could be a great way to end the Avenger machine."

It wasn't witty, there was no new message and Bucky just looked lost. MCU has created another jumbled up movie, I don't know how anyone can give this a 10. If I saw this on a streaming site I probably would have switched it off, as it is I saw it at the cinema so had to watch it. Perfect for those who have never seen a superhero movie before."

The way the whole movie is about mental health, while tackling the kind of relevant enough politics that can be expected from this type of movie, as well as executing pretty cool action sequences, all came together beautifully. The mental health aspect, especially towards the end, really made me give this four stars instead of a 3.5. It's not devoid of problems, but when they get it good, it's really good. The 3D felt very unnecessary though, and the aspect ratio switching in Imax didn't feel very impactful, but that may be because the last film I saw was Sinners, which was incredible.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is so easy to hate here, just like how easy it was to hate everyone, including her, in the final seasons of Seinfeld."

Obviously the thing you bank on for a movie like this is the overall dynamic between these Anti-Heroes. Everyone on this team was super solid.One of the biggest standouts for me was Florence Pugh. This was honestly her movie. I thought she led it so admirably and had some amazing character growth in this one. Another standout would be Lewis Pullman as BOB. He was really the Wild Card in this one. They nailed Sentry in this one. Both emotionally, and in the action. I would not be surprised if both of them played a bigger role in the MCU going forward. Of Course David Harbour as Red Guardian is always delightfully hilarious and wildly entertaining to watch. While I wished we got more time to explore characters like Hannah John Kamens Ghost and Wyatt Russells US Agent, I thought they played there roles admirably and were entertaining to watch.And of course the action was really good. It's Marvel! This movie has some really grounded action, and did a good job showcasing each characters abilities on screen. Shout-out to whoever did the fight choreography in this one. And the score done by Son Lux was really good. Some tracks really stoodout to me.The MCU really needed this. I think this might be in the top 5 best movies in the multiverse saga. Go see this.

Only Yelena and Bucky are tolerable and at that only some of the time. The action set pieces are tepid and uninspiring though some of the fistfights are well done. Even worse it has one of the worst climaxes in Marvel history with almost zero action. A couple of saves from the team and then we go into Sentry's boring mind and the battle ends with psycobable nonsense. The first half is so dark you can barely see what's happening and that's something I tend to laugh about when others complain about it but it's noticeable here. How this has such a high score is unfathomable but I predict the movie will fail. The recent Cap America Falcon movie was way more entertaining than this slop. The villain Sentry was at first somewhat intriguing but quickly became boring. It also didn't help that my wife kept pleading to leave but I stubbornly stayed hoping it would get better. It actually got worse. Worst thing in the movie is Harbour as Red Guardian forever screaming like a lunatic. Both credit scenes are rather blah with the exception of the final shot in the after credits scene. But it would have been better to witness that after that particular movie is seen. Best thing I can say about Thunderbolts is at least\nit's better than Madame Web and The Marvels but that's not saying much."

Then Bob aka Sentinel turns into void turns people to dust gets a hug and then turns everyone back the end.

That is no critique aimed at the actors no but at the absolute terrible script. The only one who acts relatively well is the guy playing Sentinel yes I buy the drug addicted loser.You may say that this is not an action focused movie and it does try to focus on the mental problems of the cast....yeah it does a terrible job doing that. Nothing of that is any new. Their problems are literally standard amongst every marvel character.No matter how hard I try the only good thing I can say about this movie is that the scene when Void appears looked awesome.

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts\" concludes Phase 5 with a noticeably darker tone compared to other MCU movies, and while i think it's the best of the phase, I'd say it's a good movie but not great. Hear me out.The first part of the film was actually really strong. The introduction of the characters was engaging, and I found myself genuinely caring about most of them except for Ghost, who turned out to be the weakest link in the team. The story in the first half had solid pacing and build-up. The dialogue was sharp, and the Blackflash scenes were impressive and have a great meaning to our characters depth.However, the payoff didn't meet my expectations. In the second half, things started to fall apart for me. The villain's backstory, particularly how he got his second powers, wasn't explained well and felt rushed. The most disappointing part was how the team dynamic completely disappeared. It suddenly shifted to focus on just two characters, which felt like a missed opportunity, especially after such a promising start.One thing I really wish the MCU would move away from is this recurring idea of \"saving\" the villain instead of confronting or defeating them. It's getting repetitive and needs a fresh approach.Overall, Thunderbolts is a watchable movie with some standout moments, and without a doubt, Red Guardian is the highlight of the film."

By examining mental health, it has actually important and meaningful things to say about universal human experiences. It feels like a real movie because it's about an interesting idea, and it thoroughly explores it in richly nuanced and subtextual detail. There is genuinely great humor in the film, but it takes itself seriously and lets the serious scenes develop without undercutting them with cheap jokes. All the characters have great chemistry due to the amazing performances. The action is grounded and gritty. Thematically, it is very heavy and dark, but the film handles it in a mature way. Although it tends to over-explain its messages by the end, overall, Thunderbolts* is a refreshingly creative and singularly cohesive story that represents a much-needed step in the right direction for the MCU."

          "content": "I've always appreciated when Marvel steps away from its usual roster to spotlight lesser-known heroes or teams. It doesn't always work-Eternals being a prime example-but I respect the effort. Thunderbolts follows this tradition, focusing on a relatively obscure, morally ambiguous team. It's Marvel's closest equivalent to DC's The Suicide Squad, composed mostly of villains or anti-heroes. After the letdown of Captain America: Brave New World, there's a lot riding on this film with Avengers: Doomsday looming ahead. So, does Thunderbolts succeed, or is it another misfire?Surprisingly, I really enjoyed the story. While it echoes the familiar trope of a dysfunctional group learning to work together, it avoids being a direct copy of Suicide Squad. There are no bombs in necks or forced compliance. Instead, the film focuses on character-driven growth and survival under pressure. What really stood out was its thoughtful handling of themes like depression and mental illness-it's done with care and respect, adding emotional depth to the narrative.Yelena is front and centre here, and Florence Pugh gives a standout performance. Her portrayal captures Yelena's emotional struggles and growth with nuance and intensity. Another highlight is Lewis Pullman as Sentry. He's a fantastic addition to the MCU, delivering a layered performance that oscillates between terrifying power and fragile vulnerability. The way The Void-a key part of Sentry's character-is handled is especially commendable. It's creepy, unsettling, and exactly what I hoped for.The film also does justice to returning characters like Red Guardian and Bucky. Red Guardian, whose development in Black Widow was a pleasant surprise, continues his journey as a flawed but well-meaning father figure, especially toward Yelena. Bucky, too, gets his moment to shine, no longer running from his past but actively choosing to do good. Interestingly, the chemistry between Red Guardian and Bucky provides unexpected humour and charm-some of their scenes together are among the most entertaining.Despite the darker themes, Thunderbolts still delivers laughs, and they feel organic rather than forced. The humour doesn't undercut the drama, which is something Marvel has struggled with in the past. The action is also strong, especially a chaotic facility battle where the team turns on each other, and a creative, unconventional final act. Son Lux's score is serviceable, but their work on the Thunderbolts theme stands out.That said, the film isn't without flaws. For one, it feels like a poor sequel to Black Widow. Taskmaster, despite her flaws in that film, played a key role in Natasha's arc-but here she's reduced to an afterthought, undermining both her character and the previous movie. There's also no mention of Melina, Yelena's mother figure, which feels like a significant omission given her importance. Ghost, another team member, is barely developed. The film offers little to no context on what happened to her or Bill Foster since Ant-Man and the Wasp, and her motivation for joining Valentina remains unclear.Also, while Yelena's emotional journey is fleshed out, the rest of the team's arcs are glossed over. During the final battle, we don't see their personal struggles and their growth happens off-screen, which weakens the emotional impact. I also wish there were a bit more bonding moments between the team. There are only 1 or 2 scenes off the top of my head where the team is not bickering or arguing or being mean to each other but there really should have been more.Still, Thunderbolts feels like a much-needed course correction for the MCU. It balances humour and heart, delivers compelling action, and explores mature themes with surprising sincerity. It's the first Marvel film in a while that genuinely makes me excited for what's next-especially Avengers: Doomsday. And for once, the post-credit scene doesn't feel like a creatively bankrupt setup. That alone is worth celebrating."

          "content": "Of all the upcoming MCU films, THUNDERBOLTS is the one I was most looking forward to seeing. I really liked the original comic series, it had a great premise-a group of super villains masquerade as heroes to win the unsuspecting public's trust-with a lot of storytelling possibilities. But that was not the film we got from Disney/Marvel. Instead, they took some D-listers and loose ends from other films and streaming shows, and threw them together to form a ragtag group of seeming losers, who in the end, are the ones who have to save the day. So we get Bucky Barnes (the former Winter Soldier), Yelena Belova and Alexi Shostakov (the Black Widow's sister and father), John Walker (a failed super soldier who couldn't fill Captain America's shoes), Ava Starr, (Ghost, the antagonist from ANT MAN AND THE WASP), all of whom have done off the book work for Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, a shady character with an even shadier past, who is now the head of American intelligence. Valentina is being investigated by Congress, and is eager to have anything incriminating in her past clean slated, starting with the dubious people she employed to do her dirty work. When they escape a trap to have them eliminated, her former employees, now intended victims, have no choice but to band together with Bucky's help, and take down Valentina before she can try and take them out again. Oh, then there's Bob, a human test subject from a failed experiment who was put on ice, tagging along with them. Stuff happens, and then more stuff happens.What I liked about THUNDERBOLTS: The dynamic between the characters worked very well. They earned my sympathy by leaning into the fact that they are \"never weres\" or \"has beens\" who have to live with failure and regret. I was rooting for them even when, in the case of John Walker, they act like jerks. A lot of this is because of the actors, who really did commit to the material, even if some of them are too talented and are above it. Always glad to see Sebastian Stan back as Bucky in a big way, and David Harbor is perfect to play the poppa bear part as Alexi. The standout is Florence Pugh's Yelena, with her expressive face, which portrays this character's regret and anguish so well. Lewis Pullman (who so resembles his father, Bill) hits the right note as Bob, whose shy and traumatized persona masks the fact that he is really The Sentry, one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel universe. Julia Louis Dreyfus's Valentina, the Big Bad of the film, is more on point than the producers could have imagined when the film went into production, as she seems far too reminiscent of certain national security figures in the current administration in Washington. The script is thankfully free of the kind of snarky humor that ruined a number of other MCU films for me (talking about you, THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER), as it is clear they were not trying to make a comedy pretending to be a super hero film. There are humorous lines and situations, but they honestly come about through character interaction.What I did not like about THUNDERBOLTS: There are a couple of issues with this film, and they are not minor ones. First of all, the action scenes are nothing special, far too heavy on clumsy digitalized effects. This is a real missed opportunity, for a great action set-piece can do wonders for a routine film, and take a really good one and kick it into the stratosphere, such as the elevator throw down in WINTER SOLDIER or the battle at the airport in CIVIL WAR. This is something that has become a real failing in the MCU of late. But a far bigger failing is the overall lackluster writing, which was evident in the recent CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD. This is another Marvel entry where the script felt like a cut and paste job, never more so than in the third act, as when this ragtag group of \"Thunderbolts,\" who describe themselves as people who \"punch and shoot,\" have to take on an insanely over-powered opponent, one who can destroy them with but a flick of their wrist. The solution, same as it was in BRAVE NEW WORLD, where normal human Sam Wilson had to face the Red Hulk, was to have the heroes talk their antagonist down in a scene that is the equivalent of a therapy session. I'm sure some of these story decisions were producer mandated, the idea being to give the heroes the biggest and baddest challenge to entice an audience. But this just doesn't work for me, as I want to see a finale where super heroes go toe to toe with a super villain and give us a knock down and drag out to remember. That is what makes a great super hero film for me. Why couldn't they have had the Thunderbolts go up against a renegade arm of Hydra, or maybe AIM (Advanced Idea Mechanics), criminal groups that could easily have been inserted into the story; how about the son of the Red Skull, trying to finish his father's vendetta against the surviving super soldiers. That would have worked for me.All in all, THUNDERBOLTS is a decent entry into the MCU canon, one that has promise, but falls far short of returning the franchise to its ENDGAME era glory. It has been described as a \"hang out\" film, a movie that rides along because the characters are good company, and that might be the best way to sum it up. There is a mid credit scene, and a post credit one, the latter raising some interesting possibilities about where these characters go next as THE NEW AVENGERS, and an interesting clue concerning the next entry in the franchise, THE FANTASTIC FOUR, one I'm not sure I'm happy with."

The screenwriters seem to want to talk about everything, but in the end, explain nothing clearly.

If we really have to compare, we can only say it's better than Captain America 4... As for the final 'New Avengers' reveal - it just came out of nowhere, totally baffling.

Pretty much all the reviews for this movie are in agreement that Florence Pugh is a worthy successor to Scarlett Johansson. I also enjoyed David Harbour as the jovial Russian, the love-to-hate-him Captain America wannabe, and I have liked Bucky ever since the first Captain America. Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without introducing yet more supers. This time a ghost and (and briefly someone else). I also liked the fish out of water Bob, the unpredictable lab subject.In general adjustments made to the standard storytelling formula are successful. I think everybody also appreciates stakes set forth that are not the usual over-the-top threats. No floating cities or space monsters (yet). The fact that Yelena (Pugh) has no superpowers helps to ground her character. There is a thread that binds these characters, a fatalistic view of themselves. This darkness, usually applied to a single character (like the Dark Knight), is instead applied to most of the main characters. Kind of a group therapy session.The production has a summer blockbuster feel to it, with just enough action scenes to qualify. The political mumbo jumbo is a bit of a stumble. One of the most welcome decisions made was to have it clock in at 2 hours (not including credits and teasers). So no real missteps in a superhero movie released in the post superhero world.I give it 6 out of 10. Some points taken off for dull political scenes, and for the lingering superhero burnout."

There's genuine potential here, and at times, the film manages to stand on its own.The comedy hits the right balance - not overly forced like in some or most of the recent Marvel projects, but still present enough to keep the tone light and entertaining. This, combined with character that feel more likeable and fresh than what we've seen in recent projects like Captain America: Brave New World, makes Thunderbolts a more engaging watch overall.The narrative itself is also stronger and more compelling than in many of the latest MCU films. While not revolutionary, the story has clearer stakes, better pacing and a more grounded emotional thread that helps the movie stand out from the recent clutter of forgettable plots and bloated storytelling.The cast benefits from a stronger dynamic, and while no character reinvents the wheel, there's more heart and charisma in this group than what we've seen in a while. That said, many of the character still come acriss as re-skinned versions or wannabes of other heros - as if Marvel is hesitant to truly break away from its established archetypes.One of the film's main drawbacks is its inability to fully detach from the shadow of the Avengers. Marvel REALLY needs to move on from constantly trying to recreate or expand on the Avengers brand and instead focus on launching new heros and original stories, which they can do easily and properly."

The film offers a unique take on redemption and second chances, told through a team of morally complex characters who are as broken as they are powerful. From start to finish, it kept me engaged with a perfect balance of action, emotion, and dark humor.What stood out to me the most was the emotional depth. Unlike some superhero films that only scratch the surface, Thunderbolts dives into the inner struggles of each character. Their past mistakes aren't brushed aside - they're central to the story. This gave the film a more grounded, human feel, despite its explosive set pieces and larger-than-life battles.The performances were another highlight. Every actor brought something special to the table, from Florence Pugh's intensity to Sebastian Stan's quiet vulnerability. The chemistry between the team members felt genuine, with moments of tension, humor, and even warmth. It was fascinating to see how each character evolved throughout the film, especially as trust slowly built within the team.Visually, the film impresses with stylish action scenes and gritty cinematography that fits the tone perfectly. The pacing was solid too - it never dragged, and the stakes kept rising until a satisfying, emotional climax.Overall, Thunderbolts is more than just another Marvel movie. It's a bold character-driven story about learning to live with your past and finding purpose in unlikely places. Whether you're a longtime fan of the MCU or just looking for a deeper, more emotional superhero film, this one is absolutely worth watching."

Looking to protect herself by destroying evidence, she arranges for four of her dirty assassin's to be pitted against each other in a hidden base where they, and all the other physical evidence, will be blown up and destroyed. In the course of trying to avoid their elimination, these non-heroes encounter Bob, a likeable fellow with no memory. It seems that Bob may have been experimented upon.On the face of it, this shouldn't be one of the more successful Marvel movies. A group of second-division characters gleaned from assorted previous projects, jammed together at random in a fairly cookie-cutter plot? Marvel has had better ideas which have fallen flat on their face.But this one does something which Marvel hasn't done that often. It gives us emotional depth. The obvious case is Yelena and Alexei: they have a fractious present-day relationship atop the genuine parent-child relationship they had as sleeper agents in Ohio, and they are finally forced to face it.But Bob's issues, and how to deal with them, become key to resolving the story, as a result of which the action finale becomes as much metaphorical as literal, an interesting change of pace. We also get something addressed quite often in comics, not so much on the big screen, namely: What do you do when a Superman-level character goes rogue?This is a good superhero movie. What makes it a good movie - I'd go so far as to say a very good movie - is that there is a lot of depth to it. It digs right into the characters, it doesn't simply require them to fight."

Meanwhile, the supporting cast like David Harbour and Wyatt Russell were also great and really funny.2) The film really benefits from being fairly stripped-back in comparison to other recent MCU films that have involved time travel and multiverses etc. This pleasantly surprised me and I think the film really benefits from having this more character focused plot. For example, there is a large portion of the film that simply takes place in Val's underground bunker with our main characters fighting both verbally and physically, which was probably my favourite section of the film.3) The film really worked for me on an emotional level. I really related to Yelena's feeling of loneliness despite being a successful worker, as well as to Bob's feeling of having a darker half within himself. I thought it was genuinely heartwarming seeing the team come together to save each other in the final act and I hope the MCU continues making films like this one going forward.NEGATIVES:1) Whilst it's not as prevalent as it has been in previous MCU films, this film still suffers from having serious moments that are ruined by someone making a quippy joke rather than taking the moment seriously.2) It bothers me that Val seemingly didn't know that Bob was in the vault where she sent Yelena to kill Ghost. It always bothers me when key plot points in films happen simply by accident or by a coincidence. In this case, Bob seemingly survives Val's experiments and ends up in that vault just by accident and with no explanation? I then hated how Bob only gets woken up by Walker accidentally pressing the button on his capsule during a fight.3) The ending did seem quite anticlimactic to me. I'm going to come across like a bit of a hypocrite because I said earlier that I liked the film being more stripped back, but it felt to me like Bob isn't Sentry or The Void anywhere near long enough in the film for either of these characters to really come across as a threat. He seems to be defeated as The Void far too quickly and the fact that he's defeated without any kind of action scene was a bit of a let down for me. Also in terms of anticlimactic endings, the post credits scenes were both pretty lame I thought."

          "content": "After years of stumbling through a failed attempt to explore the Multiverse with messy plots, no real meaning or ambition, and an overload of boring, underdeveloped new characters Marvel Studios finally gets it right with Thunderbolts. And it does so in a surprising way: not by trying to innovate, but by simply telling a good story.Thunderbolts is Marvel's best film in years because it finally understood something important: you don't always have to reinvent the wheel - you just need it to work. The story follows a familiar formula: a group of outcasts forced to team up against a threat that the Avengers can't handle.The dynamic between the main characters is the heart of the film. Unlike other team-based movies that struggle with too many characters and poor development, Thunderbolts gives everyone fair screen time. It's almost impossible to pick a favourite, because each team member has standout moments. Their chemistry feels real and adds weight to both the action and emotional scenes.The direction is great, the pacing is tight, and the two-hour runtime flies by - thanks to smooth editing that knows when to speed things up and when to slow down.The action scenes aren't groundbreaking, but they're well choreographed and visually strong. A special mention goes to the villain, The Sentinel, whose powers and look are inspired by the real shadows left behind by victims of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. It's one of the details that makes him one of Marvel's most complex villains to date.On top of the usual Marvel fun, the film also carries deeper themes: trauma, guilt, depression, and the struggle not to let the worst parts of ourselves take over. It's also about facing the past and the chance for redemption.Thunderbolts doesn't try to be revolutionary, and that's exactly why it works. It's a breath of fresh air in a universe that desperately needed focus again. It's what Eternals wanted to be but wasn't. More than anything, Thunderbolts proves that maybe we're not tired of superheroes... we're just tired of bad writing and overblown ambition."

The rag tag team of misfits overcoming a major threat was a great way to go.White Widow was the main character for the whole film but she plays well off of US Agent, Winter Soldier, Red Guardian and Ghost very well. The whole team played off of each other so well that I wanna see more of them work together.Sentry finally made his debut. He's exactly what I expected but also portrayed physical elements of a mental illness very well. You see the fear of his family, the failures of his life and the uncertainty of his powers. As someone who struggles with mental health, I was very happy.I wanna see more of the Thunderbolts. Guess I'll have to wait until Doomsday."

You can include Thunderbolts on that list.I've got an Icelandic nephew (a film critic) who summed it up best. \"It was like I was watching a long but decent pilot episode of a tv series.\" I agree with Tommy.Our heros in this film pretty much require that you've seen them in their previous films and TV debuts. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has graduated from years of credit cameos to the lead baddie; Valentine Allegra deFontaine. She courts an unlikely band of misfit heros to erase evidence of a science project gone wrong. She hopes to this will lead to the end of a congressional investigation and avoid a possible impeachment trial. (She is now the CIA director.)The set-up that brings the new (anti-hero) heros together is long... and along the way they meet a harmless civilian Named Bob.From here this movie becomes formulaic ...Bob is more than he seems... He survived Allegra's science project.Allegra wants him ...I've given enough of the plot away.No this is not Marvel's worst;I'm hoping July's Fantastic Four debut is a better effort."

Yelena was obviously the star, but Sentry definitely stole the show.A lot of people are saying that this is one of the best movies from MCU's Phase 5, and they are even comparing it to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I'll have to agree. It's action-packed, it has heart and depth, and it touches you and moves you.Stick around for the 2 post credits scenes. They're \"Fantastic\"."

The comedy is pretty hit-or-miss (especially in the first half). But David Harbour is hilarious as Red Guardian and easily steals the show whenever he shows up. The main theme about depression and creating meaning out of the thick fog of hopeless monotony and isolation was very poignant with Yelena and Bob's characters. Bucky appears late, but is used well. John Walker remains unlikable, but serves his purpose as the group's stick-in-the-mud. Ghost and especially Task Master felt underutilized. The climax is pretty exciting and has a tenderly symbolic resolution, even if the final status-changing epilogue is a bit questionable. But it was a fun film with some nice commentary about mental health and finding purpose."

I know a lot of people say it's just simply great but not like mind-blowing or anything, but I'm feeling way stronger on this film. I think it's easily the best movie after Endgame (yes even better than Guardians 3). It's poignant, emotional, action-packed, hilarious, and everything a modern MCU movie should be. There's so much I love about it.Firstly, the team dynamics are brilliant. The movie is very self-aware about how lame most of these characters are, and it uses it to its advantage. And not only that, but they also utilize their troubled pasts, which is arguably this movies greatest strength. Some of the most emotional and heavy scenes in the entire MCU are in the film. The entire thing has this shared sense of loneliness, lack of purpose, and even depression, making it one of the darkest Marvel movies. There's even underlining suicidal thoughts for one of the characters.Second, there's not MUCH action, but the action we get is spot-on. Yelena in particular has some phenomenal action sequences scattered throughout.And lastly, the third act is one of the best in MCU HISTORY. Sentry/Void is such a good villain and he's a really compelling character, and the whole last 30ish minutes remind me of the Mysterio sequences in Far From Home. Speaking of Far From Home, Spider-Man is back on fraud watch after what happens in this movie.Also the post-credit scene is really cool but a bit over-hypedSo yeah this movie rocks. Best movie after Endgame, hands down."

          "content": "Qualified. Although it's much better than \"Captain America: Brave New World\", there are still issues with the pacing in general. For example, an hour had already passed when the \"villain\" turned evil (even the old three-act structure would've been better). I've noticed that the characters in Marvel movies seem to speak relatively slowly?In terms of content, the logic is generally sound. The plot is predictable but that's okay. But the backstory of the Void, who was born out of loneliness and pain, is actually not as tragic as that of the other characters (except for Walker of course). Instead of focusing on the cliché American dilemma of \"nobody loves me\", I'd actually prefer to see another kind of cliché about loving one's family and fight for it haha.The concept of superheroes is based on the idea that the world needs heroes. But when heroes and villains keep emerging in an unpredictable order, this concept seems rather isolated. When Alexei was watching Soviet videos and reminiscing about the glorious days, he said that personal value comes from \"contributing to the country\", but what exactly does this contribution mean?Of course, this is Marvel. I don't expect them to clarify the meaning of value, nor do I expect every line about values to be carefully crafted. The fight scenes are okay. Also I'm glad to see many connections with previous movies. The post-credit scene hinting at the new Captain America (Falcon) almost made me think that \"Captain America: New World Order\" had some purpose. I'm looking forward to the next movie.Also, when Void bared his teeth, it kind of disrupted the intense atmosphere."

More emotions. It still has good message within. The void he feels, the hurt he's doing to himself by beating himself (self-hate) not helping him.

          "content": "When it comes to Thunderbolts, I thought it was a decent movie. It brings together nearly every super soldier we've seen in the MCU over the years - including the new Black Widows - and the way they were assembled was genuinely interesting.But then we get to Sentry. Now, I like Sentry as a character. He's incredibly powerful, and using him as the villain - especially with his alter ego, the Void, representing his darker side - was a smart move. It added an emotional weight to the story, which fit well since each Thunderbolt member is dealing with some form of trauma.However, the reason I gave the movie a 7 is because only the new Black Widow's trauma really got explored. We saw what she was afraid of and what darkness she was holding in. That was powerful - but if emotional trauma is going to be a theme, it shouldn't just focus on one person. The entire team should've had that moment.Another reason I gave it a 7 is Bucky. We've watched his character evolve - from the brainwashed Winter Soldier to someone seeking redemption. In Falcon and the Winter Soldier, he even received the title \"White Wolf\" from the Wakandans, symbolizing his growth beyond his past. But in Thunderbolts, that development feels ignored. They continue to refer to him as the Winter Soldier, despite everything he's overcome and the new path he's chosen. If anyone deserved to stand as an example of healing and transformation, it was him.Then there's the end-credits scene. We're told 14 months have passed, and now this team is mad at Sam Wilson for putting together a new Avengers squad. That doesn't add up. Bucky already knew Sam was doing this - they literally talked about it. Bucky was the one who encouraged Sam to take on the mantle of Captain America in the first place. So for him to suddenly turn his back on Sam over the name of the team? It makes no sense.What's more confusing is that throughout the movie, they were fine being called the Thunderbolts. So why get upset over not being named the Avengers now? If they really bonded as a team, the name shouldn't matter. The end-credits scene felt like unnecessary drama - conflict for the sake of conflict.And here's the other thing: Sam Wilson is the new Captain America. He has no super serum - he's just a man trying to do the right thing. Meanwhile, the ones mad at him? All lab experiments. That contrast could've been powerful. Instead, it feels like the film is undermining the idea that a regular human can be a hero. It's disappointing, and with everything going on in the real world, the way this was handled just felt off. I hope I'm wrong, and maybe it'll all make more sense when Secret Wars comes around.So in the end, I gave Thunderbolts a 7 out of 10. It was a good movie, and a solid way to close out Phase 5 of the MCU. I just wish we'd gotten more - especially a longer, more intense battle between the Thunderbolts and Sentry.That's all I've got. Thanks for reading, and have a good one."

It does provide a backdrop for her motivation to eliminate everything related to OXE, but it doesn't really need as much time and space as it was given in the early parts of film. We could have used that time to get flashbacks for characters like Ava, Bucky, and Red Guardian.But in all it is certainly a fantastic film and a much needed breath of air for the MCU."

The film doesn't do anything to show their differences (in fact the film tries to sell you the fact that they all the same). Given the rebrand at the end its a very bad look, compare them to The Avengers they're all different and they do even small moves together. Not to mention that no one would know if they did anything to help in the end. There's just not a lot of creativity Bucky uses the same method to take out the cars, even uses the same knife move on Sentry. Imagine making that first fight scene and then you get told were going to shoot it from above and then its going to be dark, you'd be pissed (can work look at john wick 4 fire breath scene). Few fights later again in the dark but now with added smoke (Yelena and walker fight separately). I think if this was a Yelena solo movie it could work and would be less disappointing."

If Marvel keeps putting out movies like this, they can take my money - I won't miss opening weekend again.That said, it's not quite on the level of classics like Infinity War. While I wouldn't necessarily watch Thunderbolts again, I still think it's a great one-time experience. It does a fantastic job building character arcs that feel earned and not rushed, which is something Marvel hasn't always gotten right lately.The deeper meaning behind the team and their growth made the film feel unique and fresh. To me, that's what makes a movie memorable - and I'm now more excited than ever for what's next in the MCU."

They are not invincible and certainly not as strong as some of the other super heroes, but they managed to pull it off just the same.Florence Pugh has been able, over the years and especially with this one, to put herself front and centre as the new star of MCU. David Harbour is hysterical as the embarrassing dad figure and Lewis Pullman shines as the multi-faceted Bob the Sentry.At the same time it is frustrating to see what Marvel should have done all along and put recognisable flaws and struggles with their main characters in a mainstream film. The Marvels completely cocked it up with Carole Danvers and the rest, as well as Ant-Man Quantumania.

Loved how all of them have their flaws and aren't considered real \"heroes\" at first glance. Glad they got rid of taskmaster because the character was very boring so I wasn't looking forward to seeing them in the movie anyway. The topic of mental health is not something we see with other heroes a lot like the original avengers. I think the thunderbolts were the only ones who would be able to help bob with his issues. I can't wait to see them in future projects and how they interact with the OG avengers."

I am cautiously optimistic the Marvel Cinematic Universe has corrected course and are now back on track."

Honestly, her forgetfulness might be the best directorial choice no one made. 4 stars for her memory lapse. Sequel idea: just forget the accent entirely. There are many people who speak multiple languages fluently without an accent, there's just no need for her character to have to force one so poorly."

This movie brought back that og marvel vibe to it that has me confidently able to say that marvel is back!!!! The story is arch is creative and new, yet alludes to past marvel movies such as the avengers. This all contributed to a seamless blend between old marvel and this new phase of marvel we are beginning to see. Leaving the theaters I felt so excited that marvel studio heads finally had some sense knocked into them, as people have begun to lose faith in marvel movies."

It was quick and simple didn't really need much of an explanation on his backstory. Because they explained it as the story progressed in a subtle yet comforting way to make you not overwhelmed with ideas thought out the whole movie just a really good movie in general and even better superhero movie taking on a fresh new step among the superhero universe that we haven't really taken before as a cinema fan I give it a 4 out of 5 and as a superhero / MCU fan I give it a 4.5 out of 5."

Potraying of emotions is really good and the whole way how they defeat him is better then conventional frendship is magic endings.Characters are very well used. Yelena,Bob, Walker and Red Guardian get very good characterzation and they each potray diffrent part of being depressed. Bucky doesn't get a lot of screen time but he is already a very fleshed out character. Ghost shoud have gotten more of her backstory and dealing with her part of depression. Taskmaster was very wasted for what we thought was a main character tho."

It's a deeply character-driven story that breathes new life into characters from previous installments-characters we may not have cared much about before, but who are now given depth and emotional complexity. As the narrative unfolds, we find ourselves genuinely resonating with them on a personal level.The dialogue is exceptionally well-crafted, with each line thoughtfully tailored to reflect the personality and inner world of each character. This not only enriches the storytelling but also gives us a more intimate understanding of who they are.For me, despite lack of extravagant scenes, Thunderbolts* is still an exceptional and touching movie because it explores a theme that every adult has either experienced or is currently facing. Its emotional weight and relatability make it more than just a movie-it becomes a mirror reflecting parts of our own lives."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is a mixed experience for me, because of the trailers and my expectations.My experience:\nI was told that this is on the same level as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and that it is one of the best MCU movies of phases 4 and 5. And in my opinion, that's not true. Or at least I enjoyed this less than the one mentioned before and a few others that have come out since Endgame. I saw the trailers several times in movie theaters and there was that A24 style one, that I rewatched many times, because it was just too good. In hindsight, I think the trailers showed too much. And after watching the film, I watched a lot of interviews and they released so many clips. Actually they released the best scene of the film. Why would you do that?Writing:\nSo that's part of why I think this film is very predictable. We all knew the taskmaster was going to die, most of us knew Bob would be the antagonist (alongside Valentina). There were few surprises, for example I thought Bucky wouldn't hesitate in the end to arrest Valentina. The themes are probably the best part of the film. Heavy, important and sometimes dark, but when it came to the physical reality; extremely cool. That room sequence is also heavy with the themes, but I know they used as much practicality as they could and it looked so good. The characters are also great, but for some reason I just don't really like Yelena. Florence Pugh with a Russian accent can't get laughs and basically emotions out of me. On the other hand, the Red Guardian is my favourite from this film. His scenes are pure gold. I think Walker and Ghost were used very well, while every scene with Bucky is a treasure. Sentry is a good and intriguing villain, I hope he'll be a great ally to the Avengerz.Technical aspects:\nThe technicalities are great, but less amazing than I expected. Again, thanks to the marketing team. The cinematography is mainly good, but the lighting could've been better. The visual effects are great and grounded. The sets are quite diverse and the room sequence is quite inventive. The cast is amazing and the acting performances are outstanding for a comic book film. The directing is also really good with a consistent tone and pacing.Thunderbolts* is well-made, but I wasn't able to enjoy it, because I almost always knew what was going to happen. I still can't decide between 7 or 8 out of 10, so that might change."

Dare I say they're better characters than the Black Widow herself? Guardians 3 gave me the suspicion Marvel was doing better one-off villains and though The Marvels challenges this belief, my suspicion was proven here. Sentry is a wonderful villain and I'm excited to see his future in the Marvel universe. This was by far the shortest two hours of my life, but I suppose that's a good thing? I do wish we spent more time in the void, and focusing on Bucky, but I think we got a pretty fair dosage of all characters here. One thing i do fear is that Sebastian Stan will quit Marvel, similarly to Jeremy Renner, because he's one of the cast members who's been around the longest. Rather than just plain falling buildings and the lot, they came up with a cooler, more menacing way for the villain to kill people, and a great way for some \"punching and shooting\" people to kill him."

I saw it in the IMAX since it was filmed in IMAX. I'm so happy that Marvel is filming their films in IMAX now.This film was terrific. It had a phenomenal story, superb action, and great pacing. I love the fact that one of the film's main themes was mental illness, which is relatable to basically every human on earth in some kind of way. This theme is the reason that my original rating of four stars went up to four and a half.Florence Pugh was incredible once again as Yelena Belova. She definitely gave one of the best acting performances in the whole MCU. Marvel did an amazing job casting her for this character.Sebastian Stan was excellent as always as Bucky Barnes. Since Captain America The Winter Soldier he's definitely become one of my favourite actors because of this role and as a result he's made Bucky one of my favourite Marvel characters. He's 100% one of the best castings in the MCU. He just plays the character so well and he's shown the character development incredibly well over the years.Lewis Pullman was fantastic as Robert Reynolds/Bob/Sentry/The Void. What a fantastic introduction for Lewis Pullman and Robert Reynolds as a character. He played the character incredibly well and delivered a wonderful performance. I would've loved to see Steven Yeun play the character just because I love him so much as an actor and voice actor, but Lewis was 100% the next best option. It's so funny that has played a character named Bob twice now in two big films, this film and Top Gun Maverick. It's even funnier that both introductions of the characters were similar.I'm so glad that Jake Schreier tried to shoot this film as practically as possible, and you can definitely tell. The action scenes looked incredible, the stunt scenes were amazing (especially the one at the beginning which Florence did herself), and the CGI scenes still looked terrific. It just shows why it's always better to shoot films practically, which is why Christopher Nolan is such a legendary director and why his films are all phenomenal, he is the king of practical cinema.Overall, this was a terrific film and an immensely enjoyable watch. I'll definitely be seeing it again, maybe even two more times.\"So none of us can fly? We all just punch and shoot?\"Yelena Belova."

The literal definition of one step forward, two back..Well finally Marvel have bought out back to back to back films that range from good to great.

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is a 2025 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the team Thunderbolts. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 36th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU). The film was directed by Jake Schreier from a screenplay by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, and stars an ensemble cast featuring Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Pierce, David Harbour, Hannah John-Kamen, and Julia Louis-DreyfusThunderbolts brings together a ragtag team of antiheroes and misfits under the leadership of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), now the CIA Director and MCU's answer to Nick Fury. The team Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), and others are assembled for a covert mission that quickly spirals out of control. They discover they've been set up and must battle not only external threats but also the unstable Sentry (Lewis Pullman), whose split personality, the Void, threatens to destroy everything. The film climaxes with the Thunderbolts confronting their own traumas and insecurities in a desperate bid to save Manhattan from the Void's chaos, ultimately emerging as the world's new heroes-albeit with darkness still lurking beneath the surfaceFlorence Pugh delivers a charismatic and emotionally resonant performance as Yelena, anchoring the film with both humor and depth. Sebastian Stan brings gravitas to Bucky Barnes, especially in action sequences that remind viewers of his Winter Soldier roots. David Harbour excels as Red Guardian, balancing comic relief with genuine heart, making his character endearing despite his flaws. Lewis Pullman stands out as Bob/Sentry, effectively portraying a man torn between invincibility and vulnerability, making the mental health themes hit home.Director Jake Schreier revitalizes the MCU formula by focusing on character-driven storytelling rather than pure spectacle. The film's tone balances humor, action, and darker psychological moments, reminiscent of Marvel's earlier successes but with a fresh, more mature perspective. Cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo's work is notable, using stark visuals and inventive action choreography to highlight the characters' isolation and emotional statesThe action sequences are a highlight, blending practical choreography with top-notch VFX. Marvel was failed in few movies but they did well in this one Notable moments include Bucky's motorcycle chase and the team's battle against Sentry in Val's Watchtower. The action is impactful because it's rooted in the characters' personal stakes, making each fight more meaningful .The introduction of Sentry's powers is particularly impressive and avoids the rushed CGI feel of some recent Marvel entries.This time marvel went to address issue like Mental Health and Trauma The film stands out for its surprisingly introspective approach, exploring depression, self-doubt, and the psychological toll of heroism. Sentry's internal struggle with the Void serves as a metaphor for battling inner demons, while the rest of the team confronts their own feelings of inadequacy and impostor syndrome Redemption and Teamwork Like classic team-up stories, Thunderbolts focuses on broken individuals learning to trust and rely on each other, finding strength in their shared vulnerabilitiesPower and Responsibility The dangers of unstable power are highlighted through Sentry's arc, echoing past MCU explorations of the consequences of unchecked abilitiesThunderbolts is a welcome return to form for the MCU, combining humor, heart, and action with a willingness to tackle deeper themes. It stands out for its bold approach to mental health and its fresh take on the superhero genre. It's easily one of the most solid and engaging outings in recent years, offering hope for the franchise's future."

Would go see it agian. I enjoyed how it all came together as well. The music score is even really good. You definitely get some laughs as well, which adds to why I gave 10 stars. The plot was fantastic as well. The graphics are amazing as well. There are extra scenes so don't miss them. Don't want to give spoilers."

I figured this one would be another forgettable installment, and honestly, the only reason I was there was Florence Pugh. If anyone could salvage whatever mess they'd thrown together, it was her.But to my surprise, I really liked it. Like, really liked it. It even hit me emotionally, which I did NOT see coming. The film tackled mental health in a way I wasn't expecting, reminding us that bottling everything up isn't the answer. Instead, it encouraged facing your struggles, surrounding yourself with people who truly care, and letting them lift you up when you need it most.Of course, it wasn't all serious. David Harbour brought the humor with his signature one liners, making sure things stayed fun. What I thought would be just another MCU letdown turned into something that actually stuck with me. Maybe, just maybe, the franchise still has some surprises left."

The letter \"Z\" has become a symbol of aggression, destruction, and war crimes - it's plastered on tanks, rockets, and propaganda posters justifying violence against civilians. Using it in a blockbuster title feels either ignorant or disturbingly indifferent.They should rethink the branding or publicly clarify the choice, because right now it sends the wrong message."

The film shoves in a token message about mental health without delivering any genuine emotion or memorable character growth. Instead of developing complex, engaging personalities, we get faceless figures forced into recycled superhero tropes. The humor is painful-forced and out of place-and the shaky-cam antics leave the action muddled and even nauseating. The narrative is a derivative mess that clings to a worn-out formula, relying on a jumble of CGI setpieces and lazy dialogue rather than crafting a thoughtful story. With a plot that feels more like a cash grab than a genuine effort at reinvention, Thunderbolts proves to be a disappointing extension of an overplayed franchise. Rather than challenging its audience or innovating, the film panders to tired conventions, delivering a cinematic experience that insults discerning viewers who crave real substance over recycled spectacle."

It's ultimately their theme park experience - rides that give you the same experience every time- turned into movies. That's absolutely not what I want when I pay admission to a movie theatre.I had hoped Thunderbolt would be more creative. I thought it would be funny. But it's the exact same movie as any other Marvel movie. They even repeat the same shots. It's irritating and it's boring. I actually dozed off for some 20 minutes of the movie because I was so bored. And it's not funny at all. If anything, a notch depressive. But you care so little about the characters that ultimately their depression doesn't really matter much either.Why 4 stars then? Honestly, they invested money and sometimes it shows. The special effects are okay. I don't know. Maybe overrated."

This is what I came to expect from a comic book-turned-movie: the Chris Reeve-style dynamic hues on the big screen, to make me feel like I had stepped into an actual comic book. With Thunderbolts that's all gone. Everyone just seems dreary, depressed, broken, devoid of personality and visually drained of any color saturation. Other than one villain character seen briefly in the film everyone just looks so muted and dull. I barely know who any of these characters are, but then again I mostly fell away from watching the Marvel movies following Endgame. What was telling to me was the U S Agent character, who looks like a despondent, dreary Captain America. Gone is the cheerful, colorful and hopefully optimistic Chris Evans hero and instead it's just bleak and broken characters like this one. Maybe that's just what Marvel movies have become but that's not what I want to go and see. I want cinema of hopeful, optimistic escape, not dreary nihilism. As far as positives go, some of the action scenes were enjoyable but felt like they ended far too quickly. The music was bland and the film just left me feeling empty."

It is not offensively bad or anything grand, it is just a movie. It falls into a lot of classic Marvel tropes, becoming too generic for its own self, yet having the potential to elevate itself but sadly never did it. We are left with an all-around passable movie that feels like it is thrown in here for contractually reasons more than anything.A group of misfit assassins are hired to kill each other but most now work together to fight the person who hired them all to kill each other.The biggest problem here is that this movie sadly underutilizes a lot of its great cast. We are finally given time to really appreciate a lot of the Marvel characters with less screentime and give them more urgency to be in the future of Marvel. Sadly the main characters here all feel and act the same, they seem like copy paste personalities and that makes the movie feel rather flat and the potential to let differences crash not really be here at all. Ghost, Yelena and Walker all seem on the same wavelength of obnouxi and that is only interfered with the introduction of Bob. If you wanted a Bucky movie you are not getting it here as he seems even more unnecessary to the plot and is just here. The only highlight to me was David Harbour as The Red Guardian, actually brining some energy and humour to a movie that has just left me with a lot of assholes. There is also a huge disrespect of another character I hoped this movie would flesh out but really just said \"no\" to and to me that seems like such a waste of a character.This movies villains are overall interesting and the final villain is to me the best part. The overall concept and execution of that villain is cool, but Marvel really needed to tread lightly with the more or less mentioning of mental illness. Because this movie had some really cool and interesting themes overall, but they are just not utilized enough for me to really care. It´s about trauma and mental struggles and if the movie had made that it´s overall vocal point it would stand so much stronger to me. It is sadly drowned in time wasting and mediocre to bad humour and a plot that feels like it is barely moving at times.But the ending got me with a great performance from Lewis Pullman and a beautiful message that as mentioned, should have been the core of this movie to being with. But emotions are here and I think the core of the movie is good.I just don´t have much to say as it feels like a rather uneventful movie other than the last part of it. It is just a bit uninspiring to hate or like a lot of its aspects as the movie is for the most just fine on those levels and it becomes another movie in the pile of \"I have watched that\" more than a movie that feels like it had some sort of impact."

The other character was Bob/Sentry. He is probably going to be my new favorite superhero moving forward due to his humor, innocence, and has an emotional depth in his character. Sentry being my most favorite Superhero in the comics and for them to make him perfect and also better than they did in the comics was refreshing. Other characters like John walker who I really love as he is one of the best written MCU characters we have gotten ever."

I really loved the way they showed how the past can haunt you, and how people really feel when they're alone and filled with regret. As a Christian i feel that way a lot at times. And the way they showed the sentry was exactly how the enemy makes you feel like what he was saying. The only problem i had with the movie, which may not be a problem for others but for other Christian marvel fan like me this is a small warning to the other Christians going to see this movie. They say gd twice, Jesus once and Jc two or three times. It's pretty unnecessary to say the Lord's name in vain. So whenever it comes out on disney i'll just mute it at those specific parts. But if your faith isn't shaken by curse words like me then i think you will enjoy this movie! But i still don't like how they said it, but it didn't rlly ruin the movie for me, i looked past that."

If you've seen the trailers, you have seen the movie.It has a theme around depression, but only in the most U rated superficial and shallow way that a Marvel movie can. Pixar has dealt with the subject of feelings in WAY more depth and nuance, the depression shown in the film is just a very superficial plot device that is giving the antagonist some motivation and backstory, nothing more. The ending is extremely underwhelming.The good points are that it is well constructed (even though it is the standard basic Marvel plot) the CGI is mostly very good and the actors all try their best with what they have.It is better than a lot of Marvels recent failings so theres that."

It felt like a return to the kind of Marvel movies that made so many of us fans in the first place-before things got overly bloated or relied too much on forced humor, CGI and shallow cameos.The characters in this film are what really shine. They're all flawed, scarred, and in many ways broken, but that's exactly why you want to root for them. The story explores not just their powers, but their fears, regrets, anger, and ultimately, their hope. It's not just about saving the world-it's about saving themselves and learning to lean on each other.The plot was fresh, clever, and carried real emotional weight without ever feeling melodramatic. It balanced intense action with just the right amount of humor-nothing felt forced or out of place. And when the team finally comes together, it actually means something. You feel the payoff.The action scenes were gritty and had real stakes. It wasn't just CGI for the sake of CGI. Every fight felt personal and tied into the characters' journeys.In short, this movie reminded me of why the MCU was once so great and why it can be great again. No over-the-top gimmicks. No spoon-fed fan service. Just a powerful story, great characters, and a solid mix of emotion, action, and heart."

Also there is a seemingly normal civilian called Bob (Lewis Pullman).

The Thunderbolts*, are a grumpy, dirty group of troubled and far from superhuman heroes all with personal issues - as Yelana points out we fight and shoot, none of us can fly. As you'd expect the action sequences are impressive, but what works the best is the enjoyable characters with Florence Pugh effortlessly leading the way, Lewis Pullman as the mysterious Bob and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the cartoon like villain, the best of the bunch.

Thunderbolts* was consistently throwing its characters into action, and the audience along with it, and was a constant entertainer for me. The emotional depth within this film was incredible, truly diving into the mental health issues, especially with Bob and Yelena. The dynamic between the characters was some of the best I'd seen in a Marvel film, filling the void left behind by the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. I feel that a 7.7 rating which the film is currently sitting at is criminal, and needs to be hitting at least an 8.1 for the incredible piece of cinema that I have just witnessed."

Each member has good chemistry with one another and all bring something unique to the table. The standouts for me are definitely Florence Pugh's Yelena and Lewis Pullman's Bob. The latter especially standing out as the emotional core of the film that even moved me. Been a long time since an MCU product did that. Of course, David Harbour is a blast as always and the rest of the cast are great.What allows this film to stand out from the rest of the MCU is the thematic core. It presents real issues around mental health, loneliness and isolation dressed with a superhero aesthetic. It's the first MCU project in a while that feels like it has something to say rather than just another product to further the brand.Finally, the VFX and action are all pretty solid. While I wouldn't call it the best the MCU has to offer, a lot of it is helped by having investment in the characters. There are also a great deal of unique angles and shot compositions which feels almost like a lost art for the MCU. Even the soundtrack felt alive.Overall, Thunderbolts feels like a movie from phase 1 or 2 of the MCU where it feels like the filmmakers were making a movie first and a product second. It's a breath of fresh air and a all-around great time."

          "content": "I was pleasantly surprised. I went into the movie expecting a gritty, painfully stupid action flick and came out with something that was honestly compelling and a little bit heartbreaking.Without spoiling anything, there were two characters who were completely wasted and contributed nothing at all to the story, and there were a couple moments where the plot dragged a bit.Still, this movie deals with some heavy topics, like depression, loneliness, and serious mental illness. And instead of making a mockery out of any of those things, it handles them with grace in a way few of the Marvel films do.The performances were great, and while the villain might seem to some to be a bit \"cheesy,\" I look at it more as an allegory. If you take everything literally, you're going to struggle. If you see the symbolism and the intent behind it and relate to it, you'll love this film. Plus, I think it's fair to say the action and fight choreography was a step up from a lot of what we've been seeing out of Marvel recently.Thunderbolts* reminds me of a children's cartoon in the best way: taking heavy topics and making it understandable, digestible, and handling it in a way that even a child can relate to and accept.And I can't wait to watch it again."

          "content": "Numerical ratings aside, the acid test of any movie, really, is to ask yourself \"Would I like to see this again?\" For Thunderbolts* -- yes, I would. Definitely. For Captain America Brave New World just released a few months ago -- not particularly. That's really it in a nutshell. The production values are similar, but TBolts puts across a level of heart and commitment that has been missing from the MCU for a while now. And there's depth to it (see below) that I see is generating a lot of serious discussion among pro reviewers, which hasn't happened to MCU films in a while.The backstories of almost all the main characters are drawn from a bunch of previous Marvel movies and streaming series including Black Widow, Ant-Man and The Wasp, Falcon and Winter Soldier, and Hawkeye. So that's quite a lot of homework. But it turns out not to matter too much, because TBolts stands by itself pretty well. There's a fairly intricate but coherent plot, about the right amount of action/combat, but especially strong character development for two or three of the major characters.Lots of people have commented on how good Florence Pugh is as the Black Widow assasin Yelena, and I'll completely agree. We find her in a pretty dark place when the story starts. After years of doing solo black-ops jobs with lots of fighting and killing, she's lost, lonely, motiveless, achingly unhappy. But the script doesn't give us the true depth of this right off the bat; it develops as we go and finally finds its full impact (on both her and the plot) toward the end. She's the emotional center of the story and Pugh totally carries it off. And I thought it was effective that she was willing to look weatherbeaten and grundgy throughout the whole film, which nicely externalized her internal state. On the surface, there's nothing in the plot or the action that sets TBolts apart from other Marvel outings, but it shows how really great acting can lift all that material to a different level.But there are good performances all around, and the dialog and scene construction are a well designed mix of suspense, serious talk, and gentle humor. For the other characters, I've liked Hannah John-Kamen (\"Ghost\") since her role in Ant-Man and The Wasp and am delighted she's back -- she's a little underused here, but she has definite screen presence and cool superpowers not duplicated by anyone else. Sebastian Stan and David Harbour are good as always, and Lewis Pullman as the mysterious \"Bob\" is great. His storyline is a close second to Yelena's for its prominence in the plot (my wife, who's not necessarily a fan of these movies, liked Bob a lot.). Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as a CIA director playing her own behind-the-scenes games portrays the true villain in the show, a manipulative, nasty mastermind. Her character is unfortunately kind of one-dimensional and at times it was just annoying. That's the only false note I can really mention.Among different themes running through the whole story, the one that sticks with you at the end is how damaged, flawed people (which everyone in this new team is) can heal each other where normal society could not. The way to get past the Void inside you is not to keep it suppressed (as Yelena has tried to do) but share it with others. Pain shared is pain understood and lessened. Not a bad message to find in a superhero movie. One of my friends who's a health professional says that the way Thunderbolts* shows, and deals with, mental and psychological illness, is on the mark.The pacing, the action, and the camerawork are all the usual Marvel good work. There are inventive touches too. The 'fanfare' that opens all the MCU movies starts off nice and brisk and perky as always, but gradually goes dark and grinds to a halt, cleverly signalling the mood of the upcoming story. The opening scene where Yelena paraglides off an immensely tall building would be a highlight of amy Tom Cruise flick, but here it's used just as a cute throwaway. The final battle setting (in New York of course, did you need to ask??) uses innovative camera angles from both above and below that lift it above the routine approach. And the end credits cleverly use variants on classic artwork to show 'what happened next' to the team. Bottom line is, go see it!"

          "content": "Where to start? First off, the team chemistry is NON existent, but this was meant to be the case! Seeming as they're just thrown into this mess which introduces them to each other, sure, but unlike The Suicide Squad, they fail to make you care for these characters, the writers emotional depth goes as deep as it's cool quips and sarcasm which keep it afloat in the shallow end, which is fine to ease the tension, but it acts as an extinguisher to the eternal flame, also known as trauma - the over casting shadow to each one of these characters, and the contradicting pedestal to the underlying theme of this film, a delicate topic of mental health - more on this.Yelena and Red Guardian are the reforming, yet still wildly dtysfunctioning father-daughter duo, yet Yelena's past in the film, and what we find out in Black Widow, is beyond forgivable, but it's OK because her ol'man is a lovable, vodka drinking, regular old Homer Simpson who's self absorbed with his glory days and gave you up to be a brainwashed slave assassin, at least he didn't have to listen to her playing that stupid saxophone growing up... Yelena lets out how distraught her past is to the man mentioning how he essentially ruined your life and he comforts her, not by taking responsibility, but by muttering \"Those were dark times...\" (even if he had no real power and little to no say in the situation, he was the one that betrayed her, directly contributing to her innocence being taken from her, meanwhile telling nostalgic tales from the little childhood she barely had, as if he genuinely saw her as his own daughter, this is gaslighting on a whole other level and shows how broken of a man he is).Yet Yelena reaches out to him, seeking solace from the one person she should want nothing to do with, it does an exceptional job at showing how fragmented and alone she really is. Despite being freed from her dark past, she continues to dabble into merciless mercenary work because she has found no higher purpose in this world and is very understandably depressed, and, so it seems, suicidal, presented in the opening scene of this movie, she only does what she does best, killing, because thats the only thing she knows and she really doesn't mind if her next mission is her last. Other characters really subpar in their sorrow compared to her...Except, maybe, Task Master... Antonia, a young girl who witnesses her father's horrific actions, but when Natasha (Black Widow) tries to stop Dreykov, Antonia is caught in an explosion meant to kill Dreykov. She survives but is left severely injured. Her injuries lead to her transformation into Taskmaster, as Dreykov uses a combination of cybernetic enhancements and mind control to turn her into a weapon that can mimic the fighting styles of any opponent, THIS character, in spite of being a failed unliked adaptation of the comic book character, a character whose entire backstory revolves around trauma, manipulation, and identity loss had the potential to fit right into this group of delinquents. Instead of exploring any of that and giving her a rightful road to redemption arc, the film relegates her to a mute enforcer role with all the emotional depth of a mannequin. For a movie that parades around themes of redemption, justice and mental health, this isn't just ironic, it's the pot calling the kettle black, smashing it in a fit of rage for not being up to marvel fanboy standards, writing the script in permanent ink and forgetting you're meant to be giving a positive message towards the end of the film, hoping no one saw and asks why she continued a life of silent obedient assassin work just like Yelena, if anyone would have sympathy for this devil, it would've been Yelena who shares a most similar past, as they were both victims of the red room, but instantly she's treated like a joke as her body gets looted by the other characters before being swiftly cremated, and all she has to say is, \"Come on guys, don't loot her corpse\" or something along those lines, I get why people wouldn't really care about this as the majority never liked this gender swapped task master in the first place and I'm sure marvel has multiversal plans for the \"real\" Task Master.. but still, a redemption arc for this character was lost at the cost of contradicting itself and either simply getting rid of the character, or for shock value, as Ghost casually shoots her in the face, execution style.Speaking of who... Ghost is back! But you wouldn't know it because she's treated like a ghost in the plot too.John Walker sticks out like a sore thumb, and walks around like a giant middle finger, coping and seething through his forced teamwork therapy and clenching his jaw like it told him he doesn't deserve Captain Americas mighty shield. He's somehow more depressed than the chicken mascot backstory we're about to get into, as we explore his guilt in the film, we find out he's an asshole at home to his family too, doom scrolling hate articles on himself while his baby is waiting to be picked up, maybe he's pissed cus he's thinking he should get a DNA test on that baby in the crib.Bucky, bless him, he's just there. For some reason, what was it again? He's hovering in the background like someone who forgot their lines at their 8 year old nativity play and stayed silent. He's got nothing to do and even less to say, except occasionally stare into the void like he's wondering why he don't just join Captain Americas avengers by the time it's the post credit scene. He's the team's reluctant dad-bro, but mostly he's just vibing through the awkwardness. Now appointed as the most famous face hanging out with an old Soviet Union hero by Val, sure, why not.Bob / Sentry shows up embodying his sad, sign-flipping, meth-addicted chicken mascot past which is the personification of the deep scenes followed quips plaguing this movie. His delusions of grandeur with his jittery energy and blank stares, which leads to the void as an allegory to Carl Jung's \"shadow self\"as if we haven't seen a thousand of those already. The Void is just his repressed inner trauma, how original. There's nothing new about this movie, the actions good and especially in the scenes regarding sentry, though it's just nothing new and I sound like a spoilt brat spitting his dummy out even saying that, but not as much as Sentry's power trip ego moment, and then one minute he's tormenting innocent bystanders, sending them into the shadow realm, the next he's getting talked down like a toddler who's had too much sugar. Two times in a row this has been the case in marvel films, big baddie getting talked down.I get he's unstable like that in the comics but Sentry could've been Marvel's Watchmen moment. Instead, he's just Bob. At least the chicken made a clever metaphor for the type of person he is.And what's the emotional payoff? A half-baked therapy session from characters who barely know him let alone each other, followed by a scene that implies \"Yay! Bob's fixed now!\" as if trauma can be resolved in a 3-minute vision quest.The pacing is somehow both too fast and mind-numbingly slow.The Thunderbolts themselves are framed as a bold new direction, but really, rather than just a red herring, they're a grey herring: dull, flavorless, despite being a room of psychopaths. Task Master would've fit right in to the film and they had no right to put on her on the posters if she wasn't there to be discarded like a rejected rag doll. It's like Marvel tried to mix up their own Suicide Squad cocktail but forgot the main ingredients, and the alcohol. What we're left with is a mocktail of a murky plot and undercooked characters, it's like mixing oil with water, and just as colourful yet less fun to watch.Okay I exaggerate a little for emphasis, it's not the worst marvel film of all time and I might even rewatch it to see a different point of view, it's certainly a sight for sore eyes and is visually captivating. I just found it boring and didn't know what to expect, I know not to listen to critics but I really don't know what they found so good about this film."

          "content": "Going into Thunderbolts, my expectations were low. Marvel's recent output had been uneven, and I wasn't sure how a film centered on a group of anti-heroes would land. But to my surprise, Thunderbolts didn't just meet expectations-it shattered them.From the very start, the film grabs you with gritty tone, sharp dialogue, and a cast that brings raw depth to some of the MCU's most overlooked characters. Rather than relying on flashy CGI or endless fan service, Thunderbolts leans into storytelling, character development, and emotional stakes that feel refreshingly grounded.What truly sets this film apart is how it balances action with vulnerability. Each character-damaged, complex, and morally gray-gets their moment to shine. The chemistry among the team is electric, making their dynamic both tense and captivating. And the final act? Easily one of the best climaxes Marvel has delivered in years.Thunderbolts is a bold, edgy, and surprisingly heartfelt entry that proves Marvel still has the power to innovate. It may just be one of the best films the studio has ever made."

Cheers to good B2B partnerships that create a synergistic experience for the end user, a quantum reality movie fan!That being said, the content of the film was so entertaining that I want to see it again. The plot wasn't that complicated, but the characters made it a richly unearthing experience of genuine, comedic moments placed in extraordinary circumstances that illustrated the next level thoughts, values, and challenges for a new story to gracefully emerge. That each character in Thunderbolts becomes a unique and clever cog in a greater matrix of the Marvel universe gives this movie a memorable quality that all viewers can appreciate by watching more. I decided to stick around for the sneak peak into the next sequel of this phase in the Marvel journey."

The film follows a team of unlikely heroes - Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Taskmaster, and John Walker - who are forced to work together against a powerful threat.What sets this film apart is its focus on the human side of these characters, exploring their inner struggles and emotional conflicts. Florence Pugh delivers a standout performance as Yelena, bringing nuance and complexity to her role. The visual portrayal of The Sentry's dark side - inspired by the Hiroshima bombing - adds a haunting and memorable tone to the movie.Financially, Thunderbolts had a strong global opening, earning $162 million worldwide in its first weekend, including $76 million in the U. S. and Canada. On Rotten Tomatoes, it received 88% from critics and 94% from audiences, making it one of the highest-rated recent Marvel films.Overall, Thunderbolts is a must-watch for fans seeking a mix of intense action, emotional storytelling, and top-tier performances."

          "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed Thunderbolts-it was a refreshing and emotionally resonant entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While it might not follow the typical MCU formula, that's precisely what made it stand out to me. This film brought a level of emotional depth and character development that's been missing from several recent Marvel entries. It didn't rely on flashy gimmicks, overdone humor, or an excessive number of cameos to keep the audience engaged. Instead, Thunderbolts chose to lean into vulnerability, trauma, and the idea of redemption, giving us something that felt far more sincere and grounded.The ensemble cast did an excellent job portraying flawed, morally gray characters-each one bringing a unique perspective and emotional baggage to the table. These aren't your standard superheroes, and that's the beauty of it. The film explored themes of identity, guilt, second chances, and what it really means to be a team when none of its members are \"ideal\" or even trustworthy at first glance. Watching these individuals come together-often reluctantly-was both compelling and surprisingly heartfelt.What struck me most was how the movie didn't shy away from quiet, reflective moments. The script allowed space for silence, grief, and introspection, which added a sense of realism often missing in action-heavy superhero flicks. When action sequences did occur, they felt earned and served the story, rather than existing just to show off effects or stunt choreography. That said, the fight scenes were still engaging, well-paced, and visually striking without feeling bloated or overwhelming.Visually, the tone of the movie was also a departure from the overly polished, often too-colorful aesthetic of some other MCU properties. Thunderbolts had a more grounded, gritty look that matched its darker themes. The cinematography supported the story in a way that enhanced its emotional core-everything from lighting to camera angles felt intentional, emphasizing the loneliness, chaos, and eventual camaraderie of the team.One of the highlights for me was how the film handled character arcs. It didn't try to redeem every character in a predictable, overly optimistic way. Some made progress, some regressed, and others were left in a kind of emotional limbo-which felt authentic. Life isn't neat and tidy, and neither are these characters. That honesty gave Thunderbolts an edge that I deeply appreciated.The dialogue, too, struck a good balance. It had moments of levity and wit, but without becoming quippy to the point of undermining the emotional stakes-something Marvel has struggled with in the past. Here, when characters were in pain or facing moral dilemmas, the script allowed that weight to be felt, without cutting it off with a joke every five seconds.I also appreciate that the movie didn't try to set up five different spin-offs or overwhelm the audience with Easter eggs. There were connections to the larger MCU, of course, but they felt subtle and organic, not forced. Thunderbolts works as a standalone story, which makes it accessible for both long-time fans and newcomers alike.All in all, I truly hope Marvel continues in this direction. If Thunderbolts is any indication of what's to come, then the MCU might be entering a more mature and emotionally resonant phase. I'm excited to see these characters again, and more importantly, I'm hopeful that Marvel is rediscovering the power of good storytelling over."

          "content": "I saw this one in 3D at a Regal theater just now.Overall, I found the film watchable. The action is solid at times. The visuals are nice; I like the costumes and such. The best character in the movie is easily David Harbour's Red Guardian (i.e. The guy with the long beard): I think all of the movie's successful comedy comes from him. Florence Pugh makes a serviceable lead, and I found Wyatt Russell as John Walker to be okay too. Bucky is alright, but he doesn't get much to do. He doesn't do anything particularly memorableSome critics have claimed that this movie is the best Marvel superhero movie in several years . In truth, I feel that this movie still has the feel of \"we're covering the same ol' ground.\" There have just been too many superhero movies made. Unless a new superhero movie does something strikingly different, then a cloud of staleness appears on the screen, which happens at times in this film .... the conclusion is predictable (I would've guessed this ending just from the previews). Some of the explosions, car-flips, and other spots feel repetitive after all we've seen over the years. One plot thread involving the villain Valentina and the mysterious Bob echoes some scenes with Homelander and Stan Edgar in The BoysThe movie has an ensemble cast, but clearly, Florence Pugh gets the leading role as the primary protagonist, which is okay. But some of the other characters get lost in the shuffle. The Thunderbolts group, for example, has a member named Ava Starr who can pass through objects - her character is basically an afterthought in this film. I have little sense about her history or personality after seeing this film. The movie includes a subplot involving congressional hearings against the villain Valentina. During those parts, Wendell Pierce gets a lot of screen-time as the prosecuting congressman. But he just abruptly vanishes midway through, never to be seen again . The scenes with Valentina and her assistant are unfunny and dull.But most of all - my biggest issue with the film is that I didn't like the character Bob, who becomes a major piece of the film. The actor who plays this role, whether intentionally or not, looks and acts like a Tom Holland knockoff. His character isn't funny, charming, or likable. His character arc that occurs at the end (which I won't spoil) is unsatisfying and predictable6.5/10."

The theme of mental health was really good. The movie was so funny all around but it is also serious when it needs to be and does not end with a punchline. The movie is has a good story and acting. It does do a good job like Brave new world on filling in the audience that on what they missed. The only complaint is sometimes the CGI is wonky but very good looking. The post credit scene 1 is funny but number 2 is insane. Stay till the end of the end of the movie. So go watch it."

One that acknowledges imperfections and uses them to make the movie better whether it was comically or just to make the story more believable.

I love Bucky so that's prob what drew my attention and the whole widdow assassins. This was very good and full of action with some fun along the way. Yes the underlying theme is mental illness but it's didn't overpower the film. We all suffer from the kicks and punches of life. I love an anti hero and I love the broken captain America. The thing is if you're broken you can be fixed and this does it well with all the characters. I'm not sure how they will fit into the goody goodiness of the Avengers world but I will definitely be watching the next instalement. One minor issue the girl who was killed early on, I think they did a miservice but it didn't spoil anything."

Great actress and she did a great job in her role.The dialogue had the right mix of emotion and humor. The action scenes were awesome! Enjoyed each one and the movie just kept me fully engaged.

Also brilliant performance from Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, and David Harbour.They all did such a brilliant job making this movie! I think there's some Marvel films in the MCU that's good and enjoyable, and there are some that are a little let down, and went pretty bad, but for Thunderbolts*, this is so much fun and better that Captain America 4, if I have to be honest 😅 But still... pretty good Marvel Movie!9/10*."

Due to all good reviews for this movie I expected it to connect a lot of bs from New York but it's focus is not on that. They could've at least added a punisher grafiti on the walls of buildings or mentioning that Fisk is mayor. I'm not a hater so yeah I can agree that the part that they connected is cool but like people hype it too much. End credits scene is like cool and we get some sauce but I expected it to be more like Avengers 1 where they show Thanos. Would reccomend yes, go watch it but watch it carefully and not so hyped up."

What spoke volumes to me however, was the message that was being shared when it came to mental health in each of the characters. During the movie, there was a scene between Yelena and the Red Guardian that had me in tears, thinking about how important it is to be there for someone who is isolated both physically and mentally. We also see this with Sentry and Yelena durning the movie; one of my favourites being towards the later part of the film. Moreover, the movie was great, this is definitely a top 3 MCU movie for me for sure, and I'm stoked for future projects such as the F4."

          "content": "Conclusion first: Thunderbolts* has a lot of goods, but those exact goods constitute its bads. I love that Marvel finally allows characters instead of the script to take lead of the story. Except for a few explanatory monologues, the dialogues are mostly natural and entertaining repartee that's reminiscent of GotG or Age of Ultron from Phase 2. All actors are thoroughly on board --- except de Fontaine and her assistant --- and I love the squad's atmosphere of exhausted, exploited employees. Florence Pugh absolutely nails the portrayal of depression, as her highlight of spontaneous but suppressed confession cuts even deeper than a total meltdown. And Lewis Pullman --- what a cast! He's the perfect blend of unreadable, forlorn, self-loathing, menacing, but also appearing normal to seek validation, as Bob/Void basically steals the latter half of the movie. Speaking of which, drawing inspiration from the atomic shadow to manifest Void's ability is just brilliant.My main complaint is that Thunderbolts* is no longer what I'd categorize as a Marvel superhero movie --- it's more like an A24 action-comedy mix. The character-driven plots are more of a cover-up of how barren the essential story is --- from the Vault to New York and that's it --- especially the entire line with de Fontaine and Congress, which is a joke and insult to real-life politics. While Pugh and Pullman's performances are amazing, they basically monopolize the last hour of the film and leave the rest of the squad as background boards to preach the power of friendship --- a pretty cliche and simple message despite the flamboyance. Lastly, I'm a bit confused by the ending because how do mercenary criminals with histories of addictions and mental illnesses deserve the title of Avengers? Also, I said I love Bob/Void but does he actually look as powerful as a million exploding suns as the Sentry in the end?Given how Thunderbolts* crushed Captain America 4 in review, maybe this is the future of superhero films. Although I feel reserved, I do appreciate Feige and Gunn for trying to continue entertaining and surprising the audience."

          "content": "By Ian Chandler - May 4, 2025Thunderbolts* is among the countless movies in the never ending MCU franchise. Despite the latest offerings usually providing tired formulas, uninspired screenplays, and underdeveloped visuals, Thunderbolts* proves that the MCU can still catch lightning in a bottle. The threat is street-level, the heroes are vulnerable, and the characters are engaging. It may be early to say, but this might be the best MCU project since Captain America: Civil War! The reason it soars that high is because the film mostly stays focused.The best aspect Thunderbolts* offers is its group of \"heroes\". Much like the Guardians of the Galaxy, the team is dysfunctional, sometimes irrational, and each one has an ulterior motive throughout their adventure. But, unlike the Guardians, the Thunderbolts are all human characters, making each one more relatable than, say, a talking raccoon or an enormous tree. The film, however, has a lot of similar story beats you'd find in any movie about teamwork. Even so, Thunderbolts* remains to be a mostly fresh superhero picture. The script does not do the work alone, as the cast bring just the right amount of energy for their respective characters. Florence Pugh and Lewis Pullman keep the story grounded when the plot demands a more serious outlook. David Harbour and his character are simply delightful; every other line he says will give out at least a chuckle. Wyatt Russell, Sebastian Stan, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus also do well with their roles. However, Olga Kurylenko and Hannah John-Kamen are somewhat wasted; the script doesn't do much with these two.The plot, surprisingly, contains some depth too! It doesn't rely on forced fan-service like Avengers: Endgame or rely on a TV show like Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. It focuses on some psychological elements and doesn't sugar coat the ugly parts either. I actually cared about the consequences each decision led to as well as those who were in peril. I didn't even have those feelings for Avengers: Endgame. The difference from the other films is that Thunderbolts* is a little more careful with its story. Don't expect a narrative that can compete with an Oscar winning drama, but enjoy that we got something other than a blend of half-baked jokes and alien punching.The overall tone this film has is indecisive. The tone shifts every 10-15 minutes. The problem is that, even though the two primary moods are great, they appear to fight for the spotlight. Sometimes it is the typical MCU romp, filled with humor, superhero action, and quirky scenarios. On other occasions, the film is dark, and I really must emphasize that it does get rather bleak. So, when one scene has Harbour say something really funny and then another sequence highlights mature subject matter, the conflict is very noticeable. It isn't as jarring as the tone change in last week's The Accountant 2; with that said, it is still an issue and it's my only initial criticism with this film.So, Thunderbolts* is a great entry among the disappointing run Marvel Studios has had since 2019. The plot is above average, the characters are worth investing in, and it rejuvenates interest in the 17-year-old film franchise that currently has no end in sight. It is worth going out to the theater for this one as opposed to waiting for it on streaming. If they can keep this momentum with the upcoming Fantastic Four movie, we might have reason to care about the MCU again. I sincerely hope this is a return to form instead of a rare strike of success.Score: 84/100Summary: Thunderbolts* is electrifyingly good for a Phase Five MCU film. Despite some tonal issues, it shows that Marvel Studios is still capable of recapturing its much-needed magic."

The anticipation surrounding a particular character is quickly shattered when they're given only 5 to 10 minutes of screen time before being abruptly killed off. It was a heartbreaking moment that left me stunned.Valentina's plotline-centered around her desperate attempt to destroy incriminating evidence to avoid impeachment-felt underdeveloped, despite its high stakes. Yelena delivers a standout performance, commanding every scene she's in. Her interactions with U. S. Agent, Ghost, Taskmaster, Red Guardian, Bob, and Bucky set the stage for something huge.However, tragedy strikes when one of these heroes is suddenly killed, and another shockingly turns into a powerful villain. Bob's mysterious past adds an eerie tension, ultimately leaving the team of anti-heroes vulnerable and lost.But just when all hope seems gone, a stunning twist flips the story on its head-setting the stage for an explosive beginning to Phase 6 of the MCU. It's thrilling, yes, but the emotional highs are often undercut by a sense of missed opportunity."

They masterfully created warm, endearing characters the viewers really cared about, even Wyatt Russell's cranky John Walker, and Lewis Pullman's triple portrayal of Sentry, Bob & The Void was an astonishing tour de force. May I add that most parents are happy if their children decide to follow them into their professions, and the current silly fashion for sneering about \"nepo babies\" is like sneering at farmer's sons who want to be farmers!The cinematography, fight scenes and costumes were excellent, and the jokes were really funny, though I was a bit disappointed by the musical score.The heart-wrenching final battle between Bob & the Void was a slow-motion masterpiece. There is actually another meaning of that noun \"Void\", not as a desolate blackness of space, but as an \"opening\", \"gap\", or \"portal\" between two spaces or worlds. In that interpretation, Sentry is a Captive Archangel struggling to remember his original mission: helping souls to leave their physical form behind as a mere shadow, in order to enter the portal to Heaven. Remember the way is very narrow, and there is a \"life review\". That's why he kept saying compassionately that he would \"help\" them. That's why he represents \"The Golden Guardian of Good\", and in that interpretation, he represents John the Baptist, whose non-identical twin brother Jesus is represented by John Walker, their father Yahweh is represented by the Red Guardian (Zuras/Zeus), and Yelena & Ghost (The Holy Ghost) represent two forms of The Holy Spirit. Remember who attacked them, bound them, and tricked them into helping him stop the Archangel Sentry from Rapturing any souls? He was named after the Stag, the antlered \"Buck\", and is now a replacement for Loki, part of the \"New Avengers\" team. Who does Bucky really represent, do you think?That is an alternative interpretation of this splendid movie, and I hope the team will keep \"The Thunderbolts\" name (as in Zuras/Zeus) instead of being forced back into the tired old trope of \"The New Avengers\" with identikit uniforms."

Kevin Feige has proven himself to be a master of storytelling; being able to intertwine the individual narratives of thirty plus characters, all of whom have such rich depth, and somehow making it all cohesive. It's a feat but he accomplished it, against all the odds and gave the world the Avengers.Here we have a hodge-podge team of galant anti-heroes battling depression. We haven't really seen a ton of focus on mental illness, at least not since Wanda created the hex to cope with her great losses, and of course let's not forget about Tony's severe PTSD. Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) leads the charge and she's coming at it from a place of deep loneliness and depression. Natasha has gone forever, and she doesn't feel that she's has a place in the world. She moves from job to job with minimal satisfaction, but maximum sass, but doesn't know how to stop herself from tumbling into the void.It's a compelling thematically narrative leap to make for a Marvel film, especially since people traditionally go to them for the lighthearted side of entertainment, and all the immersive action sequences. It feels really honest and sincere. Bucky is the one to give a stabilizing voice to the strong willed members of this new group.It makes for an exciting and highly entertaining film, so that has been a fresh new face amongst what has become lots of the save thing. We're ready for some new action and the Thunderbolts just might be that. We'll have to wait and see what the other Marvel projects of this year have to offer."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* offers a different perspective in the Marvel universe. There are several themes explored here, such as trauma, loneliness, redemption, and teamwork. In terms of concept, the story presented gives a different impression for a superhero film. The drama in this film not only discusses complicated politics, but also discusses other sides of the characters that make the film feel more emotional, but personally, even though it is a bit too cliché at the end, it does not ruin the emotions that have been built. For the action, although it is little, it is executed very solidly and excitingly. For the comedy inserts, although funny, they still feel inconsistent. The development of the characters is written neatly, and the deepening of the character's background is fairly successful in making us feel-in with them. The pacing may feel slow but is still acceptable. The cinematography is not like most superhero films, it feels more cinematic with a darker tone. The visual effects and CGI are very neat. The production and sound design are very solid. The scoring is more thunderous. The acting is also better, the chemistry is all there. Overall, an amazing closing film of MCU phase 5.I give this 8.9/10."

It really makes it more realistic to the viewers and the daily life of an average Joe.The fight sequences were amazing in this movie, a character John Walker which everyone hated from the series \"Captain America and The Winter Soldier\" really put his hate to test in this movie, now he is actually a favourite of mine. Bucky was awesome as he always is, the badass even though his life is messed up, he still goes through it, like a badass. The Red Guardian played by David Harbour was the funniest out of them all, he really gave the movie lots of comedic scenes and made it really fun and enjoyable. Yelena and Bob (aka: Sentry) were the most important characters in the movie they really shows even though they have done some bad things and have serious messed up childhood, they can fix it, not alone but together.The close up shots were amazing, wonderful work from the director Jake Schreier, it kind of implied that they were no longer wearing the mask to fit into society or to seem perfect, they were just being them and being them isn't exactly the best feeling, but they fought through it, together.This movie had lots of actions, comedy scenes and emotional scenes. And the end credit scene does give us some information on what happens in the upcoming Fantastic 4 movie. Overall, great movie, great acting, great actors."

Florence Pugh shines, giving us a more emotional and well-rounded look at Yelena, while the rest of the cast does a fantastic job of taking us along for the ride with their struggles and problems. David Harbour also gives us plenty of laughs and a few solid emotional connections.'Thunderbolts*' does have a pretty simple story overall, but it excels with a great look, good acting, and a ton of emotional pull. It dives into subject matter not touched on much in a Marvel film, which really helps set it apart.Brad: 8\nJosh: 8.5\nFinal: 8."

Whether you've seen these characters before, or remembered their backstory, doesn't matter: they're established as humans. Then it exceeds all but a couple of those projects in dramatic depth, with script, performance, and dialogue all hitting at least a B+ simultaneously. Best, it does this across almost all of the cast. There are some thudding moments critics can pick away at, but overall I guarantee it's better than what the cynics will sag. There's even one new new in the action-a moment of faux-relief where standard Avengeresque fare morphs directly into a frightening dark Thanos-level turn, and coming from an even sadder source."

          "content": "The biggest obstacle facing the bickering, misfit anti-heroes of Marvel's 'Thunderbolts' is viewer fatigue. A fresh take was needed and these aspiring would-be Avengers mostly succeed in putting a cap on the MCU's Phase Five, while laying at least some of the groundwork for Phase Six.The more casual movie-goer might wonder 'Who are these guys?' We already know Bucky Barnes/the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), who is now a freshman Congressman.Early in the film we see mercenary Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) casually complete a mission that requires her to beat up a couple dozen heavily-armed soldiers, jump off a skyscraper and blow up a couple of floors of that building. Ho-hum, all in a day's work.Yelena is recruited by shady Congresswoman Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (SEINFELD's Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) in what seems like a fairly simple mission: infiltrate a storage facility and destroy any files that might incriminate her.There, Yelena encounters the elusive soldier Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) and a wanna-be Captain America (Wyatt Russell). They duke it out WWE-style until they realize they've been lured into a trap and working together is the only way out.One quibble with the MCU is that with each film, the baddie has to be more powerful and a bigger threat than in the last film. That kinda happens here with the indestuctible, invincible Century - a kind of all-powerful being that toys with the heroes and flings them around without breaking a sweat.In general, the action sequences are good and the film is also pretty funny at times. Much of the humor is derived from the \"Replacement Cap\" and his malaprop-prone Russian counterpart the Red Guardian (David Harbour). These guys desperately want the respect an Avenger would get and if that includes a picture on a Wheaties box, they're ready to pose.Probably more than any other superhero film, 'Thunderbolts' tackles the theme of Mental Health and we get it early on when a character appears to be getting ready to jump off a building and the audience doesn't know if it's a suicide attempt. The scrappy heroes must each face their own personal baggage at some point to save the day.One doesn't have to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy 'Thunderbolts'; the film stands on its own, and viewership of prior Marvel films is not required.There are two end-credit bonus scenes, the second of which is quite substantial with a nod to the MCU's Phase Six. It got a big audience pop at the screening I attended."

It delivers some of the best fight scenes we've seen since the earlier days of the MCU, full of energy, creativity, and real stakes. What sets this film apart is that it doesn't rely on pointless cameos or future story setups to succeed; it stands strong on its own.The story feels accessible even to those who aren't hardcore MCU fans, thanks to its powerful exploration of depression, mental health, and abuse. It had me on the edge of my seat, shouting, laughing hard, and even crying at times.The dialogue is sharp, the humor actually lands (without the awkward cringe we've seen in some recent Marvel projects), and the emotional beats hit deep - especially for longtime fans. Visually, Thunderbolts* boasts a unique art style and stunning cinematography that make it stand out from the rest of the MCU.The dynamics between the characters are surprisingly natural and engaging, despite many of them just meeting. And yes, the post-credit scene is not just an afterthought - it's powerful, relevant, and sure to leave audiences buzzing.It's obvious Thunderbolts* was made with real care and love. In my view, it easily deserves a spot in the MCU's top 10 - if not the top 5."

And yet, it has elements that make it exciting and novel in its exploration of mental health. The D-word is the enemy here - the Void - the emptiness that we all face at points in our lives. This enemy personified - is powerful enough to trample and ensnare all. An enemy that one cannot punch their way out of. And discovering their way through this big bad is a broken team - each carrying their own closet of darkness.From the cast, Florence Pugh stands out playing the magnetic character of Yelena - the emotions she conveys in all her scenes carries the movie forward in the slow, early half. She raises the bar for the cast, and she is met halfway by Lewis Pullman. His performance as Bob is nuanced and precise. His role could have easily veered into snarky territory - easy to dismiss and mock - but he handles it so gently that it remains believable start to finish.Recommending this watch on the big screen."

          "content": "As a longtime Marvel fan, both from the comics and the cinematic universe, I walked into Thunderbolts with cautious optimism-and I was pleasantly surprised. Over the years, Marvel has had its fair share of hits and misses (unfortunately, more misses lately), but this film manages to get back to solid storytelling without forcing politics or ideologies into the mix.Now, is Thunderbolts the best Marvel movie ever? Not at all. Is it the worst? Far from it. It's simply a well-made film that delivers an engaging, character-driven experience. The heart of the movie revolves around the question: How does a ragtag bunch take on a Superman-like powerhouse? The character dynamics work, and while the humor is hit or miss, there were definitely moments that had our group laughing out loud.For fans who know who \"Bob\" is, there's an underlying tension whenever he's on screen, what is he going to do next? That feeling might not translate as strongly for casual viewers unfamiliar with his comic book origins, but it's definitely there for longtime readers.One standout aspect of Thunderbolts is its emotional depth. The movie leans into darker themes, exploring traumatic pasts and the complexities of the mind, and it does so in a way that feels earned rather than forced. It's a departure from the usual formula, but it works well within the context of the story.Of course, Thunderbolts isn't without its flaws. Some moments may not land as intended, the comedy doesn't always hit the mark, and there are some questionable CGI effects and plot points that could have been tightened up. That said, none of these issues take away from the overall enjoyment of the film, they're small enough to look past if you're there to simply have fun.At the end of the day, this isn't an Oscar-worthy drama, it's a blockbuster popcorn flick, and it embraces that wholeheartedly. Sometimes, you just need to sit back, enjoy the ride, and have fun with a movie that knows exactly what it is."

Is it the best movie since Endgame ? No, it's just beaten by GOTG 3 but it's close."

          "content": "Thunderbolts (2025), directed by Jake Schreier, is the last film of Phase Five. The film features an ensemble cast, including Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov, Wyatt Russell as John Walker, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr, Lewis Pullman as Bob (Sentry), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.The narrative begins with Yelena Belova undertaking a mission in Malaysia, setting a somber tone with intense action sequences and her introspective narration. This opening introduces the clandestine \"Sentry\" project. Subsequently, CIA Director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine assembles a team comprising Yelena, Ava Starr, John Walker, and Antonia Dreykov for a covert operation. Unbeknownst to them, they are pawns in a larger scheme, leading to a confrontation where Ava kills Antonia. The team discovers Bob, a survivor of the Sentry experiments, and learns of Valentina's betrayal. As events unfold, Bob's alter ego, the Void, threatens New York City, plunging it into darkness. The Thunderbolts must confront their past traumas to help Bob regain control and avert catastrophe.The performances are exceptional, with Florence Pugh delivering a nuanced portrayal of Yelena's internal struggles. David Harbour's depiction of Alexei provides both humor and depth, especially in scenes highlighting his dynamic with Yelena. Lewis Pullman's portrayal of Bob stands out, effectively conveying the character's mental turmoil and duality.While the film may not be action-heavy, its character-driven narrative and exploration of redemption and identity place it among Marvel's most compelling entries. The climactic revelation of the New Avengers evokes the same awe as Tony Stark's iconic \"I am Iron Man\" moment. Additionally, the Fantastic Four's cameo is a delightful surprise, hinting at exciting developments in the MCU's future.However, I was genuinely surprised and perplexed by the abrupt demise of Taskmaster (Antonia Dreykov).In summary, Thunderbolts stands as a bold and character-driven addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its emphasis on personal redemption and team dynamics offers a refreshing departure from traditional superhero narratives. Despite minor flaws, the film is a worthwhile watch for both longtime fans and newcomers."

          "content": "Core ImpressionsThunderbolts presents itself as a surprisingly elegant and emotionally resonant exploration of heroism through the lens of mental health. What I anticipated to be another formulaic ensemble entry in the MCU turned out to be a poignant, deeply reflective narrative that exceeded expectations on multiple fronts. Each cast member delivers with striking precision, contributing meaningfully to a story that feels both intimate and expansive. This is not merely a film for fans of the franchise - it's a cinematic experience that I would earnestly recommend to anyone who has ever contended with trauma in any form.CharactersWithout question, the character who captivated me most was Sentry - or rather, Bob. His portrayal of a superpowered being burdened by addiction and psychological torment was both haunting and enthralling. His descent, and eventual reckoning, forms the emotional nucleus of the film. His third-act arc is jaw-dropping, executed with a level of sincerity that elevates the entire narrative.Yelena, meanwhile, continues to be a masterclass in layered characterization. Her confrontation with her father - in which she lays bare the weight of her past - was gut-wrenching. It served as a raw meditation on the effects of PTSD, grounding the fantastical in something deeply human.Although every character served a narrative function, I did find Ghost - previously introduced in Ant-Man and the Wasp - to be notably underwritten. Her presence lacked clarity and emotional depth. Additionally, Bucky Barnes felt like a peripheral figure - more a checkbox for star presence than a fully realized participant in the story. Nevertheless, the group dynamic matured organically, and the camaraderie, once formed, felt earned rather than manufactured.StoryThe central narrative - assassins-turned-teammates - treads familiar ground, but it's the inclusion of Bob that infuses it with novelty and gravitas. His trajectory acts as a thematic catalyst, shifting the tone and deepening the emotional texture of the film.The tonal balancing act between humor and heaviness is handled deftly. Particularly in the second half, the film commits fully to its metaphorical commentary on mental illness - and it is here that it truly distinguishes itself.A standout moment occurs during Bob's origin sequence. The depiction of his substance abuse, intertwined with his psychological unraveling, borders on the horrific. There are echoes of The Boys in how Val's manipulation mirrors Homelander's fixation in Season 1 - yet it goes further, offering a vision of villainy rooted in psychological horror. The concept of reliving one's worst day - perpetually - is as imaginative as it is terrifying. I found myself frozen, caught in the same emotional spiral the film conjured.Visuals and DirectionAesthetically, the film aligns with the Marvel template - sleek and serviceable. However, its action choreography, reminiscent of The Winter Soldier, injects a level of kinetic realism that grounds the spectacle. The costume design, while not revolutionary, is effective and appropriate to each character's arc.The highlight in terms of visual spectacle is undoubtedly the introduction of Sentry's full power. It's a moment that feels like a cinematic overture to James Gunn's forthcoming Superman - visceral, awe-inspiring, and restrained just enough to maintain narrative coherence.Final ThoughtsIn the aftermath of Endgame, Marvel has struggled to recalibrate. Thunderbolts, however, feels like a genuine return to form - not through scale or nostalgia, but through substance. It reorients the franchise toward character-first storytelling, offering audiences not just another team-up, but a compelling reflection on psychological resilience and personal demons.Final Score: 7/10A formidable installment in the post-Endgame era, Thunderbolts lays a potent emotional and thematic foundation for the MCU's future - one steeped in vulnerability, humanity, and consequence."

The whole plot felt rushed, and I felt as if no effort was put into developing the characters to make you feel for them. It felt like a tragic attempt at creating an action-comedy, but it fell short and ended up just being a nothing movie. The worst part is, Sentry/Void is an amazing villain in the comics, and Marvel wasted what could have been an exceptional villain.About the actual screenplay/acting. The performances felt empty. None of the characters actually had a developed personality and all felt like cheesy-knockoffs of original marvel superheroes. Rather than trying to just recreate the old Avengers, I think they should have tried to develop a whole new line of unique characters, making them comic-accurate too."

          "content": "Overall, I would rate this movie a 6.8 out of 10, and I don't think that score will change much. It's a standard Marvel action film with a pretty straightforward plot. I'm glad they removed some characters that didn't add much to the story, like Taskmaster-hopefully, they bring back a more interesting version of that character in the future.I appreciated that the film took the time to give some background stories for the characters since not everyone is familiar with them. The balance of humor and action worked well, and I especially liked the character of Century. He was portrayed really well, and I could see how tricky it must be to showcase his powers, but they managed to do it effectively.On the downside, I don't think this movie needed to be shown in theaters; it would have been just fine on Disney+. I also feel like we didn't really need this movie at all-not that it was bad, but it doesn't significantly impact the larger Marvel universe. Plus, my favorite character, Bucky, felt underused and more like a background figure. I hope they introduce new characters to the team in future films.In summary, it's not a bad movie, but after seeing it once, I don't think I'd want to watch it again."

The Thunderbolts do not have great chemistry together, some were likeable, whereas others were just rude or plain. Their reasons for working together were thin at best and the whole thing just felt quite unsatisfying, especially the ending.There were a few funny moments but not a lot of banter between the characters themselves. The focus on mental health was nice to see and I liked a villain being a person's internal monologue but the group hug to save the day was a bit weird.Florence Pugh is once again great as Yelena and Sebastian Stan adds a bit of gravitas but most of the other characters could've just been benched to be honest.If they really have cancelled Young Marvels but kept this project going then it's safe to say the New Avengers will have absolutely nothing on the originals."

Almost like the director and writer said, \"You know what? Marvel's already done Avengers, so let's just take all the meat out of that one and just rehash it.\" This is the result.It's halfway decent, but nothing to write home about. A couple memorable scenes, but the Russian dad is annoying af, half the jokes feel forced, the \"team of antiheroes\" feels gimmicky and forced.All in all, an unnecessary movie that only adds to the pile of Marvel movies, where we have to ask ourselves, \"Did we really need this one?\"Not really. But it's watchable."

For the first time in a long time, I have been very pleasantly surprised.My two biggest gripes have been: 1. Lack of character development leaving me feeling disconnected and apathetic for protagonists and 2. Lack of connection to the larger narrative. So many post credit scenes left with no follow-up. So many movies with rushed dialogue and zero heart.That is not so with Thunderbolts! Aside from one of the main characters (Ghost), I walked away feeling invested in each of the characters' stories - especially John Walker and Yelena.The action scenes were sparse, but effective and very well shot.My teenage son said his biggest gripe was that it was \"too sentimental\", but he's a teenager and is just wrong :) The driving narrative that deals with hopelessness/isolation etc was relatable and drew me in.And the connection to the larger MCU has me so excited for what's to come.Marvel, don't screw this up! I want to look at you and \"not see your mistakes\" :)"

It is a fresh air, marking triumphant return to storytelling after years increasingly dealing with the multiverse saga. Where we can see the touch of A24 aspect in this movie from the story, cinematography, tone, and etc.From the start of the movie, Thunderbolts already give us a consistent visually engaging visual where A24 touch all over the screen entire films. By combining the A24 arthouse style with Marvel blockbuster movie, the visual in this movie is becoming more interesting.The story was quite simple, but it is sharp and bold with well written script. Rather than these past few marvels movie where they put quite complex story with multiverse on it but didn't really get into some certain point, where in those movies the story of complexity were not really work well, making them confuse where the story should go. Just put multiverse, meeting the characters, and give a fan service. By giving the A24 touch, this movie becomes minimalist in action, but the any action scenes in this film were bold and engaging.With strong characters background, this movie can bring us to a journey with a depressed anti-hero team into a fun ride, where sometimes the jokes are hit and miss for me. More thing that I like in this movie, where they use more practical effect rather than CGI, so it looks more real.Florence Pugh and Hannah John are stealing the show with their bold performance, fight, and all aspect from them, their light was more shining rather than the other casts. I love how Florence Pugh using those Russian accents it feels like it really suits her, from how the movie styled her in outfit and overall style, those accents become more suits her.The character development also really consistent, where from the movie start Bob didn't know who he truly is, until the end of the movie, where it gets more emotional. Not really happy with the ending, but it feels like it is the best way to end the antagonist in this movie because he's too powerful, where the CGI explosion, bold action are becoming more less and it more into emotional bonding, from its characters.Some of the questions about the movie is how Alexie know exactly Yelena is, in the middle of dessert. The lady who always snitch on Barnes, I don't really get the point in the toward ending scenes where the Thunderbolts came because she snitches her boss to them, but it is also her strategy to introduce new heroes, but maybe it is a part where I miss in the dialogue.Shoutout to the whole cast and crew of this films for giving the Marvels fans what they have been starving on with bold visual and storyline. I feel this movie is a solid 8, where I'm not a fan of the ending feels like a kid show ending, but again feels like the best way to conclude the films."

          "content": "Having read the New Avengers comics in the early 2000s more than once, this was a surprise I did not see coming. Knowing Sentry was part of the story had me from the start. From the books he has been an exceptional take on what it means to be a hero and what its like when someone fighting demons on the inside he handed absolute power. Thunderbolts brought that to the table and didn't shy down from it. This is the type of story telling that the MCU once did so well, telling real stories about people with real emotions, relationships, desires, trauma, and used the Super Hero genre to put those stories on stage.Every actor came to play, but it was more than that. They carried their roles with dignity and weight. Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan have earned the right to wear those suits, and they both delivered. But for me, the real surprises were Hannah John-Kamen and Wyatt Russell. I barely clocked them in earlier appearances, but this time, they owned their characters. Especially Russell. His U. S. Agent went from someone I loathed in Falcon and the Winter Soldier to someone I respected. He found the core of the character, brought a new confidence, and it worked.Julia Louis-Dreyfus was, of course, a force. She's always had the comedic timing, but in Valentina, she brings a sharper edge, commanding without overplaying it. She nailed this role from day one, and she's only gotten better.However my hat goes to Lewis Pullman as Sentry...Bob. Bringing this complex \"hero\" to the screen would require an actor who could portray a childlike innocence, let us all feel like a storm of sadness is building and pressing against the backside of his skin. And when that storm breaks, maintain some sense of self while letting the dark take over. And he did just that.The story itself was fresh and direct. It wasn't meandering or trying to be everything at once. It had focus. It had heart. It handled heavy topics-depression, addiction, isolation, anger-without getting preachy or bogged down. And in doing so, it reminded me of why I cared about these stories in the first place.When I would see trailers for this project I was hoping it would be good, because let's face it, the MCU has been drowning and as a true Marvel fan I have passed or missed some MCU projects because the writing and characterizations were just lifeless. This dared make me hope the heart of these stories is beating again. And if not, at least Thunderbolts took care of its characters and respected them.New Avengers Assemble."

Let's list all the sins this movie commits.#1 The movie starts out with the new Black Widow parachuting herself onto an enemy building in brought daylight where anyone could see her coming. I thought she was all about stealth.#2 She then proceeds to easily beat up a bunch of guys in the typical fashion that you see in any average action film. But for some reason she struggles with an old doctor who even manages to stab her with a knife. Guess he should have been working in security instead.#3 We are then introduced to the boss lady, de Fontaine, and she sure hates men. As a man you should make sure not to call her miss Fontaine or she will remind you how stupid a man you are. She also loves to promote women. That's right, she actually says this. She even calls Sentry a \"manboy\" just to show how strong she is. And she hasn't even met him at this point.#4 We are then introduced to most of the members of the Thunderbolts where they spend roughly 30 min. In a death cage fighting each other, mostly with words. I'm not kidding. Then the two female members gang up on poor Captain Crunch (I actually forgot his real name) because he had the unfortunate fate of being born a man, and he must be reminded how stupid he is throughout the entire film.#6 de Fontaine then spills all of her secret plan to kill the Thunderbolts in her limo where none other than Red Guardian is the driver. That's right. The father of the daughter that the boss lady plans to murder was sitting right there listening to the whole thing.#5 When they finally get out of the complex Sentry decides to potentially sacrifice his own life to save the team. Fortunately he has superpowers and is captured instead. But moments later he decides to turn on his friends because the boss lady tells him to even though she was the one who wanted him dead in the first place. Then moments later he turns on the boss lady cause he's now the boss man. Why didn't he do this before beating up the only people who cared enough about him to come to his rescue and risking their lives?#6 Sentry then becomes depression manifest and they all go to therapy and cures Sentry's depression with a big hug and some love. Sadly it didn't cure my depression from watching whatever this is.#7 Oh, and the Thunderbolts are not the Thunderbolts anymore. Disney, Uhm, I mean de Fontaine holds a last minute press conference where she introduces them as The New Avengers. Cause I guess Disney, Uhm, I mean de Fontaine is desperate to save what little is left of this franchise.#8 Oh, and the Fantastic Four show up in post credit cause Disney needs to remind you to buy more tickets soon to make up for the flop of this movie."

The design of sentry and the void was brillian the void being a very ominous figure in the sky and sentry looking like a true hero, this film also shows the true intetsions of valentina and how she'll do anything to be in power very well i only say this as this film has been being set up for a while with valentina recruiting her \"team\" this has been a movie long in the making and the wait was worth it, so as a whole I rate this film a 9 out of 10 being my favorite marvel film since endgame."

          "content": "I truly believe that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is back, at least for the next couple years. The latest is THUNDERBOLTS*, a movie about a rag-tag group of misfits who all have their own personal traumas. After being set-up, they decide to reluctantly band together to stop an overwhelming threat. If you're thinking this sounds a lot like Marvel's answer for DC's SUICIDE SQUAD, you're not alone. It's similar, but it eventually delves deeper than what we're used to, especially for a superhero movie. Despite this team being comprised of people from different past Marvel projects, it does a good job filling you in enough to not be lost. If you do want to do the homework, I'd recommend seeing BLACK WIDOW, THE FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER, and ANTMAN AND THE WASP. The team itself has Yelena (Florence Pugh), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), John Walker/U. S Agent (Wyatt Russel), Ava Starr/Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Antonia Dreykov/Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), and Bob (Lewis Pullman). Despite a couple characters being short-changed, the rest are fully fleshed out and have a great dynamic together. Harbour and Pugh are the highlight of the movie. Their father-daughter bond and performances are amazing. Bob is a great character, and Pullman pulls off a great performance as well. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a fun time stretching her VEEP muscles here as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, the director of the CIA embroiled in an impeachment trial. The humour meshes so well with the overall darker tone and themes of the movie. Themes of light and dark are folded into the cinematography. Explores mental health, which is something I didn't see coming from a Marvel movie. While the first half feels familiar, the second feels unique for Marvel. The writing blends humour with emotional moments really well. There's a moment where I literally gasped. The movie has a smaller scale, more focused on the characters guiding the story and not some world-ending CGI-fest, which might throw people off. It has a strong focus on mental health, trauma, guilt, and regret. It's refreshingly introspective. It has more going for it than just punching and shooting. THUNDERBOLTS* has a simple story wrapped in a complex character study of grief and trauma. A compelling, emotionally grounded group therapy session. This is a team that deserves to be on the Wheaties box, with the kiddie toy. You should know by now, to stay through the entire credits!

          "content": "In a franchise often criticized for relying on cameos and nostalgia, Thunderbolts is a refreshing exception. It stands out as perhaps the best-written Marvel film since Endgame, offering a tightly constructed narrative that's both emotionally resonant and thematically rich, where superhumans are also considered humans.The third act, in particular, lands with unexpected emotional weight-I found myself genuinely moved. What makes Thunderbolts so compelling is its refusal to fall back on fan service. Instead, it presents a script with purpose, heart, and a clear message that adds something meaningful to the broader universe.The action sequences are thrilling without being overindulgent, and the performances are consistently strong across the board. It warmed my heart to hear the cheers Bucky and Sebastian Stan got every time they entered the scene for some action. His being an emotional leader to the rest was such a lovely redemption arc. The rest of the cast also did a great job of expressing the low side of being a superhero. And Lewis Pullman as Bob is now on my radar - he has great acting potential.A sincere bravo to the creative team-Thunderbolts is a rare blend of spectacle and substance, and every minute feels intentional."

This film focused on mental health and using the character sentry or the void was a really good choice,it just felt right. I found this movie to be HIGHLY RELATABLE as it shows themes like loneliness,isolation and not being good enough. And it might just make you cry. Oh and the fight scenes and the choreography was amazing especially the one in the 3rd act even if the cgi feels a bit wonky. But my one problem with this movie would be that it mainly focuses on yelena and bob and sometimes the red guardian,maybe even John walker just a little bit . So that makes it feel like the other characters are left out. Even though they're not COMPLETELY left out,characters like Bucky,ghost feel like they're not even in the movie sometimes. And taskmaster was SEVERELY under-utilised. The jokes are pretty funny in this movie. And the movie doesn't end with the main characters having a big cgi fight, which was really refreshing to see. We found out what the asterisk means by the end of the movie. And there are two post credit scenes the first one is pretty funny but the second one is amazing. It really felt like the MCU was back again. Overall great movie definitely recommend."

But Thunderbolts shuts down all the rumor and create a hope among friends for their upcoming projects.Marvel always relied on heavy action and cozy stunts, but the way makers made this movie, the concept were unique and thoughtful.Before watching, i thought this movie will be typical one time action movie like the previous Captain Movie. But every character got their proper screentime and space. John Walker after lot of hatred on Falcon series, he got his star and touched our hearts. Yelena were always a rough character, but she has also a heart, Red Guardians comedy everything were perfectly executed. But i think Taskmaster also should have got her timing. Makers can explore her character a bit much more.The action scenes were very good, and the antagonist, Sentry/Void reflects his persona on us. The post credit scene was directly connected to the next movie, so it was worthy watching too.A feel good experience for all marvel fans."

However, my experience with the movie didn't quite live up to the hype.Starting with the plot, it was fairly straightforward, relying heavily on character development-and in that aspect, the film truly shines. It delivers some of the best character development I've seen in a superhero movie in a long time. The performances by the entire cast were excellent and felt like the perfect finishing touch.The action sequences were well-executed but limited, which is unusual for a superhero film, as they typically rely heavily on action. I didn't mind this, though, since the story didn't really call for more action.One of the film's weakest points, in my opinion, was that the trailers revealed too much, making the movie quite predictable. There were no real surprises left in the plot, especially since the story itself was simple with limited twists. It felt more like a setup to build the characters for future films rather than a standalone story.The villain was compelling and introduced as an extremely powerful force, but the film didn't fully explore the extent of his threat. Some moments in the climax felt underwhelming, as I didn't feel much tension or excitement.Overall, I found the movie to be pretty average. I appreciate Marvel experimenting and stepping away from their usual formula. The film touches on themes and ideas that haven't really been explored in superhero movies before, which was unexpected and refreshing-but there's definitely room for improvement."

          "content": "Unlike most of Marvel's recent output, 'Thunderbolts* (2025)' isn't just \"not bad\", \"perfectly fine\" or \"better than people say it is\", it's genuinely good. It's a movie that feels like a real movie, with real sets and costumes and characters and a story that doesn't seem like it's been subject to a million rewrites. It isn't based solely around gratuitous cameos or smothering links to promised sequels and forgotten prequels. It's actually about something, with themes and messages and characters who change and grow over time. It understands that spectacle should be driven by character, that a team's dynamic should shift and strengthen over time, that comedy shouldn't undercut drama, that stakes should be personal as well as world-ending, that set-pieces are more effective if they aren't focused around wave after wave of nameless thugs or CGI beams in the sky. It stumbles on occasion, it falls into some of the same pitfalls as its peers, its development is a tiny bit rushed and often spelled out for the least engaged in the crowd, but its successes are more important - and more impactful - than its failures. This is an entertaining, engaging and emotionally affecting experience that thrills, chills, tickles and delights. It's surprisingly dark at times without feeling edgy, and its sentimental subtext is presented sincerely enough to warm the heart without feeling mawkish. It's funny, but it never sacrifices its more serious elements; its tone is shockingly well balanced. Its performances are all pretty much spot on (especially those of Florence Pugh, Lewis Pullman and David Harbour), and its characters are actually quite interesting because they're notably different to their more traditionally heroic counterparts (some of them, for example, are jerks). Its themes of redemption ring true because of where these people end up compared to where they begin. The film believes in second chances and it doesn't take shortcuts with them. While the cinematography is a little dull overall, the picture has a distinct and tonally congruous aesthetic that's tangible and considered. It manages to blend the real with the imagined in a tactile way, naturally escalating from boots-on-the-ground semi-realism into all-out no-rules fantasy without betraying its core identity. Its CG elements aren't especially prevalent, but they're still suitably convincing. Although it's potentially lighter on action than you'd expect, the set-pieces are still really compelling and have a grounded vibe that makes them punchy and effective. There's some well-shot and well-choreographed hand-to-hand combat, which mostly makes good use of the (slightly) varying power sets of its fighters (Ghost has the most visually and conceptually interesting skill) and often makes unexpected yet satisfying choices - such as when a hallway fight is captured mostly with a single overhead shot that tracks Yelena as she casually takes on several armed foes simultaneously. There's also some more surrealist elements in the third act that escalate things without making them so far-fetched as to feel unrealistic within the established world. The not-exactly literal approach of the finale is really effective at communicating internal conflict externally, marrying character-focused introspection with expected superhero spectacle in a really engaging and exciting way. I love that the climax doesn't just come down to seeing who can punch the hardest, and the flick does an excellent job at conveying why this disparate bunch of anti-heroes are the perfect people to save the day this time (even after it spends a long time communicating that, at least on paper, they aren't \"save the day\" material). One disappointing sequence occurs within moments of the darker-than-usual Marvel Studios logo: Yelena sits atop the second-tallest building in the world, then leaps off and parachutes to a neighboring skyscraper. In and of itself, it's a nice moment. That disappointing thing about it is that it's shot in such a way that it isn't obvious, at all, that Florence Pugh actually performed the stunt herself. It's not just that we don't get any close-ups of her operating the parachute, which - to be fair - she might not have done herself, or that the stunt is so brief that it's over almost as soon as it begins, but rather that the shot of Pugh jumping off the building is too close to confidently see that she fell more than a few feet below frame. Ideally, the camera ought to have started close, then pulled back so we see her falling a long way before she slips out of frame and the rest of the stunt-doubled stuff can occur in a wide-shot. It's a small gripe but it occurs so close to the start that it took me a while to process it before I could settle back into the affair (it doesn't help that the piece starts with clunky narration telling us the internal struggle of our hero, which soon becomes apparent regardless). Another weakness is the way the film treats one of its deaths. If you've seen the movie you'll know exactly which one I'm talking about. I get that it's meant to increase the stakes by proving nobody is untouchable this time, but it's done so early and with so little consequence or reaction that it feels nonchalant rather than brave or distressing. It's blunt but not all that shocking, and I feel as though it should have been reserved for later when we've had some time to get to know the character in question - so would undeniably care more about their demise - and when it could be used to genuinely raise the stakes by proving just how out-of-depth the eponymous team is at the start of the final third. It kind of feels like Marvel didn't know what to do with the character and weren't comfortable having them roaming around somewhere in their off-screen universe, so decided just to unceremoniously kill them off as soon as possible. Still, it's not a major issue, more of an annoyance - or, more accurately, a missed opportunity. Another minor annoyance is the post-credits sting, which feels a lot more traditionally Marvel in the sense that it's a blatant advertisement for one of its upcoming projects. Event the pre-credits climax feels like an obligatory tie-in to the future, but it's less bothersome because it feels relatively earned within the actual narrative. There's just something really laboured about the studio's need to connect everything together, and the ending stands in stark contrast to the feature's refreshingly self-contained and cameo-less majority. It doesn't help that the marketing department have opted to go into full spoiler territory less than a week after the movie's release, proving that the studio is far more concerned with its individual pieces' place within a wider puzzle than it is in said pieces (a wider puzzle which, by the way, has yet to be properly defined). I could write a whole piece about how frustrating Marvel's insistence on spoiling their own material is, but I don't want to take my focus away from what's inarguably their best movie since 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)'. Thankfully, it doesn't directly impact the success of this feature. This is a fun, tonally balanced, well-paced, exciting, relatively affecting and consistently entertaining experience that's a lot better than the \"not bad\", \"perfectly fine\", \"better than people say it is\" 'Captain America: Brave New World (2025)'. It feels like a proper movie, which ought to be a low bar but surprisingly isn't these days. It isn't phenomenal, but it's pretty great and it's a lot more enjoyable than I was anticipating. You don't need to use an asterisk when you call it a good movie, and that's really refreshing. It's a good effort that actually makes me excited to see these characters return in the future."

It felt fresh in the best way.The cast is stacked, with mostly returning characters, but the standout for me was the newcomer: Bob, played by Lewis Pullman. He brought something different to the table and totally held his own among the established names. It was also great seeing Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, and David Harbour back in the MCU-all delivering strong performances.Even with so many familiar faces, THUNDERBOLTS* stands on its own. There's not a ton of crossover or setup for future projects, and honestly, that's exactly what the MCU needed right now-a movie that focuses on one story and tells it well. No homework required. If you have seen everything leading up to it, sure, it adds a little extra, but it's not necessary to enjoy what this movie is doing. It's cohesive, sharp, and doesn't try to do too much.The special effects are solid for the most part, with a few typical rough spots, but the amount of practical work really helps sell the world and the action. The humor is well-balanced too-just the right amount, and it feels natural, not forced.In the end, this is exactly the path the MCU needs to stay on. We need movies like this-connected to the bigger picture, but small-scale and self-contained. THUNDERBOLTS* delivered everything I wanted, and then some. I loved the story, the themes, and the characters, and I want to see more of this kind of MCU. Oh-and yes, the post-credits scene actually matters, and you know it's going to pay off.A must-watch for fans, and a great watch for anyone who just wants a good movie-proof the MCU can still hit hard when it dials things back and just tells a great story.

          "content": "Amid the rubble of what was once the most dominant pop culture phenomenon in cinema, \"Thunderbolts\" shows up as a genuine-if inconsistent-attempt to bring some sense of identity back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After a streak of forgettable, disjointed projects weighed down by their own mythology, this film directed by Jake Schreier brings something that's been missing from Marvel movies for a long time: characters who can stand on their own, not just as chess pieces in a giant corporate game.The premise, while not exactly groundbreaking, carries a layer of almost accidental meta-commentary: a bunch of B-list characters trying to prove their worth in a universe overflowing with heroes that have already had their moment. By putting figures like Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), and Red Guardian (David Harbour) under the command of the always-ambiguous Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), \"Thunderbolts\" plays with the idea of second-tier heroes-not just within the story, but in the eyes of the audience too. The fact that these are characters left over from other narratives actually works in the film's favor, letting it dig into their scars and moral messiness instead of trying to sell us yet another batch of flawless icons.It's a shame, then, that the first act insists on following such a by-the-numbers path. The narrative gears are all exposed, with clunky exposition, uninspired missions, and a grim tone that hides more than it reveals. The cinematography, while technically solid, traps the film in a desaturated palette that borders on visual monotony. It seems like an attempt to signal a more \"mature\" tone, but in practice it just reinforces the MCU's tired aesthetic-that same gray-and-brown fog that's been masking creative burnout for years. Schreier's direction also struggles with the action scenes early on: they lack urgency and flow, making it hard for the viewer to feel pulled in.But once the film finally gathers its main squad, there's a noticeable quality jump. The character dynamics start to breathe, revealing unexpected depth. Florence Pugh once again proves she's the real deal as Yelena, exploring grief and disillusionment without turning her pain into cheap emotional bait. Lewis Pullman is a nice surprise, avoiding caricature and finding a grounded core in the mysterious Bob. David Harbour brings the right mix of charm and sarcasm as Red Guardian, managing to be the comic relief without clashing with the film's overall tone. And Wyatt Russell gives John Walker just the right balance of ego and guilt, making him more human than expected.Not everyone comes out on top, though. Ghost is still a severely underwritten character, and Hannah John-Kamen doesn't have much to work with beyond some stoic expressions and functional dialogue. Sebastian Stan, meanwhile, feels like he's just clocking in as Bucky Barnes, with a half-hearted performance that suggests even he knows this role peaked emotionally a while ago. The script also stumbles in how it reintroduces characters, often rushing through the process and assuming the audience has done its homework watching all the previous films and shows-a habit that's becoming more and more exhausting within this franchise.Still, the biggest win in \"Thunderbolts\" is its ability to land an emotionally coherent third act. Instead of going for yet another over-the-top CGI showdown, the film opts for a more restrained and melancholic finale. The internal conflict among the team, while not exactly shocking, is handled with a level of maturity that gives weight to the characters' choices. There's a sincere effort to shift the focus back to the human behind the mask-something the MCU had lost in its labyrinth of variants, portals, and overlapping timelines.Despite carrying many of the studio's recent bad habits-forced setups for future projects, overly polished tone, and the constant struggle to let a movie just be a movie-\"Thunderbolts\" stands out as one of the more cohesive and unexpectedly solid entries in this current phase. Not because it's bold or game-changing, but because it's functional, straightforward, and, at times, surprisingly heartfelt. It's not a grand comeback, nor a genre-defining milestone, but it does show that there's still room for what once made Marvel great: flawed characters, caught in messy situations, facing dilemmas that hit deeper than the sound of exploding CGI rubble.If the MCU really wants to survive the burnout of its own oversized ambition, maybe it needs to start caring more about its emotionally broken heroes-and let them reconnect the audience with what actually matters: not the powers, but the people behind them."

It needed more development of the subjects, more action scenes, and more scenes with the villain. It does leave a message of brotherhood and empathy, but it lacked development, not simply because of \"the power of friendship.\""

I came to the conclusion at the end that nostalgia and characters altimately beat the actual stories. Most movies felt bland, but thunderbolts felt more real and connected to the audience. The emotional depth in the film and compelling story that really left me in awe was a insanely good change from the endless violence in previous movies that exchanged a decent script and depth for fight scenes and CGI. Thunderbolts was real and the characters felt more relatable that we all make mistakes. The film makes a great dinamac between the cast instead of the Avengers which were a bore to watch together after seeing what the thunderbolts had achieved."

Fully originating from loss or failure. These characters are a train-wreck. And they're not pretending as they aren't.Thunderbolts is one of the first MCU films that makes me realize how dull and empty the avengers as a team really were at first, they weren't fully functioning in the majority of Age of Ultron because they needed to develop from co-workers to friends. They needed time, unless The Thunderbolts, they originate from an situation that forced them to work together, but a choice led them afterwards to do it again. They share these true human experiences, of guilt, suffering, loss, betrayal, they aren't careful with each other, because they don't know it another way.And I love this about them. These characters feel raw, real, and on the hill of them all is Bob. Sentry. His powers are not only a metaphor for his own struggle, but they reflect the whole team. He works perfectly in this film to get the theme across. And they way they've made him appear in the third act... the sound design was shaking my seat.I don't need to write much about the action, feels genuinely real, practical, you see what happens on screen every time. No wild cuts, no shaky cam, just raw and honest action. And the soundtracks just adds to the momentum of the scenery on top.This Is a very good film. If It wasn't for some corny jokes or rushed moments, It would've been even great. Plus, the Post Credit Scene hyped me up for what's to come. I'm all in for more of them."

Homework wise you got Black Widow, Falcon and Winter Soldier, & Antman and Wasp to watch. I liked some of these characters beforehand mostly Yelena & Red Guardian and yeah they are the emotional core of the movie. This movie is specifically Yelena's movie which I love Florence Pugh so I don't mind that. The rest of the cast gets some ok screen time. U. S. Agent had some ok character development but I thought he would get more. Ghost and Bucky are kinda just there. Red Guardian gets annoying most of the time except with his good emotional moments with Yelena. Bob was also great. The villains are good. The action sequences are shot great with no annoying jump cuts. In a way, the movie doesn't feel like the conventional MCU movie. Now it still has that Marvel humor at times and is the low point for me for the movie. There are a lot of scenes where it is just constant bad jokes with no great punchlines. The finale is a little different from your stereotypical MCU finales and I like that. It also has one of the most productive end credits scenes that definitely help better paint the picture for Doomsday a bit. Overall this is one of the better MCU movies in a while."

Florence Pugh carries the movie on her shoulders, finally a story set around her and a group of characters we have barely seen besides Bucky. I liked Walker in Falcon and Winter Soldier but he shines in this, he's not only hilarious but a well developed character as is the whole team. Ghost besides still being herself still has more development in the movie. Taskmaster was useless. Even David Harbor was hilarious, he's just so full of light throughout the whole movie and genuinely cares about Yelena as well as you can tell he's having so much fun. But man Bob kinda carried the whole movie for me. Lewis Pullman was a historical from the second he came on screen, then he became Sentry and wow, while the suit took a second to used too but he was awesome. I really like how the Void Sentry he was scary. The movie was absolutely stunning to look at, from the first shot of Florence jumping off the second tallest building to the amazing car chase in the desert. It was all stunning with mostly peaceful effects for the obvious stuff, and some really good looking CGI. I do have some issues. One is definitely the new name at the end of the movie though I did like how they connected it with the MCU it felt like a solo story with some hints of the future. But the new name disappointed me but I guess it will have some conflict idk. Also why did marvel spoil the post credit scene in the credits which was dumb. But man I really liked this movie, great characters, great action, beautiful cinematography and I highly recommend it."

          "content": "Outside of my own personal feelings about the franchise in which this movie exists, Thunderbolts* is simply... not that good, from a narrative perspective. And it's disappointing.Let me be clear: I was not expecting Thunderbolts* to be an absolute masterpiece. But I also wasn't expecting it to feel like it did: a distractible, incomplete story that scoffs at itself outside of a few moments of clarity where it reveals the ghost of its own potential. When the movie ended, I felt like I had been robbed of a good 20 minutes of additional material that would finish wrapping up the story, if there even was a proper one. Evidently this is meant to be a lead-up to Doomsday, but my goodness, why make a movie with a half-baked story that retcons the emotional conclusion of at least one pre-existing story in the franchise, and leaves the peripheral characters unceremoniously de-clawed? Are we meant to be excited that these two \"new Avengers\" groups are going to be in conflict by the time the Fantastic Four ship arrives?This movie felt like 2 different stories abruptly switching spots in the spotlight. And in doing so, both stories are compromised and emotionally undercut. On the one hand, we have a wacky heist spy-thriller with undercurrents of political intrigue which had the potential to flesh out into a physical and philosophical horror story. With that potential, the next story is unsteadily connected to the first; a commentary on mental health, community, isolation, and personal redemption. Except the redemption isn't really earned for the character that needs it the most-instead, he gets a group hug and is allowed to continue to separate the darkest part of himself, and the horrors it commits, from the rest of him and continue going along as a... mascot? Team pet? He isn't even included in the team properly.I'll stop beating around the bush. If you've watched the movie, you know I'm talking about Bob. Oh, Bob. I remember (perhaps naively) wondering in the first act of the film what would happen to make him completely turn into the biggest physical threat of the film, as portrayed in the marketing. My heart broke at the many potential explanations in my mind for his turn of character. And then his turn actually came and it was all I could do to keep my eyes from doing a full 360° inside my skull. His character is arguably the most delicate, given his in-universe background as a survivor of DV, an addict, and someone very clearly suffering from at least 2 distinct mental illnesses. He does not have the same self-referential ability that Walker, Ghost, or Yelena have, because he's only just been introduced fully in this film.So, what do they do with poor Bob? They take away his agency until the very last act, wave off his objectively horrific actions as \"not him,\" and treat him as a cute little pet that the rest of the group apparently ends up caring for. He ends up feeling like, and pardon my bluntness, a wet rag of a character. For a character whose emotional instability is apparently so key to his dangerousness, it barely has any screen time. We're told he has \"delusions of grandeur\"; the only time we see him behave in any way approaching that is during the approximately 10-15 minutes we see him as Sentry. Even that is somewhat weakened by the implications of Valentina's attempts at manipulation. And then Sentry gets offed and the void thing takes over. Now, the design of the void was pretty cool, I'll readily admit that. But the fact that it gets treated as an entirely separate entity while Bob remains pure and traumatized and helpless, which then somehow disappears after the Great Hug of Friendship when Bob is finally showing some agency & whose disappearance resets all the lives snapped into shadow, with no apparent consequence for Bob... that feels irresponsible. And somewhat lazy.This is the functional problem of having an actual character whose actions have actual consequences also be a symbolic representation of an intangible experience: the void thing gets dealt with internally, after it took over all of Manhattan and ruined however many lives. This is working under the assumption that everyone who got sent into the void would be stuck in a loop of their most traumatic memory. This, too, ought to be symbolic; even when we are not acting like ourselves, the pain we cause is still very real, even if we didn't have a choice over our actions. This is literally something that Bucky's character arc in Phases 2 & 3 directly dealt with, which is why it felt extremely confusing to me that this movie does nothing with that for Bob. It just ends. It's a strange way to treat such an emotionally delicate character and his actions.This film was marketed as an ensemble piece, and when it is truly focused on the group dynamic between Walker, Ghost, Yelena, and Bob-and Alexei, as the comic relief, I guess-it is enjoyable in a tired, often mean-spirited way. But in the third act, Walker and Ghost are sidelined in favor of exploring more of Yelena's inner turmoil and her relationship with Bob. It leaves them feeling incomplete as characters, which in turn jeopardizes the cohesion of the team. Ghost, especially, barely feels like an important character after the second act. All of the heavy lifting of her supposed redemption is apparently left in Quantumania, which is not good if the audience is supposed to give two hoots about her as a character in the film. Walker gets one emotional scene addressing his issues, and then seems a little bit humbled, but again, his growth feels stilted. Yelena is unquestionably the star of the film, and for as much as I love her, even her growth felt a bit rushed. For a film that is over 120 minutes long, it felt like too many things were either rushed, run over by a 16-wheeler, or dropped altogether.Which, in my head, leads to Bucky. I was curious about Bucky at the beginning of the film with the subplot of Valentina's impeachment and his apparent collaboration with Congressman Gary. But for all that I felt somewhat intrigued by his behavior, I was also unsettled by how... alone he seemed. Alone and ungrounded. And then, he drops the congressman angle altogether, seemingly because of a comment from Mel over the phone. Which leads him to \"the Thunderbolts,\" on whom he switches from kidnapper to somewhat teammate after a single phone call. Despite his history with Walker and (presumed history with) Yelena, he feels distinctly separated from the group. He ends up coming off as somewhat ornamental, which is heartbreaking, because I love Bucky Barnes as a character. Again, the ensemble marketing really made it feel like he would have more of a presence in the film, but what presence he has in the third act feels like a massive step back in his character development post-FATWS. On that note-the drama between him and Sam in the post-credit scene? Did they not just finish going through couple's therapy a few years ago in-universe? Or am I tripping?! I am baffled by how much must have happened between the end of FATWS and Thunderbolts* to get Bucky from redeemed, satisfied man with friends again to... whatever he is in this movie. It feels like a betrayal & retconning of Bucky's character arc thus far.And the fact that he just... joins the Thunderbolts? Like that?! With VALENTINA taking credit for them by the end? What are the writers for this franchise doing to Bucky? Everyone seems to have a different take on him, and Sebastian Stan is a good actor, but he can only do so much with scripts that are all over the place in terms of characterization.If Thunderbolts* had retained and committed to the atmosphere it had during the first half of the movie, it wouldn't be perfect, but it would still be better than what it ended up being: a half-baked attempt to say something meaningful with an abrupt end that felt like a slap in the face and a post-credits scene that felt like getting spit on by the people behind the creation of this movie.What is most frustrating is that this film had its moments of clarity. Yelena learning that she must care for and forgive herself before she can be effective at caring for others was nice. Mel's almost-defection triggered by Bucky was interesting before she did a full u-turn that's just explained as being another result of Valentina's manipulative \"genius\". The message of the final internal fight, that violence is not the answer to meaninglessness, but that we have the duty to end the cycle of viciousness towards ourselves and others? Great, even if it barely goes anywhere afterwards because the movie ends almost immediately. Even the impeachment storyline had promise. And yet, the film manages to fail to fully deliver on almost every front. It shoots itself in the foot by attempting to be simultaneously self-deprecating and emotionally impactful. And it left me wondering: who even is the target audience for this film? Outside of people like me, who would never pass up on a project starring both Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan.The one aspect of the film I feel no need to critique is the score. The music was spectacular. I immediately started playing the soundtrack after getting in my car, grumbling about the movie, confused and annoyed. Unfortunately, an amazing score is unable to make up for weak writing in a film that seems indecisive of what its own message ought to be.I was not expecting to watch an award-winning film. Keeping my expectations low, I was hoping to be entertained and maybe even satisfied with the story. Somehow, Thunderbolts* went below my already low expectations overall. A film that ended up feeling half-baked in its conclusion gets a 5/10.Bucky Barnes, get behind me. I'll be taking Yelena's adopted guinea pig with me, too. I'll watch Doomsday from afar.(Shortened review, excluding further commentary on the void & Valentina.)"

Before going, I don't think I had really heard or even seen anything bad about the movie. I thought to myself, maybe just maybe Marvel is finally reusing stories from the comics that aren't completely watered down and different.Regardless of the comic book adaptation, I think we can all agree that this movie was only made because of the slight success that the Suicide Squad ended up having. They were trying to push the PG13 rating but it is still all mostly childish humor with a few more curse words.Sentry was a somewhat interesting character at first, but then you instantly hinge all of his superpowers on a mental illness? Seems like a very intentional narrative they are trying to push on the audience for seemingly no reason. I am all for mental health awareness, but this comes off more as a glorification of it than\nbringing attention to mental health.The characters, even with their development from their other shows, really just don't move me much. Obviously, the goal of this movie is to bring them all back in the future, so why choose such a lacsadasical cast of heroes that really can only peak the audience's attention for maybe a movie.I love Florence Pugh as an actor, and I think her performance in the movie overall wasn't horrible. But a lot of the comedic scenes they forced on her character just were not funny at all. And yes, I am fully aware of Marvel's silly and dumb comedy they have been including for years. But when the actor is giving a bad performance during something that is supposed to be intentionally funny, it takes away from the scene entirely.Calling it right now, the next movie they are in will be them fighting the real next Avengers. I love how they are now repromoting the movie already with a different title because of the \"big twist\" at the end, when truly the twist is just as disappointing as the rest of the movie. This boring group of heroes gets tricked into being the (keep in mind) FAKE *New Avengers. And they all just go with it, too. Even after realizing that they all wanna be better people(Classic pointless Disney happy go lucky moment), they STILL decide to just continue working for the person who just tried killing all of them and is a horrible person.I hope this was more of a low-expectation problem and I can like it more on the second watch. Marvel is still one of my favorite franchises, regardless, I just want them to do better because they have unlimited content to pull from, and they still find a way to waste a lot of it."

There's very little I can say about the action - it's a superhero movie the action simply has to make sense inside the borderlines of the world created in the movie (and the entire MCU) it does, but most of the good comics do - I wouldn't be rating this one 9 if I didn't think it was good. The special bits are the humor and the soul of which this movie has aplenty. Regarding the humor I'll simply say what I already said more than once - without humor comics simply becomes an overwhelming mixture of pathos and melodrama. Without it, the soul wouldn't touch us, because pathos and melodrama make it all unrelatable and if its unrelatable one simply doesn't care.Here comes the real heart of the matter - this movie has so much heart/soul one has to care. In order to get all that soul, there are two things required: Good character must be written in. Well, they did wonders in this aspect, just like they did in GoG which I already mentioned. The other thing is proper acting performance, and as far as acting goes I can't remember such a collection of superb actors.Topping the list in my personal book is Florence Pugh. I've seen her in 5 or 6 movies in the last 4 years. She's never short of amazing. Same could be said about David Harbour. He's such an actor that one often doesn't notice unless his role is really standing out, but simply think how he combines funny, silly and heartfelt wisdom. A real discovery for me were Lewis Pullman and Wyatt Russell, both of them show more than simple professional brilliance. And I could go on without finding fault at any of the others. This collection of superlative performances together with top notch writing and directing makes this movie a real gem showing that there's still more to find in this genre if you're willing to put in the effort."

          "content": "Did We Just Get Punk Rocked by Marvel??Marvel's Thunderbolts doesn't play by the usual rules-and that's the point. It's loud, unpredictable, and refreshingly raw, like a punk rock anthem crashing into a billion-dollar franchise. But beneath the grit, sarcasm, and action, there's something deeper brewing: a surprisingly thoughtful conversation about mental health, trauma, and the complexity of redemption.Director Jake Schreier doesn't just give us a team of misfits-he gives us people grappling with identity, consequence, and emotional scars that can't be patched with super-serum or vibranium. These characters aren't trying to save the world. They're trying to survive themselves.Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) masks her pain with biting humor, but there's a weariness in her eyes that says more than any fight scene could. Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) continues to carry the weight of a century's worth of violence, haunted by ghosts that no mission can exorcise. John Walker (Wyatt Russell) is a man visibly unraveling, torn between ideals and reality. Even side characters like Ghost and Red Guardian aren't just there for spectacle-they're reminders that beneath every enhanced ability is a very human fragility.The film never gets preachy, but it doesn't hide either. It makes space for the unspoken: trauma doesn't disappear just because you're handed a second chance. Forgiveness-especially of yourself-isn't guaranteed. And mental health, especially in a world built on superhuman expectations, is not just relevant-it's essential.That's where Thunderbolts strikes its most rebellious chord. It dares to say that being a hero doesn't mean being invincible. Sometimes, the most courageous thing is facing your own mind.So, did we just get punk rocked by Marvel?Yes-and with it, a reminder that underneath the leather, explosions, and chaos, the most powerful fight is the one happening inside."

I almost cried during the movie because it was so emotional and also I have a friend and he told me before I met him that he was isolating himself in his room playing video games and he wasn't so social but he said I was the reason that I got him out of that situation and he's now more social and that's why this movie affected me because it made me think of my friend and I definitely enjoyed this movie."

          "content": "I don't think the problem with the MCU post-endgame had been a lack of great projects. There's more than a few they've made in this era that are in my top 10, it's about keeping that quality consistent while giving the sense that all these story's are actually leading to something. Thunderbolts might not reinvent marvels storytelling structure but it manages to use the things I love about this universe in a fresh way to deliver something not only enjoyable but surprisingly wholesome. It's not only a great movie, it's a great addition to the franchise and it finally manages to tee up elements that I'm excited to see come to fruition in future instalments.Jake Schreier manages to do something with this movie that only a few directors like James Gunn and Taika Waititi have done and direct an MCU film and have a real voice shine through. It's so well shot in how visually creative it is and there's a surprising amount done in camera. There's plenty of CGI of course but it feels like it's enhancing what's already there rather than using it as a crux when creating all of these sequences. The writing here is also really strong in a way that I noticed a lot more than I have in other MCU films at this quality. It has a lot to say about loneliness and depression and it manages to tackle it with a lot of respect and restraint and the script manages to incorporate those themes into the story fairly seamlessly. The actual climax is actually quite emotionally fulfilling and it can feel quite cheesy but in a way that I actually ended up liking.Thunderbolts is full to the brim with characters that either haven't been blessed with the best projects to star in or been in ones that haven't serviced them in a satisfying way. But I can honestly say most of these characters have never been better than they are in here. Florence Pugh is one of the best of her generation and she adds so much to this movie. I loved the arc they took that character on and she carry's so much of the emotional weight of this film, she's a bonafide movie star and one of the MCU's best current assets. John Walker was a character I actively disliked in Falcon and The Winter Soldier but for all the wrong reasons but they massively turned him around here. He's unlikeable at points but in the corrects ways this time and I actually came to like the douchey persona they gave that character. David Harbour continues to be the perfect comic relief, Hannah John-Kamen takes a nothing character from Ant-Man 2 and makes her one of the coolest parts of this movie and I really have come to like the elder statesman role they've given to the Bucky Barnes character, Sebastian Stan has more than earned it at this point.The story is solid and I actually liked seeing how they tied all of these characters together but I couldn't help but feel as if there were elements of it that could've been fleshed out more. The plot isn't as expansive as I was expecting and really stays put in a few locations and I think it hamstrung the development of these characters a bit. By the time the climax ramps up you're supposed to believe this group has this amazing connection but because of the limited amount of time that had actually passed it felt a bit rushed. I think this most rears its head in the Lewis Pullman's Sentry. He's great and adds a good amount of the emotional weight but I just didn't think his turn to the dark side was that earned and I think the idea that his connection to this group is what adds a lot of the conflict didn't really shine through as much as I think it should have.Thunderbolts ends up feeling like what I've been wanting from Marvel for a while now and this movie to me feels like a new template for them to follow. It's manages to fit in to the wider universe seamlessly all the while telling its own story and having a real personality. It has some of the MCU-isms that I've gotten tired off and not everything about how the sorry unfolds works but it really feels like they're building towards something meaningful again and despite the rocky road it's taken to get there I can't deny that I'm excited to see how things come to ahead."

          "content": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe went back to it's roots for the 36th film of the MCU - THUNBERBOLTS* - about a ragtag group of loveable losers who have to band together to save mankind from a planet-threatening force.And...darned it all...it really, really works!Why? Simply because the group of \"lovable losers\" are more lovable than losers and Director Jake Schreier (the under-rated ROBOT & FRANK) and Screenwriter Lee Sung Jin (BEEF) wisely decide to focus on the characters, their arcs (and redemptions) without overshadowing it by the spectacle and special effects and the result is an emotionally satisfying drama/comedy/action flick that will appeal to many.They also introduce the characters that eventually will end up becoming the THUNDERBOLTS* in such a way that one does not (necessarily) need to have seen any previous MCU films to understand what's going on (but watching the BLACK WIDOW movie and the TV Series FALCON & THE WINTER SOLDIER is helpful).And this is because THUNDERBOLTS* is populated from some strong, charismatic actors/characters starting with the incomparable Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova - sister of Scarlett Johansson's BLACK WIDOW. She carries this film dramatically, emotionally, comedically and action-ly (if that is a word). She is a true quadruple-threat in this film.She is counter-parted by David Harbour as Yelana's \"fake father\", also known as RED GUARDIAN. Harbour's out-of-shape, out-of-touch former hero who makes no secret of wanting to get back into the Super-Hero game is - by far - the funniest thing in the film.By contrast, Wyatt Russell's fallen Captain America, John Walker is sullen and angry and has (probably) the best redemption arc of all these characters as John Walker goes from a character of scorn to one that is truly one to root for at the end.Sebastian Stan (Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier), Hanna John-Kamen (Ava Starr/Ghost) and Lewis Pullman (the lovable \"Bob\") all add to the comradery of this group that is rivaled only, perhaps, by the camaraderie of the GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.And then there is Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as the \"don't trust her\" head of this group, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. She is the \"anti-Nick Fury\" as her character has no scruples or morals but we love to watch her as she slithers through the proceedings like the snake that she is.This being a Marvel Super-Hero movie, there is plenty of action and special effects, but Director Schreier wisely eschews the \"punchy, punchy, smashy, smashy\" finale that most of these films have for one that is more thoughtful, emotional and esoteric - and it works well.Oh...and if you go to this film...STAY for the scene at the end of the credits...it sets up the future of the MCU.The Best MCU film since AVENGERS: ENDGAME, check out THUNDERBOLTS*, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank(ofMarquis)"

          "content": "Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts (2025) is a bold, exhilarating, and emotionally resonant entry that signals a triumphant new era for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As someone who has followed the MCU since its inception, I found Thunderbolts not only a return to form but also a daring reinvention that stands confidently alongside the franchise's best team-up films. The movie's blend of explosive action, complex character arcs, and a refreshing focus on redemption and trauma sets it apart from recent superhero fare, making it a must-watch for both longtime fans and newcomers alike.A Darker, More Human Marvel\nDirected with precision and visual flair by Jake Schreier, Thunderbolts is Marvel's most mature and thematically rich film to date. The story revolves around a misfit group of antiheroes-Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, U. S. Agent, Ghost, and Taskmaster-who are forced into an uneasy alliance when a seemingly routine mission turns into a deadly betrayal orchestrated by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. The film's narrative is both straightforward and impactful, eschewing convoluted multiversal plots for a grounded, character-driven approach that explores accountability, mental health, and the struggle for redemption.What truly elevates Thunderbolts is its willingness to ask deeper questions: What happens when broken people are asked to save a world that has broken them? The film doesn't shy away from its characters' flaws or traumas, instead embracing them to deliver a story that is as emotionally resonant as it is thrilling.Stunning Performances and Chemistry\nThe ensemble cast delivers across the board, but Florence Pugh's performance as Yelena is particularly awards-worthy, bringing depth and vulnerability to the role. David Harbour's Red Guardian provides much-needed comic relief without undercutting the film's darker tone, while Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes reminds us why he remains one of the MCU's most compelling characters. The chemistry among the leads is palpable, making their reluctant camaraderie feel authentic and earned.Action, Humor, and Visuals\nThunderbolts excels in its action sequences, which are some of the most tense and inventive in recent MCU history. The film manages to balance high-stakes set pieces with moments of levity-Yelena's sharp wit and Red Guardian's over-the-top bravado keep the tone from becoming too bleak. Visually, the film is a treat, with dynamic cinematography and impressive effects that enhance the story without overwhelming it.A New Avengers for a New Era\nOne of the most exciting aspects of Thunderbolts is how it sets up the future of the MCU. The film's post-credits scenes tease the emergence of a new Avengers lineup, with Sam Wilson (Captain America) reluctantly approached about the Thunderbolts' transformation into Earth's Mightiest Heroes. This transition feels organic, as the Thunderbolts prove themselves not just as antiheroes but as true contenders to carry the Avengers mantle into the next phase of the MCU.Flaws and Final Thoughts\nIf the film has a weakness, it's in the rushed resolution of its final act. The climactic confrontation with Sentry and his darker alter ego, Void, is epic but could have benefited from a longer, more nuanced exploration. Still, this is a minor quibble in an otherwise outstanding film.Conclusion\nThunderbolts is a reminder of what superhero films can achieve when they prioritize character, emotion, and meaningful stakes over mere spectacle. It's a film that lingers long after the credits roll, not because of what it sets up, but because of what it says about healing, responsibility, and the courage to change. For me, it's easily one of the best Marvel movies in years-a thrilling, heartfelt, and utterly satisfying experience that leaves me excited for what's next."

The other half was packed with emotions, ingenuity, and meaningful action. We know what was second part of the movie about mental health, friendship, helping each other, unselfishness. Heroism. Guess then first part was about showing them as \"losers\", of how flawed, they are well, not flawed, sad. They all went trough hardship and were dealing with their sad lonely memories, and lives. So they got hurt they hurt others, others hurt them and so on. There's fight for power as a theme too. Initially. Each for themselves. Then cooperation. It got better as it went and they really progressed from bad to good, even the movie and the story did hah. And the visual aspects also, they were, let's say memorable. Later on. Characters and movie evolved and I kinda expected it will get better as it goes. Almost as if the whole movie was about getting better. Like a message, yeah I think that's the main one. David Harbours performance was most memorable he brought they joy and preaching of team, cheering. When everyone needed it. Atleast he cheered me up. Then Florence Pugh she was truly noble, she had grit. And yeah she took the initiative when it was most important, and others followed, I'm talking about the most important moment in the movie right now. That was such a memorable and impactful scene. The whole third part of the movie. I don't know much about comics and always dislike superhero movies, both Marvel and DC, this one is maybe only one likable because it's always naive and kinda pointless action with this one they atleast put in some exploration of important themes. Team work makes the dream work, if atleast all of humanity knew that... And Bob, at last, his performance was really good too. Not gonna' lie I don't know what rating this movie has PG-13 even I suppose -but later parts of the movie were looking like a horror. Like really a horror. So that was bit spooky really. It affected me a bit it was I don't know... Well. Glad they stopped him from constantly beating himself down."

I'm talking about everything released after Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness-almost everything was a letdown for viewers. It's not the best movie in the world, but it's a good one.I'm not sure if it's part of the universe that will lead into Avengers: Doom's Day or not, but it's a good story.However, looking at how they defeated a villain like The Void-honestly, a villain like The Void had the potential to be an extremely powerful threat. But from my perspective, the way they defeated him felt more like the power of friendship.Bob defeats his dark side by accepting that he's not alone, and then everyone comes out and The Void ends.As for the final scene, where that woman announces that these are the \"New Avengers\"-I don't know why they went with that, but it's clear there will be more parts coming. I don't think you need me to tell you that. That final cliffhanger makes it obvious there will be sequels.Most likely, this movie will tie into the universe building up to Avengers: Doom's Day.Overall, it's a good and enjoyable movie. You'll enjoy the story-just don't compare it to great films. Enjoy it for what it is. The fight scenes are good.As I said, the ending isn't very convincing to me.All in all, I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It's the best thing I've seen from Marvel since Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, so I'm happy.After this movie ends, I'll wait and see what Marvel brings in the coming months.But until then-enjoy this movie."

          "content": "Who would have thought a comic book movie would handle trauma, and mental health as well as this did. Marvel deserves a lot of credit for what they were able to pull off here. Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Lewis Pullman do most the heavy lifting, but there are great performances all around. Florence has really established herself as one of the top performers in Hollywood. She carries this movie on her shoulders and incredibly well. She was layered, vulnerable, and able to sell us, the audience on real emotions. Harbour is so versatile. He steals most the scenes with incredible comedic timing, but when necessary brings the heart. Lewis Pullman probably made his father very proud, he was impressive. I have heard people claim this is Marvel's version of, The Suicide Squad but I didn't see it that way. This movie without question makes its own way, and it's a unique one. Also worth noting the score is subtle but really good. The third act drags a bit, but deserves credit for trying something different. I think we can safely say, Marvel is trending the right way yet again. Can't wait for the Fantastic Four."

          "content": "Hats off to Florence Pugh for injecting some charisma into this film, but otherwise I found it to be little different from the latest slew of \"save the planet\" Marvel adventures that follows a predictable pattern of escaping from the frying pan into the fire a few times before it culminates in a proud declaration that a new franchise has been born. It turns out that \"Yelena\" (Pugh) has been working for years as an assassin for the \"Val\" (Julia-Louise Dreyfus) whose director of the CIA seems to have been running unfettered off-the-books projects around the globe trying to impose her own brand of world order. The US Congress is breathing down her neck, now, though - so it is time to eliminate all the loose ends. Of course, that doesn't quite go to plan and instead of disposing of the incriminating evidence, she merely galvanises an unlikely team of erstwhile employees of the agency to wreak their own vengeance. Meantime, the former \"Winter Soldier\" has got himself elected to the House and is now determined to work with those impeaching \"Val\" to bring her to book. Looks like \"Buckie\" (Sebastian Stan) might have to join this disparate group as it becomes clear that one of their number, the unassuming and pyjama-clad \"Bob\" (Lewis Pullman) might have more in common with \"Brightburn\" than \"Superman\". What now ensues is the usual team-building exercise as they learn to trust each other, reveal secrets from their typically troubled pasts and, of course, kick some ass. David Harbour enthusiastically delivers his \"Red Guardian\" character, as does the very slightly menacing Pugh, but the others in the gang are all instantly forgettable and though ostensibly darker than many of its contemporaries, it still suffers from the perennial problem facing the whole MCU: they tee up these baddies with overwhelming psychological and physical prowess and yet you always know there will be sunlit uplands at the end. Stick around til the very end of the credits, though, for perhaps the most poignant part of this film. It is, after all, all about who sells the brand."

Sure, Bob fighting himself isn't the most epic villain arc, but the character moments and laughs more than make up for it.

A group of former operatives is brought back together under suspicious circumstances, and from there, things escalate in unexpected ways. While trailers may have hinted at certain elements, the film still manages to deliver a satisfying evolution of its central conflict.For fans familiar with the comics, certain developments will feel rewarding. That said, the transition of one particular character from troubled ally to looming threat is executed with care and serves as a narrative highlight.The ensemble cast is strong, with familiar faces reprising their roles. The chemistry between them is where the film really shines. Some jokes may feel off or forced, but overall, the dynamic keeps the energy high and the pacing enjoyable. If you've been following the broader MCU, both films and series, you'll appreciate the character depth more fully. However, even for newcomers, the film does a decent job of giving just enough background to follow along.One notable weakness is the film's main handler character, who feels underdeveloped despite being central to the setup. The motivation is clear, but the execution lacks punch. Fortunately, the actor's performance elevates an otherwise flat role.Action is solid, dialogue is often sharp, and while the story doesn't break new ground, it delivers exactly what it promises: a fun, character-driven ride that sets the stage for what's coming next in the MCU.A decent watch especially if you're prepping for bigger events on the horizon."

Florence Pugh does a phenomenal job as Yelena, with great action and emotionally heavy scenes. Lewis Pullman also does a solid, as we are able to relate with his dilemmas. I wish this film was a bit longer tho, focused more on exploring each character's mental health. I hate how little time they gave in exploring the deeper traumas within Red Guardian and The Ghost, and they also wasted Taskmaster's potential (which was already half done in Black Widow). Alexei was present only for comedic relief, even though I should add David Harbour does that job perfectly. I also felt Bob's transformation to The Sentry felt pretty fast, considering he was able to control little to any of his powers. Maybe more scenes of him transforming into his dark self, forgetting his past and absolutely having that \"nothing matters anymore\" feeling would've elevated this movie. To sum up, this movie would've been far better if they didn't rush the whole character development and made the stakes higher. A solid 8/10 for me (or even a 7.5)."

Case in point, some days I can laugh at \"the marvels,\" other days- not so much. I believe \"thunderbolts*\" makes an interesting meta-reference in that sense, but that might be pushing it. The clearer objective evaluation is that the MCU, and Marvel comics in general, really always serves up the same thing all the time every time- ie. Schroedinger's cat is still a cat whether it's dead or alive the moment we see it. And that thing being served is good ol' fashioned comfort food. Sometimes it's overly sweet and fattening, sometimes it hits the spot, but it's the same calorie rich tasty pie and loaded plate. The cast and crew of \"thunderbolts *\" evidently realize that they helm a comfort food product and have endeavored to bring some meaning and substance and comfort in a world all-too-susceptible to the void of debilitating jadedness, crushing cynicism and angry reactionism. But that's probably pushing it as well. More likely, there's a formula being followed which stimulates just the right neural triggers to evoke an emotional response that will entice people to surrender their hard-earned income to a big, soulless corporate entity. But wait... Yelena seemed so sincere.. No, she's acting... But, it's coming from a good place.. No.. no, the character's an anti-hero. But there's still \"hero\" in the description. But it's got \"anti\" in front of it..!"

Yes, that's Daredevil, Luke Cage, Ironfist and Jessica Jones, with the addition of Winter Soldier as the link to Avengers. You've seen in the mini series, the first they met, they fought each other.2. DC's Flashtime Paradox (Animation)\nFocusing on the reacue of Superman who was stranded and captured in confinement. The Superman was thin because he was never expoaed to yellow sun, clueless, and weak. Marvel sabotaged Warner/DC to change the script to Supergirl in big screen, but watch the animation and you'll see.3. DC's Suicide Squad (2016)\nSpecifically, Amanda Waller. David Ayer's Suicide Squad was very close to the comics, unlike the 2021 James Gunn's rendition that was subpar story wise. The original Amanda Waller was a strong, very focused and very determined woman, which was the description of Valentina Fontaine's character profile. This was also the reason why Julia Louis-Dreyfuss got laid the big bucka dor thia film cause she recreated Valentina's personality to be her own.Story-wise, Thunderbolts was all over the place and reached nowhere. Florence Pugh's Black Widow became the main heroine and \"changed\" Sentry's mind, a direct rewrites from Avengers' Black Widow & Hulk aide story.Marvel fans will hate me for saying this, but Thunderbolts was never going to be a good film. It's just a film to rake in money due to Disney's and Marvel's turmoil film quality and box office income.I'm very disappointed by Thunderbolts, regardless how many talented actors they employed.

It never feels all over the place or confused about what it's trying to be. There are some heavy moments, especially around mental health, and I really liked how the film didn't shy away from letting those scenes hit hard. Lewis Pullman's character brings that theme to the forefront in a way that feels meaningful without being sappy. When the story needs to get dark or even a little sad, it leans into it in a way that gives the movie real emotional weight.The cast honestly might be the film's biggest strength. Everyone feels well cast, and the team has good chemistry that makes their interactions feel natural. Sebastian Stan's return as Bucky is reliably solid, bringing depth to the character with his usual quiet intensity. He brings that familiar weight to the character. Wyatt Russell really surprised me this time around. His take on John Walker is a lot more layered, showing the character's ego and anger without making him one-dimensional. He's actually very fun to watch. Florence Pugh, as always, delivers throughout the entire film, and excels in the more serious scenes. She has mastered the art of carrying emotional weight without overplaying it, and her presence adds depth to the group.On the visual side, the movie looks great. Nothing felt cheap or rushed. The action scenes stood out to me, really clean and hard-hitting. A couple of them somehow brought a new energy that felt fresh for Marvel. The choreography was tight, and the way those moments were shot made them even more fun to watch. And the score deserves real credit. It rarely gets much attention in Marvel movies, but here it really stood out."

Side note Bob is great and I loved the fact that her was not like the average villain in other films.Overall i thought it was great and definitely good addition to so many other great movies in the MCU. I can't wait for it to go onto Disney+ so i can watch it again.(well done to marvel for casting Florence Pugh, i think her as Yelena just adds to the storyline of the character coz she's such a great actor and works so well in the role)"

There was a moment in time where I almost did fall asleep, but Bucky managed to keep me awake I honestly think this movie should've just been a TV series instead instead of being another money grabber. Some of the characters tend to annoyed me. I just think that the story you really lacked depth I am really disappointed; would not watch."

If that's not the case, then it seems Marvel has set the bar so low with its recent lackluster offerings that even a mediocre film can stand out.The premise of the movie feels all too familiar: the government attempts to create a new super-soldier, and, predictably, things go awry. While the film does introduce a fresh angle by addressing mental health issues-something that resonates with many viewers today-it still doesn't elevate the overall experience.I have concerns about the character of Sentry. Much like Captain Marvel, he possesses such overwhelming power that it becomes a challenge for the writers to create meaningful conflicts or engaging storylines. This could ultimately hinder the Marvel universe rather than enhance it.In summary, while the film has its moments, it ultimately falls into the realm of mediocrity. The absence of A-list heroes has proven to be a significant hurdle for Marvel, leaving fans longing for the excitement and depth that once defined the franchise."

Or how about the instantaneous leap of faith of Bob becoming Sentry and he was somehow supposed to be easily controlled? Felt so rushed and idiotic. I was sitting there thinking wow that was fastWe get not one, not two, but three super soldiers. The only member of this new team with interesting abilities is Ghost.The ending was disappointing and even the short fight before it had terrible CGI. I'm sorry but nobody is willingly letting them self get \"voided\" into a black dust. After the events of Infinity war you would think they would be much more hesitant to let themselves go poof. Especially BuckyI don't know, there's just not really anything special here. Sentry/Bob was by far the most interesting thing and hopefully he gets more time in the future."

What could have been just another side mission turned into a story that made me care deeply about a group I barely knew going in. And then there's Bucky - anchoring this team with the quiet weight of experience and pain - helping transform this ragtag crew into the next Avengers at the end of the film. And honestly? I'm not complaining one bit.By the end, I knew I'd be back for a second viewing. Thunderbolts surprised me, impressed me, and most of all, reminded me why I love Marvel movies in the first place."

I wouldn't say a fun movie, but one that tackles deep messages of loneliness and bottled up emotions and does it fairly well. Even though sentry is one of the most powerful beings we have seen in the universe the movie is boots on the ground due to the hero's limited superpowers. The emotions this movie brings out is what gives it an 8 out 10 for me. A topic this deep is tough to tackle for a pg-13 movie, but Marvel surprised me here. I really enjoy the cast especially Florence Pugh as Yelena. Yelena is the main character of the film, but going through her deepest traumas and her connection with her family really pulls on your heart. John Walker was also really likable in the movie compared to his tv show and I am really enjoying the redemption arc from him. Overall a really good movie with a good message, and what post credit scene. Finally a scene that actually shows off the future of the MCU and hearing that music in it has me so excited for the future of the MCU."

But it's really time to move on from the Winter Soldier - ever since his redemption, he hasn't been able to fight like he used to. In fact, there were barely any proper fight scenes in the film. Taskmaster was both wasted and poorly written, which was disappointing. Red Guardian felt forced and mostly reduced to comic relief; it would've been nice to see him actually contribute beyond jokes. The visual effects were decent, and Sentry was a highlight. Given that almost every character in the film is a fighter, I wish there were more action sequences or at least deeper storytelling around their backgrounds."

The way audience gets to know the backstory of all the main characters is great.

Elizabeth Olsen completely abandoned her character's accent midway through the MCU and nobody cared Lol... The humour was the typical hit-and-miss that we're all used to it with Marvel, however, the dynamic between the main characters was fun to watch, for the most part, especially the scenes involving Walker and Bob.

Like... wow.First things first: the Thunderbolts-or as I like to call them, the New Avengers. The way the team comes together? So good. And the name \"Thunderbolts\"? Genius. Alexei had me laughing non-stop, literally every scene he was in had me cracking up. Him and Bob? My favorite new duo. Honestly, I think this team formation works way better than Sam Wilson's crew-but hey, I guess we'll find out for sure in Doomsday.Now let's talk about BOB / VOID / SENTRY. He's adorable. And hot. And just... wow. Lewis Pullman really delivered. I had seen him before in that movie with Chris Hemsworth, Dakota, and Cynthia Erivo, and he was great-but HERE? He ate. The Sentry is like this rule-following, borderline-Superman character (but actually cooler), and the Void? The total dark, broken side of Bob. That emotional side? So well portrayed. The fact that they defeated him WITH A HUG?? Incredible. Hugs really do save lives. And Bob... is just Bob. Precious.YELENA. OH MY GOD.This woman was a powerhouse in this film. She's THE perfect choice to carry the Black Widow legacy forward. Florence Pugh is that actress. I said it. Her performance? Unmatched. And... not to start anything but-was anyone else sensing some serious chemistry between her and Bob? 'Cause I was. Yelena's leadership is unmatched. She's absolutely the new leader of the Avengers and it was a chef's kiss move.Valentina? Yeah she's a snake-but she's an effective snake. She plans, she manipulates, she delivers. She's the reason the Thunderbolts exist (minus Taskmaster, who honestly felt like merch bait this time). And her assistant?? MY NEW OBSESSION. Geraldine is a sweetheart. I knew her from that comedy series with Daniel Radcliffe and now I'm in love. I'm still convinced she's Melissa Gold and the references are all there. If they give her powers in the future?? YES PLEASE.Okay, I might get roasted for this but-Ghost > Scott Lang. Yup, I said it. She was forgotten for six whole years and STILL came back with one of the strongest arcs. Her origin in Ant-Man and the Wasp was already great, and here? She leveled up. I think the new helmet is helping her control her powers and I loved that. Also? Her and Wyatt? Had a little something-something going on and I was living for it. And yeah, Wyatt (a.k.a. U. S. Agent) got his mini-redemption. Not perfect, but believable.And for the love of God, STOP calling Thunderbolts the Marvel Suicide Squad. NO. It's not that. This movie makes you laugh, think, and gives you legit amazing fight scenes.OH, and the post-credits scene??? Incredible. Iconic. 10/10. It's already setting up the Fantastic Four finale and I'm SO READY."

          "content": "Finally! Apart from Deadpool and Wolverine, I can't remember too many post Endgame MCU movies that have actually been fun to watch. Thankfully Thunderbolts* is a return to some MCU quality, bringing lots of laughs and some surprisingly strong emotional beats along the way.There are multiple reasons why this film works. Florence Pugh is always great, and she shines in this role. Yelena is a top character and she brings her to life and brings so much depth. In this film in particular Yelena gets some great writing and a good character arc. Wyatt Russell is rescued from the mediocre Falcon and Winter Solider show which was a welcome surprise. I enjoyed David Harbour's Red Guardian in Black Widow so it was great to see him again. Even bringing back Ghost was a nice treat! They all gelled together well and the dynamics between the characters and the actors just worked. It felt like the first Avengers film where everybody and everything just clicked.The plot is pretty good too although maybe could have done with a bit of refinement in parts. Lewis Pullman puts in a great performance to create one of the MCU's best villains in recent years. Again, he has great depth and an interesting arc. The film is maybe at its weakest when it's referencing other MCU movies and trying to set up new plot threads. This is par for the course with Marvel now as nothing is standalone, but these aren't major distractions. Most of this is confined to a post credit scene which really kicks the multiversal mayhem into gear, so stay seated for that.Overall this film is just a fun time. Good writing. Interesting character arcs. Top chemistry. Humour. Emotion. Action. The MCU is back in business!"

          "content": "The government assembles A covert team, pulling together a group of morally grey individuals with tangled pasts. Each of them brings a unique skill set-deadly precision, raw strength, cunning tactics, and unmatched resilience. Their mission is critical, but they're not your typical heroes. These are individuals who have walked the edge, battled their own demons, and now have a shot at something bigger than themselves. They're messy, flawed, and dangerous-but together, they might just be what the world needs.What makes this film stand out isn't just the action or the high-stakes mission-it's the depth of the characters. You see glimpses of redemption, regret, and reflection. These characters wrestle with who they were, who they are now, and who they could become. Their bonds are formed not just through battle, but through shared pain, dark humour, and the tough road toward trust. It's not about saving the world with capes and catchphrases-it's about fighting for a place in it, even when you don't feel like you deserve one.This story subtly champions mental health by showing that no one is too far gone to heal or to matter. Trauma, guilt, and struggle don't make someone broken-they make them human. It reminds us that growth can be painful, but it's also possible-even in the unlikeliest of people. And sometimes, the strongest warriors are those still learning to forgive themselves."

          "content": "Well the cats out of the bag, in what I understand to be an industry first, Marvel's newest blockbuster release Thunderbolts* is now officially known as The New Avengers, a move that has clearly been pre-planned but potentially rushed into action as their latest offering balances on that tricky line of the success and failure debate after its first week in theatres around the world.An undeniable success when it comes to some of the best Marvel reviews of recent years and audience sentiment that's currently seeing director Jake Schreier's feature sitting in the high 7's in IMDB ratings, Thunderbolts* does manage to mess with the stereotypical Marvel formula enough to ensure that while it feels familiar, there's still fun to be had here, particularly in the fact it isn't obsessed with ending its final act in a humongous battle for the planets survival that has become a tried and true staple for multiple decades.Turning its attention to bringing together a ragtag group of antiheros that are quite clearly being presented by Marvel as key players in the future of this comic centric universe, Thunderbolts* is built around an as to be expected top-notch performance from Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova who must work together with David Harbour as her limousine driving father Alexei Shostakov, Sebastian Stan as a down on his luck Bucky Barnes, Wyatt Russell as a rent a hero Captain America rip-off John Walker, Hannah John-Kamen as Ava Starr and Lewis Pullman as the mysterious Bob who have all had run-ins with Julia Louis-Dreyfus's corporate baddie Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.Kicking things off in great fashion as Belova completes a task while she battles her own mental demons and life crisis and wasting little time drawing all the key players into an unplanned meeting in a top secret bunker/research facility, Thunderbolts* keeps things moving across its 2 hour running time (including a significant post-credits sequence you should endure until the end for) and while there is a sense the spectacle and wow factor could've been more memorable overall, the chemistry between Schreier's cast members and their flawed but interesting characters ensures there's more to invest in here than most of Marvel's post-Avengers outings.While there's a lot to enjoy here in a throwaway sense, you can't help but feel as though Marvel's gamble on relying heavily on this contingent of characters and character arcs is still up for debate as a right or wrong decision.It's hard to suggest that these key players have the same spark and intriguing elements as a Tony Stark, God of Thunder, Captain America or Bruce Banner and while Thunderbolts* surface level examination of mental health and the power of friendship brings some new avenues to generic formulas, only time will tell as to whether audience embrace this new era to any close levels as has been done previously as the mountain to climb for Marvel remains well and truly unconquered as of this moment.Final Say -Thunderbolts* is an above average piece of comic inspired fair but still lacks the same magic and creativity of Marvel's best works. A step in the right direction while being a far cry from the pinnacles of what has come before it, Thunderbolts* remains an unknown in these early days before Marvel throws everything at reigniting there once indestructible cinematic universe.3 1/2 inopportune press conferences out of 5."

It did not try to reimagine existing Avenger characters but build new, fresh ones. There is enough action to keep you in the movie while also building on the characters backstory.

To begin, let us consider Guardians of the Galaxy.It was good. Did something hard to do, so incredibly well. Thunderbolts did it better.For some reason, that's controversial when talking about a superhero film. We forget that the expectation of what this art is to be, is squarely on the viewer. It is a genre piece, to which I thought was soon to die along the western.Then Act 2 happened and I loved a bored assassin, awkward father daughter plots made adorable by the fantastic acting, Ghost finally getting some screen time, Walker gaining complexity, Bucky being Papa Smurf, New Avengers, & more!Sure, there are plot holes & devices & armor but we are watching superhero films. To me, I'm okay with the lot of them until the \"action figure white-noise-CGI-barf-fest\" of the third act.Act three happens.I love this firetrucking* movie.No, I mean I looked upon the wreckage of experiment of failure & success of the Disney machine & I believed even they would be unable to stop the sinking titanic of superhero films.Then they gave me Thunderbolts & I learned to believe again. They filled this cast with actors who have chemistry & the third act ends the way that makes my heart sing.Also, who knew a sitcom actress, who starred in a show about nothing, could be my favorite Marvel anti-hero to date (heart emoji).Thank you to everyone who worked so hard on this film to make it such a delight. Have you restored my faith? No.But you've earned back some trust.That third act...I wept...I wept...thank you for that third act (heart emoji)."

Yes it has the team up and comedy, but it does add some major emotional moments that show everyone is dealing with something and we all need to be there for each other. Now the review would have been a 8/10 but I have to say I was truly disappointed when task master was killed off so quickly and suddenly. I was hoping to see her character grow and loved her new suit. When she died I was like nah she'll be back she isn't dead. Yea she was. They should have kept her and killed her off at the end at least. All in all I think it was poor writing and not even a true shock, just a major disappointment. Florence Pugh is amazing as always and did alot of her own stunts which I love when actors/actresses do that. Marvel did well with this and didn't spoil much in the trailers like some of the recent ones. Great movie for any Marvel fan! Oh and the actual title which shows up at the end is an amazing reveal in my opinion. The New Avengers (Avengerz) ! You'll get it after you see the movie."

          "content": "I enjoyed the film. I'd give it a B+. Plenty of humor though the film doesn't come across as satire or parody. I liked that the film dealt head-on with the traumatic experiences of some of the characters. Not everyone got a glimpse into their troubled past. But for those it did delve into, that was significant. Enough can't be said about Wendell Pierce in a thankless supporting role as congressman Gary. (Sidebar: it's never stated-- and I'm sure, deliberately-- just what party, if any, that the newly elected congressman James Buchanan \"Bucky\" Barnes belongs to. Just something else to set the internet on fire if it were revealed, I suspect.)When I watched the film, I couldn't help but to wonder about its two high profile defections: (Beef's Stephen Yeun was initially cast as Bob, which initially raised the ire of the \"I'm not racist I'm just a comics purist\" fan faction online; The Bear's Ayo Edebiri was initially cast as original character Mel). Still, the performance of Lewis Pullman as Bob is wonderfully quirky and Geraldine Viswanathan's Mel, the put-upon personal assistant, is a nice touch.Julia Louis Dreyfus hams it up as Valentina, depicted here as an ethically unmoored, power-hungry bureaucrat. It's a far cry from the original comics' depictions of a vampy she-spy and love interest of Nick Fury. Of course, the same goes for Nick Fury, if your frame of reference are the original 1960s comics and not the early aughts The Ultimates comics.Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova (recently dubbed the White Widow in the comics) is the emotional anchor of the story. Her character is still reeling from the death of her foster sister Natasha and the seeming abandonment of her \"Dad\" Alexei the Red Guardian (David Harbour): As the film opens he is eking out an existence in the Washington, D. C. area as a limo driver, while dreaming of somehow being able to rekindle his Soviet Union-era fame as a state-sponsored propaganda hero.Wyatt Russell does a fine job as John Walker, the ersatz Captain America - turned - \"US Agent\". He's still on the arrogant side of the fence, and probably more than a little depressed about his public fall from grace a few years back. He considers himself the natural leader of this ad hoc group, though it's clear that no one else feels the same way. Hannah John-Kamen's Ghost gets the least introspection out of anyone, and that's despite a shocking turn of events early in the plot involving her and another member. But the actress holds her own as a fellow metahuman misfit in crisis. Her last appearance featured Lawrence Fishburne as her mentor, and he is missed.The Oscar nominated Sebastian Stan has been playing Bucky in film since 2014, over 10 years now. It's amazing to think about, really, that this character who originally was a 13-year-old sidekick in the Captain America comics-- and who was \"officially dead\" for decades by a previously sacrosanct editorial dictum-- has become an enduring co-star in the MCU saga. His character clearly has chosen to try and publicly work with the system as a legislator, and it's a provocative touch to see how far he's willing to go to seek justice, now that he's wearing a suit to work every day. (Another sidebar: does he get to bypass the Capitol Building's metal detectors because of his, er, special prosthetic?)The filmmakers deserve credit for having a climax that, while violent and chaotic, does not have the typical \"let's try to blow it up different than the other film\" approach. We'll see what the future holds for the Thunderbolts*. I just hope that group therapy is part of the equation. Self-care is caring, right?"

Thunderbolts stands out as a refreshing and emotionally resonant entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), breaking away from the typical superhero formula to deliver a character-driven narrative that deeply connects with its audience.The film assembles a compelling team of antiheroes-Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), U. S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), and Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko)-each grappling with their own past traumas and moral ambiguities. Their forced collaboration under the manipulative CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) leads to unexpected camaraderie and personal growth.Florence Pugh delivers a standout performance as Yelena, infusing the character with wit, vulnerability, and strength. Her portrayal anchors the film, providing both emotional depth and levity. The ensemble cast shares remarkable chemistry, making their interactions authentic and engaging.Director Jake Schreier masterfully balances action and introspection, allowing the film to explore themes of redemption, identity, and the complexities of heroism. The narrative doesn't rely on grandiose battles or overwhelming CGI; instead, it focuses on the internal struggles of its characters, making their journey all the more compelling.Thunderbolts also addresses mental health with nuance and sensitivity, particularly through the character of Bob (Lewis Pullman), whose internal battles manifest in unexpected ways. The film's depiction of depression and the importance of support systems adds a layer of realism that resonates with viewers.In a time when superhero fatigue is a common sentiment, Thunderbolts revitalizes the genre by prioritizing storytelling and character development over spectacle. It's a testament to what the MCU can achieve when it dares to diverge from its established formula.If you're seeking a Marvel film that combines action, heart, and thoughtful storytelling, Thunderbolts is an absolute must-watch. It's a cinematic triumph that redefines what a superhero movie can be."

And the end credit scene it was amazing. I think it is better than guardians of the Galaxy too.

The movie is smart, fast-paced, the action scenes are entertaining and wonderfully choreographed, it takes back to the very roots of superhero movies and use it to show how a bunch of misfits can get their shot at being genuinely good.But what floored me was the level of depth this movie reached, finally addressing the mental health situation of its characters, digging through levels of grief and trauma and anger and pain to achieve closure and acceptance, while still being insanely fun at times (David Harbour is a comedic genius).There are two standalone events in this movie, though, that made it exceptionally good. First, Florence Pugh is a powerhouse : she is amazing in every scene, whether emotionally raw, hilarious or just existing as Yelena. And the arrival of Sentry really tugged at my heartstrings, as Lewis Pullman gives a phenomenal performance as Bob, and his inner battles are both heartbreaking and oh, so relatable.I feel so, so good about Marvel's second wind, and the post post credit left me so excited about the Fantastic Four.Trust the new avengers, they are gonna rock your world !"

The movie tries really hard to make Yelena relatable, to make her seem like just another person struggling to find their place in the world but it fails. While Yelena's situation is very relatable, and in normal circumstances would make one grow fond of her, the movie doesn't build her up at all. The movie never gave me a reason to care about her struggles. Now, for the rest of the characters, it is much the same. The only standout for me was David Harbour's character, who I would describe as funny.The acting in this film wasn't anything to write home to either. One actor did stand out though, just not in the way Marvel hoped. That was Sebastian Stan. He is a very talented actor, perhaps the most in this film, but he never got the chance to showcase that in this film. He also gave off the sense that he didn't want to be there. Like, he was contractually forced to do this movie. Coming off an Oscar nomination for an amazing film like The Apprentice, this must sting for him.Overall, I would describe the film as dull and forgettable. Slop served on a silver platter. Which is nothing new for Marvel."

What we got instead was a hollow thud of disappointment.Yeah, I'm disappointed.Everyone's raving about Pugh, but honestly, I found her performance flat and forgettable. People keep calling her an incredible actress, but all I remember is a lifeless expression, sleepy energy, and a Russian accent that didn't even sound Russian. The chemistry? Virtually nonexistent. Some of the worst I've seen in recent memory. Peter Quill and Rocket had more spark than the entire Thunderbolts cast combined.And then there's the so-called \"action.\"At this point, I think we're all exhausted by the same tired trope: the 5-foot heroine effortlessly mowing down a group of massive men without so much as a scratch. It's not thrilling anymore. It's just lazy. And yep, they did it again.Now let's talk about the male characters.Why does Marvel keep writing male co-stars to look like clueless sidekicks next to their female leads? It doesn't add anything to the story. If anything, it just comes off as another swing at that tired \"women smart, men dumb\" messaging Disney keeps forcing in.Even the villain, who had some potential, was undercut by how rushed everything felt. The build-up lacked tension. It felt like the cast had a Tuesday deadline to wrap shooting and just phoned it in.There is a formula that works in action films, and it's not rocket science:Act 1: Introduce the villain early. Build suspense.Act 2: Strip the villain of power temporarily so the heroes can rise.Act 3: Stage a real battle. The heroes should get crushed, badly. One should die, another barely survive. Make it public. Make it hurt.Act 4: Raise the stakes. Capture a hero. Make the threat personal.Act 5: Let the team regroup in desperation. Bring back the injured hero. Maybe throw in a surprise cameo. Let the final fight feel earned.That's it.Seriously. That's all you need.Instead, we got... sigh."

The movie had this energy that pulled me in, like I was part of something-even without anyone sitting next to me. I didn't catch all the earlier Marvel shows on Disney+, but it didn't matter. The way these characters showed up and unfolded onscreen really caught me off guard-in a good way.One character, Bob, had a particularly compelling and haunting arc, and his unique abilities led to some truly memorable moments. It actually gave me a spark of inspiration. I started imagining a version of Sonic the Hedgehog with a similar ability in a future Marvel project. It's the kind of idea that just plants itself in your head and stays there.A lot of people seem to think the movie is all over the place, but I felt the opposite. It's got a clear tone, a sharp edge, and moments that feel grounded. There's one scene-no spoilers-where Yelena drops from a tall building and everything about it felt intense and real. That wasn't just a stunt double doing their job. That was a moment that reminded me why I still get excited about these films.What hit me hardest is the theme: even when these people feel like they have no one, they're not truly on their own. They still choose to show up for each other. And that's something I think a lot of us people and their friends can relate to.I'm already looking forward to what comes next. Fantastic Four: First Steps, Avengers: Doomsday, and of course, Secret Wars. The multiverse is wide open, and I'll be watching. I have a feeling the team I just met-and Bob-will definitely be back."

E., led by the manipulative Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a group of elite antiheroes finds themselves marked for elimination. With government pressure mounting and Congressman Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) closing in on her operations, Valentina orders the destruction of all evidence-including the operatives themselves: Black Widow Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), the volatile John Walker (Wyatt Russell), the elusive Ghost/Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen), and the deadly Taskmaster.Trapped inside a facility set for incineration, the betrayed agents must band together to survive. During their daring escape, they encounter a mysterious stranger named Bob (Lewis Pullman), who has just awoken from a long, induced sleep. As they flee, Bob's true identity and world-shaking powers come to light-he is the Sentry, an unstable super-being capable of unimaginable destruction.Now fugitives and outgunned, the reluctant team must align with Bucky Barnes and Red Guardian to confront Valentina, uncover the dark secrets behind O. X. E., and stop the unleashed power of the Sentry before he brings about global annihilation.Review\nReview: Thunderbolts\nThis is the first Marvel film I've seen in cinemas since Spider-Man: No Way Home. Like many others, I experienced superhero fatigue and took a break from the genre, watching most Marvel releases on Disney+ instead. Since Endgame, few entries have truly grabbed me-but I felt it was time to give Thunderbolts a chance.The film opens on a surprisingly dark note, focusing on Yelena Belova's isolation as a super-powered secret agent. At first, I wasn't sure this was going to be the right film for me. However, once the prolonged introduction wraps up, the pace picks up quickly and the core story begins to take shape.Though it follows the familiar Marvel formula in some ways, Thunderbolts distinguishes itself with a strong emphasis on its team of misfit antiheroes-a sort of \"Suicide Squad\"-style ensemble-each grappling with their own personal demons and search for redemption. As the film progressed, I found myself unexpectedly invested in their journeys. It was refreshing to see a Marvel movie with characters that have real emotional weight, rather than just sky-high battles between invincible titans.The performances were strong across the board. Wyatt Russell was a standout as the wannabe Captain America, John Walker. His portrayal of a fallen, gritty version of the star-spangled hero-complete with sarcastic, darkly funny one-liners-was the most compelling arc in the film for me. Lewis Pullman also delivered an excellent, unsettling performance as Bob, adding depth to a complex and mysterious character. Florence Pugh brought consistency and heart to Yelena, keeping the emotional core of the movie alive.The only disappointment for me was Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes. His role felt underwritten, with minimal development and not much substance in terms of dialogue or impact.Director Jake Schreier did a solid job balancing character-driven moments with Marvel's signature action and visual spectacle. The production quality was what you'd expect from the MCU-slick, cinematic, and well-executed. While comparisons to Suicide Squad are inevitable, Thunderbolts adds a level of sincerity and introspection that I haven't seen in a Marvel film for quite some time.If I had one major criticism, it's the runtime. Despite being only around two hours, the film felt a bit too long. Trimming 15-20 minutes-especially from the slower, more dialogue-heavy scenes-could have tightened the pacing and kept engagement stronger throughout.Still, Thunderbolts turned out to be a pleasant surprise. While it doesn't completely reinvent the Marvel formula, it offers a fresh take with more emotional weight and character-driven storytelling. For fans who've grown weary of the usual bombastic approach, this film brings something a little different-balancing introspection with action. It's not perfect, but it's one of the more engaging and memorable entries in the MCU in recent years.Action 7\nActing 7\nStory 7\nMusic 6\ncinematography 7\nDirecting 7\nWatchability 6\nTotal score 6.7 out of 10."

Not in the Marvel world, it seems. In the Marvel world, it seems extras are told to keep their heads forward and keep on waking as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening. It's something that I found very distracting, and shows a lack of attention to detail, with the film makers so concerned about the big things that were happening that they gave little thought to the smaller details."

The final scenes show Red Guardian in a costume with 'AvengerZ' emblazoned on it, a symbol heavily associated with Russia's military actions in Ukraine. Given the ongoing conflict and the suffering it has caused, this choice feels insensitive and irresponsible.The narrative's subtle suggestion that Russian characters are morally superior or more stable than their American counterparts also raises concerns about unintended propaganda. Glorifying Soviet aesthetics and symbols linked to war crimes is not only tone-deaf but also hurtful to those affected by the war.Marvel and Disney should strive for more thoughtful storytelling in their global blockbusters."

This movie is 1000 percent the best Marvel Movie Post Endgame and they are already getting ready for Avengers Doomsday and Secret Wars and the fact that the Thunderbolts* are the new Avengers is amazing. I knew Taskmaster would die but I didn't expect it to be so suddenly I don't really care how quick it was though because that first fight scene between, Yelena, John Walker, Taskmaster and Ghost i can see that being one of the iconic fight scenes in all of Marvel Cinematic Universe History. Movie was a 10/10."

          "content": "The 36th MCU release and the last film of Phase Five is one of the best written and directed entries Marvel have produced in a while. Rather than relying on the over use of CGI and extravagant set pieces Thunderbolts actually takes it's time to get to know the characters and care about them as well as addressing issues such as depression, loss and trauma. In other words because these superheroes are flawed they are more three-dimensional.Director Jake Schreier still provides the usual thrills, chases and fight sequences courtesy of some very good CGI, but there's a nice balance of light and dark tone throughout and he doesn't rush into things to grab the attention. It all feels much more organic and grounded than usual. All of the prinicipal characters are engaging especially David Harbour providing the much welcomed light relief.British actress Florence Pugh shines the most here as Yelena Belova, reprising her role from Black Widow (2021). Having been traumatised by the loss of her sister in Avengers: Endgame (2019) she finds herself trapped alongside a group of not so super heroes in a disused laboratory where they find Bob, a timid person who doesn't realise he has been experimented on as part of the Sentry project that unscrupulous CIA director Valentina Fontaine wants destroyed to cover up her misconduct now the Avengers are no more.After escaping the lab and finding hidden indestructable super powers when faced with a firing squad, Bob gets recaptured by Fontaine to reignite the Sentry project while the others make their escape. However Bob's troubled and destructive alter ego comes to the fore and he unleashes a dark power on New York City known as The Void. It's up to the other reluctant heroes to come together to rescue Bob, restore order and hold Fontaine to account.It's a nice twist on the anti-hero and with a clever turn of events at the end this is one of the more satisfying movies Kevin Feige has produced for the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

The most creative 3rd act in a marvel movie since the first doctor strange.The acting is ranging from great to fantastic! Florence Pugh is fantastic, sentry is a standout and one of the best characters, and the actor is amazing! (Originally Steven Yuen, but I don't mind honestly, the actor was amazing). David harbor is great, USAgent is great, the villain while a bit cliché has at least a fun personality that I vibe with.It also finally feels connected to the MCU and has actual forward momentum.Great movie, top 3 of the year. 8.5/10."

It seemed to focus more on mental health than showing the new heroes doing much in the way of heroism.Honestly, this movie was a little too focused on mental health to be entertaining. The main antagonist creates a superhuman called 'the sentry,' whose alter ego 'the void' is basically that person's depression in the flesh, so to speak. The new heroes have to battle the depression in a psychological showdown to convince Bob (the Sentry) that he's not alone in life. It's a little too real, metaphorically speaking, to be as entertaining as I hoped it would be.I typically watch superhero movies to swept away by their fantastical display of abilities in the face of grave dangers, which are usually of the physical sort. This movie focused more on inner demons, which was just a little too real for me to enjoy much. I am looking forward to seeing how the Thunderbolts battle a real villain, rather than the depressed side of another hero.All that aside, the action bits of this movie were entertaining, but I did not care for the battle within the inner workings of Bob's mind. That was a bit too far fetched for me. We'll see how these new heroes play out when they are a part of the Avengers: Doomsday movie.At least this was better than the new Captain America movie."

          "content": "As a big fan who's seen every single Marvel film and show, I was genuinely looking forward to Thunderbolts. The cast looked great, and the idea for the team sounded really interesting. But honestly? It just didn't work well. It was quite disappointing.The main problem, which feels like a pattern lately, was the tone. They tried to mix serious parts with Marvel's usual jokes, and it didn't connect for me. Most of it wasn't funny - maybe a couple of moments were amusing, but that was all. The film felt like it was fighting against itself, jumping between different moods without flowing smoothly.Aside from the tone and weak humour, other things were disappointing. The Russian accents, to be direct, weren't good and were quite distracting. The action scenes weren't impressive either; the best part was the scene with Bucky and the cars, which was alright, but the rest felt forgettable.For the characters, it was hard to care about most of them. Florence Pugh was great in it, although I do wish her Russian accent had been better. Bob was honestly the only one I found watchable, and Lewis Pullman did a good job there. But many on the team felt neglected. Ghost, for example, seemed to have no development since her last film; nothing much happened with her story. What they did with Taskmaster was frustrating. Ghost killing her early on, and then Ghost not showing any remorse or getting redemption? That felt like a poor choice and a waste of Taskmaster as a character.Then there's the fact that my opinion of characters like Bucky and John Walker was already coloured by The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, a series I really disliked. For me, that show ruined Bucky's character, and it felt like both Bucky and Sam (Falcon) were just being deliberately difficult towards Walker, who I felt was actually trying to be respectful and is ultimately a hero. FATWS also completely missed the mark with the Flagsmashers, portraying them as anything other than the terrorists they were, and Falcon's speeches in that series were frankly terrible. Honestly, I felt that show had no good parts at all.Coming back to Thunderbolts, after seeing his character in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, where his background as a decorated and intelligent veteran was shown, Walker seemed like a much simpler version here. Plus, he seemed to be constantly disrespected, which still didn't fit with his background.The story itself had confusing moments. That part with Bob, where the team went after him aggressively even though he didn't seem to be attacking right then - it felt forced, like the plot needed them to fight without a clear reason. Them deciding to just walk into that void to save New York seemed questionable too. And in a film set mainly in New York, not seeing Kingpin felt strange after the Daredevil series.Overall, the film felt like it was trying too hard and didn't quite know what it wanted to be. For me, it doesn't compare well to earlier MCU films in general. Those older films, and shows like the better ones in the early phases, felt much more solid and less confused than this.Putting it next to recent films like The Marvels (0/5 for me) and Brave New World (1/5), Thunderbolts might get a 2/5. So, it's slightly better than those, I suppose. But honestly, with the cast and the idea they had, it should have been much better. It was a real disappointment.Despite the let-downs with Thunderbolts, I do think the future of Marvel can still be better. Bringing in genuinely new characters feels like a great way forward for the universe. With the Fantastic Four coming out soon, there's hope that this could be a fresh start and inject some new energy into things."

I had a conflict of what kind of genre I wanted to be.In general, the production value was very good. One thing in particular that I noticed was really good was the fight scenes. They were very well choreographed and there weren't a lot of cuts to different shots. There were a lot of one shot fight scenes, which means that they didn't have to cut parts from different fights to cobble together fight scene. Everything was choreographed extremely well.The characters were OK. David Harbour was my favorite for sure. Florence Pugh did a good job and Sebastian Stan was also good. The rest unfortunately fell flat. I didn't really feel the chemistry between them.Overall, a decent movie and if you like Marvel movies it's worth the time and money."

          "content": "I have to say that this movie was truly incredible and, for me, a great surprise. I confess I wasn't expecting it to be this good, especially considering how many recent Marvel productions had pushed me away from the franchise.This movie is incredibly well done and much deeper than we could have imagined. Each character carries their own pain, and when they come together, it feels like they complete one another, helping each other face their struggles. This movie talks about mental health, real-life problems, and shows how we can deal with them.Speaking of the cast, many people criticized the Thunderbolts lineup, but this movie proves them wrong. The cast delivered a fantastic performance, and I'd like to highlight some of them.We have to acknowledge that Florence Pugh is no longer just a rising star - she's already one of the best actresses working today. After so many strong performances, she once again shows her talent here. Her character is deeply complex and emotionally layered, and she portrays it brilliantly.Sebastian Stan shines once again as Bucky. I really enjoyed his character, although I must say he didn't have as much screen time as I expected. Still, considering the screenplay, I don't see that as a real problem. As for Hannah John-Kamen's character, I admit I didn't think she was that relevant to the MCU before, but in this movie, she truly impressed me. I really liked her character. Unfortunately, it felt like the writers didn't want to explore her arc further or remind us of her pain, unlike what they did with the others.Wyatt Russell as U. S. Agent was fantastic - he's one of my favorite characters in the group. His character also carries personal conflicts that add depth, while still being a great source of comic relief. David Harbour also brought a lot of humor to the film and made me laugh several times - he really showed how great he is.The same goes for Sentry, played by Lewis Pullman. He's a deep character too, but also funny. I loved his development and how the Thunderbolts helped him grow and deal with his inner struggles. I'm really excited to see more of him in future productions - and I can say the same about the rest of the characters.Now, regarding the movie itself, the only thing that really bothered me was how disconnected Marvel productions still are. The issue presented in this movie is massive, and other heroes should've shown up - even if the Avengers are disbanded. It's strange that Spider-Man, Daredevil, Punisher, and other NYC-based heroes weren't even mentioned. Honestly, this is more of a Marvel-wide issue than a flaw in this specific movie.And I have to admit I felt a bit strange when I read spoilers about the group's new name before watching the movie. But considering Valentina Fontaine's political arc, it makes sense - and I'm very excited to see where that goes. I also have to say I found it a bit odd that Bucky agreed to be part of the group, especially considering his efforts to bring Valentina down. I think the movie should've emphasized his intentions more clearly.Still, I can say I really enjoyed this film, and I'm very excited to see more from these characters. I have to congratulate everyone involved - this is one of the best Marvel productions in recent years and has brought back many fans who had drifted away, like me."

          "content": "I had pretty high expectations going into this movie due to some of the more rave reviews. It didn't quite meet my expectations but it was still an enjoyable watch for many reasons. First, its exploration of depression, trauma, and shame was pretty well done and it sort of reminded me of Wandavision on how it explored similarly emotional topic as grief. I wouldn't say the conclusions drawn out from it was not beyond elementary, but for Marvel standards, it was still fresh. There were definitely moments where I think it handled those heavy topics well. I also enjoyed JLD's role as Valentina. For someone who recently finished the series \"Veep\", it was fun to see her in a very similar role as Selina Meyer. The ending was so classic Selina that I chuckled out loud. It must have been easy for JLD to channel her Selina as Valentina.Post-Avengers Marvel has been struggling quite a bit with lack of direction and it was nice to see a world where I think properly described a world where powerful superheroes lacked. I also enjoyed Marvel's take on how humans and heroes can coexist (or not) as other popular superhero shows have done like \"Invincible\" and \"The Boys\".I also really enjoyed the overall visual of Void and how the shadows were cast over the city. The interconnected room of memories was also a cool approach in terms of describing various trauma. The overall message was that the harder you fight your \"darker\" ego and thoughts, the more likely you will succumb to the darkness itself. The best way to heal is through other people, which is a fair point. I guess my only criticism lies with the writing as I felt the friendships between the \"New Avengers\" formed a little too quickly. Similar approach would have worked better in something like the original Avengers where each character already had more established movie under them. It's hard to describe what really tied them together.However, this was still a great addition to the declining MCU and I hope Marvel makes more movies like these with intentions. This could be the beginning of the long-awaited revival."

It was beautifully done.What made it even more impactful was that every character was carrying their own weight, facing personal struggles that felt deeply human. Yes, this was a superhero movie, but it was also a reminder of why Marvel remains my favorite comic creator; their heroes feel real. They struggle. And putting those struggles front and center on the big screen is so important. It shows people who are fighting their own demons that even the most powerful heroes are vulnerable to the same things we are.Overall, it was a beautifully told story. The only reason it didn't get a higher rating from me is because I wish it had been longer... there was more ground to cover, especially with characters like Ava/Ghost, who definitely deserved more depth."

I walked in expecting yet another Marvel production seemingly penned by a committee of interns whose only creative references are memes and supermarket tabloid headlines. You know the type-every character blurting out five canned jokes per scene, just in case we'd forgotten we were watching \"fun for the whole family\".But no. Shockingly, they appear to have locked that particular writer in a cupboard somewhere and actually hired someone with... what's the word? Ah, yes-standards. This one treats the audience as though we might, on occasion, be capable of independent thought. The writing is sharp, the humour isn't slapped across your face like a wet cod, and-brace yourself-they even manage to explore mental health without turning it into a punchline or a preachy after-school special.The performances are genuinely impressive, the action sequences are properly exhilarating, and the effects? Expensive enough to suggest someone, somewhere, actually cared. I was prepared to endure two hours of corporate sludge. Instead, I left... dare I say it... entertained. Astonishing."

Most people are wondering how this bit of typography will stack up in the long run against such starry classics as 61* and M*A*S*H. After the novelty wears away from THUNDERBOLT's star, I think that it is likely that 61* will revert to its position at the top of the theatrical-release-only asterisk list. (M*A*S*H, of course, is more famous as a television situation comedy than as a film raking in bucks at the box office.) 61* derives from the Real Life suffering of Roger Maris, hounded into an early grave by Mickey Mantle and the ghost of Babe Ruth. BAT*21, by the way, has nothing to do with Mantle, Ruth, Maris or baseball. Space does not permit a closer examination of the other 107 headings on the official asterisk-in-the-title list."

Is he an a-hole.yes, but plays it so well and give plenty of laughs in the process.Finger crossed Marvel keeps this up. 7.5/10."

We only see sentry for like 1 time in the movie. The fight choreography was not great but still good. The CGI is good wherever its used. But you'll feel highly unsatisfied after the movie ends. It just builds and builds towards a grand climax but instead what you get is lewis Pullman fighting another Lewis Pullman. The odea was completely logical but highly unsatisfying.Overall great watch at home. I wouldn't go to watch this movie in theatres."

E. Loki in \"Avengers\". This is absolutely NOT what Thunderbolts was. When I was watching this movie I was blown away. The heroes are in fact not heroes. They're disgraced and hated murderers. What separates them from the villains of other MCU titles is that they're not evil, they're flawed. This is something most Superhero titles gloss over; the humanity of the antagonists. This movie shows these characters struggling with their pasts and also the desire to become better people, all culminating with the team assembling through their similar struggles. The movies metaphors for severe depression and that the true villain was something inside all of us was the ultimate definition of what we have been missing from the MCU for so long: feeling, and complexity in characters. This is a movie you don't want to miss."

The trailers looked good, sure, and word of mouth was really hyping this up, so the fact that I went in with decently high expectations and still walked out impressed is saying something. I think my favorite part of this film is how small it feels. It wasn't a huge story that spanned the earth (or space) and ended with a sky beam and a barrage of faceless enemies to punch. It was instead a surprisingly heartfelt story about depression, trauma and guilt. A Phase 5 Marvel movie that actually has something to say? I'm shocked. And pleased. Without spoiling it, we got to a moment where I knew exactly how things would go because it's an MCU movie, but I foresaw a different outcome that would have been more heartfelt and symbolic. But you know what, that's what happened. They actually did it. They subverted my expectations in an amazing way. Throw in great performances, humor that wasn't nearly as MCU-ified as normal, good editing, a handful of practical effects and a killer soundtrack and we might just have one of the best MCU movies we've had in years. I'm not yet sold on the idea that this is the future of the MCU and that every project after this will be clearly focused like this one, but we can hope."

I was not bored for even a second.Let me just say this straight up: Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) is the queen of this movie. Like seriously, she owns every scene she's in. The humor, the sass, the emotion-she's just insane in a good way. I'm telling you, if they don't give her her own solo movie soon, I'm gonna riot (peacefully lol).Red Guardian tho?? David Harbour is a legend. Like I'm not even kidding, his comedic timing is just so good. Every time he shows up, the whole mood lifts. Even the credits scene was funny and made sense. Usually those scenes are just a waste but here it was actually hilarious and clever. Honestly, America is lucky to have David Harbour. We in India need our own David Harbour fr.And omg Bob. Played by Lewis Pullman (I didn't know he was gonna be this good??). As Bob he's super funny but when he switches to Sentry mode it's like... wow. Dude has range. Only thing I'll say is maybe the punching/fight choreography could've been better near the end but whatever-he still nailed the vibe. His storyline lowkey hit me in the feels. That whole \"the darkness inside taking over\" thing was deep. And the ending? Chef's kiss. It wasn't just about punching the bad guy-it was about control and feelings. That group hug scene with everyone saving Bob from himself?? GOOSEBUMPS.Also yeah, Bucky is just very attractive. That's all I'm gonna say.Also also-why are they always messing with John Walker?? Like please just give the man a break lol. Every time he thinks he's doing fine, boom-someone roasts him again. He's literally the junior varsity Cap now.AND I'm hyped for Fantastic Four: First Steps after that end credits tease!! Marvel is cooking again!!9/10 movie. Not perfect but I'm obsessed anyway.

The villain especially was well made, the tiny white eyes and the way bullets just disappeared when shot at him... honestly i couldnt take my eyes off him.

Just don't make a movie about depression then... Every character is a comedian, they're basically all the same person just dressed differently and with different abilities. They're all strong/ fast/ fight like mad but then they all need to come together to hold a small piece of concrete conveniently for the team up shot. The writing is so lazy, it's like it's written with a.i. This seems to be a consistent theme with marvel these days. Phase 1 movies were believable with character development and unique personalities and stories. Now, everyone is just the same character and we are watching the same thing over and over again...they've realised it really can be dumbed down for audiences as people don't seem to expect anything better. Lost person / people, action, comedy relief, action, comedy relief, and so on until characters win. Rehash for next movie."

          "content": "Knowing that this film competes with the elite of superhero movies-where we find, for example, The Dark Knight (and I'm not saying it sits at the same table-that film presides over the table and it's unlikely to be dethroned)-but perhaps it does get close to gems of the genre like Guardians of the Galaxy, Infinity War (I refuse to include Endgame on that list), or X-Men 2.This movie has heart, and that's something not so common in Marvel stories. But beyond that, it conveys a message with soul. The way it treats each of its characters is sublime-it makes use of characters, some already charismatic, and gives them the spotlight they deserve. And they make the most of it with outstanding performances. There is a clear protagonist, but every character-even the silliest one-gets their moment to shine.Maybe it'll feel too short. Maybe it has an abrupt ending that leaves you wanting more. Maybe the pacing will seem too fast. Maybe all that's true-but what's certain is that this is a great movie, with brilliant dialogue and moments that stick in the heart of any viewer-as long as they have a heart. It handles a very important topic with great sensitivity.It's also a film that uses humor to better deliver its message and make it hit even deeper, all wrapped in a clearly defined superhero package with great characters and action scenes. Undoubtedly one of the best of the genre."

Projecting a sense that she is having fun with her role, Julia Louis-Dreyfus dominates every scene in which she appears. By contrast, David Harbour is not as consistently entertaining as he was in BLACK WIDOW. The production values are outstanding, and the villain's superpower is especially menacing. Despite its reported enormous budget, this film seems a little more intimate than many of the outlandish recent MCU entries, which may please some fans while disappointing others."

          "content": "5 out of the 6 stars were given to Florence Pugh (Yelena) for her efforts in good acting. She did a great job in the leading role of this experimental Marvel movie. I truly appreciate that. Indeed her role has quite a few touching moments in which she can successfully show her talent and effort. Marvellous!The core concept is not uncommon: You didn't have a good past + your everyday sucks = you are a total loser; but when the time comes, you will be our hero. OK, this formula works most of the time many action movies. Thunderbolts is no exception.Before watching this movie, the promotion advertisement was in no way interesting to me. Yet since Marvel dared to \"experimentally\" greenlight a movie of such a beta-team, I decided to give it a go. A movie without any superstars and no leading superheros! It's all about the plot and the team's chemical reaction that can decide the fate of this movie. So...The plot is nothing special. Fighting your miserable past/memory and overcome your dark side. Simple as that. And how about the formation and bonding of the team? Any good reasons and explainations? These points are critical and in my opinion, they are just mediocre. I give it a pass and no more than that.Action and CG are typically Marvel standards and budget. Nothing very outstanding here but also nothing disappointing. No thriller, no adrenaline pumping, no jump scare, no tear jerking. Pass, but barely.If you are a Marvel fan and have watched Black Widow, then I would recommend you to watch this. Moderately entertaining. However, I would say it is quite a reasonable sequel to the Black Widow legacy."

I was very nervous but ultimately I loved everything I got from this film, but did it need a little bit more screen time, yes. Did it need more character development and scenes form some people like Bucky, yes. But I can look past those flaws cause I had a terrific time with this movie. It was funny, emotional, dramatic and surprisingly deep. Never knew how much a marvel movie needed to speak on about mental heath, something I struggle with on the daily and I felt seen and heard watching this. Florence Pugh is a perfect example. A fantastic actress who takes Yelena further than she has been already and becomes a new fan favorite for the MCU! Rey if the cast is wonderful. Ghost played by Hannah is one of my new fav marvel female characters, John walker is more likable, and the rest blew me away! And Julia Louis-Dreyfus is as hilarious as ever and makes for a fantastic villain! Same with Lewis Pullman who is a HUNK! Overall the MCU is back and this movie proves it!"

Since Endgame, only Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 comes close in terms of storytelling, and what's even more refreshing is that you don't need to watch ten other movies or series just to understand what's going on. That simplicity is a strength Marvel has been missing lately.One of the biggest problems with recent Marvel films has been their need to overconnect everything. Endless rewrites, reshoots, and forced tie-ins that often strip a movie of its own identity. Thunderbolts, thankfully, avoids all of that. It has its own voice, its own story, and most importantly, its own heart.While I still love movies like Deadpool & Wolverine and Spider-Man: No Way Home, this film doesn't rely on cameos or nostalgia to elevate itself. Instead, it focuses on its characters, telling a grounded story about a group of broken individuals, each dealing with their own insecurities and past mistakes, coming together and finding purpose. That emotional core really works here.The balance between action, humor, and heavy themes is handled well. The comic relief never undermines the more serious moments, which gives the emotional beats space to land.Another big win is how it elevated characters many of us hadn't fully connected with before. John Walker, Ghost, and Yelena all feel more fleshed out, more human. It shows how far good writing and focused storytelling can go in turning side characters into people you genuinely care about.Marvel would do well to learn from this movie. Let stories breathe, give characters depth, and let each film stand on its own. Thunderbolts proves that when you do, the result can be something special."

I thought it'd be a complete joke of a movie just looking at the name. But oh dear was I wrong..Thunderbolts* was a fantastic way to \"start\" Yelena Belova's (Florence Pugh) story in the Marvel Universe. I mean sure, we've seen her in Black Widow and Hawkeye, but this was something new.Following a bunch of anti-heroes for an entire movie was a very interesting move by Marvel. Knowing that all of the \"main/side\" characters had some form of evil backstory and needed redemption. (Especially U. S Agent, who definitely needed to show off some pride after TFATWS).We also got introduced to Bob, (yeah just Bob.) A depressed human that decided to transfer his blood in exchange for superpowers? (Turns out that he becomes the strongest superhero/villain alive.)Bob has two sides, Sentry and The Void (literally Heaven vs Hell), and now needs to fight his loneliness and stop it from literally turning the entire earth into a so called void.This movie was a fun ride that felt incredibly quick considering it being 2 entire hours long, I never got bored of it and really did enjoy every single second.If you're a hardcore Marvel fan, watch the movie. If you've never seen any Marvel film before, watch the movie. You'll love it just as much.Thunderbolts* was amazing. 9/10."

Florence Pugh is excellent at drawing empathy. There was one thing that was done which I disagreed with but I guess it would be considered a spoiler. Let's just say the trailers were abit misleading. Pace of the film starts a little slow but ramps up towards the end. I find this is a common issue when your at the stage of explaining how and why everyone is coming together. That's why sequels gave the luxury of hitting the ground running and getting straight into it (or at least should be). Other than that really enjoyed it. Can't wait for the sequel."

Whether it's the protagonists or the villan. Even if they constantly explain how tragic their story is, their actions don't seem to change, they don't shine or outstand, and most of them end the movie the same way as they started it. The only characters I cared about are Yelena (barely), Sentry, and Bucky. And I found Red Guardian funny too. I wish they had more focus than the other characters.But if there's one thing I'll take from this film is it's message. I really loved the analogy of the shadows: You'll never get rid of your own shadow just like you'll never fully get rid of your traumas and intrusive thoughts, and they want you to fight them, to drain your energy fighting them. The only way to live above them is to recognize you're not alone, as everyone fights them aswell, and that we can always heal each other by just being there for one another. Definetly an example of how a unique message in the genre can help you stand out."

What I got instead was a movie that felt rushed, low on detail, and far from the level of care and attention to detail we're used to in Marvel's earlier phases.The pacing was uneven, the plot felt shallow, and many scenes seemed like they were just filling time rather than moving the story forward. It gave me the sense that the film was made just to connect the dots in the larger MCU rather than stand on its own. There were emotional moments that could have hit hard, but they were brushed over too quickly to make a real impact.That said, Thunderbolts isn't entirely without merit. One thing it gets right is introducing characters. A few underutilized or previously backgrounded characters have their time in the sun here, and though the development is superficial, it's sufficient to pique my interest in their future storylines. This movie may not have been the quality I was expecting, but it did do some groundwork that, if followed up on and executed better in subsequent entries, could be rewarding.Briefly, Thunderbolts was a mixed bag-disappointing in the area of execution, but with a spark of potential that I hope Marvel builds on."

There were no stand out performances by any of the actors. If anything it felt like they were competing to see who could be the most wooden one on the screen. The action sequences were well coreographed but were not enough to carry a movie. Marvel comics were about the characters and their stories. The MCU live action movies have increasingly become nothing more than flash with no substance."

There was virtually no connection between the former Avengers characters and the new crew: it felt disjointed and rushed. The decision to introduce characters like Rob, whose biggest crisis is apparently \"loneliness,\" was baffling.Honestly, the storyline lacked depth, coherence, and emotional weight. It almost felt like the plot was written by a five-year-old trying to recreate the MCU without any real understanding of what made it great to begin with.Disappointing effort from a franchise that used to set the bar."

The plot is actually kind of childish considering \"Bob\" being the focus. There is no real character development because there are too much going on in too little time. The themes and topics that carry over from the TV shows are too shallow to explore anyways. So why couldn't Marvel do something that touches on real human experiences that \"bob\" goes through, why does this movie have to be another team-building episode? In my opinion, this movie can totally be skipped. There is the bare minimum value of watching the fight scenes, otherwise, don't bother a trip to the theaters. 5/10."

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts\" is truly an amazing movie and absolutely worth watching-especially for longtime Marvel fans who have been waiting for something refreshing after Avengers: Endgame. The film brings a strong emotional punch through each of its characters, showing a depth that isn't always easy to achieve in ensemble superhero stories. Every character in this movie brings something unique, whether it's their past, their internal struggles, or the way they grow and interact with each other throughout the film.One of the things I love most is how the storyline feels grounded, yet still delivers the spectacle we've come to expect from the MCU. The plot is filled with emotional weight, action, and unexpected turns. Unlike the typical \"hero vs villain\" formula, Thunderbolts dives deeper into themes like redemption, trust, and the grey area between good and bad. These aren't the traditional squeaky-clean superheroes - they're flawed, complex, and sometimes broken. And that makes their journey all the more compelling.The pacing is well-balanced, with just the right mix of intense action scenes and quieter, emotional moments that let us connect with the characters on a personal level. You can feel the tension building up throughout the movie, and when things finally explode - both emotionally and physically - it hits hard.What makes Thunderbolts special is that it feels like a fresh start for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the climactic ending of Avengers: Endgame, many fans were wondering where the MCU would go next. This movie gives us hope that Marvel still has great stories to tell, with new and returning characters who still have so much potential. It doesn't try to copy past formulas - instead, it creates its own tone while still respecting the bigger Marvel universe.The chemistry between the cast is also something worth highlighting. You can feel the tension, the camaraderie, and even the pain between these characters. The performances are solid, with several standout emotional scenes that truly elevate the film. It's clear that the actors brought their A-game, and the writing gave them the opportunity to explore their roles in depth.Visually, the movie delivers the expected Marvel quality - from the cinematography to the special effects, everything looks stunning. But even more impressive is how those visuals serve the story, instead of overshadowing it. The action is cool, but it's the emotional journey and character development that left a lasting impression on me.I also appreciate the direction Marvel seems to be heading in - focusing on character-driven narratives with more emotional stakes. It's a smart move, especially in a time when fans want more than just explosive battles. They want meaning. They want heart. And Thunderbolts has plenty of that.With Thunderbolts, I feel like Marvel has found its footing again, and I'm really excited for what's coming next. I can't wait to see Fantastic Four in July. If it continues the momentum and quality shown in this movie, I believe we're in for something truly special. I hope Marvel keeps building on this success, delivering more surprises, emotional depth, and powerful storytelling.In conclusion, Thunderbolts is more than just another Marvel movie - it's a statement that the MCU still has plenty of life, energy, and stories left to tell. A bold, emotional, and thrilling ride that redefines what it means to be a Marvel team.Thank you, Marvel, for giving us this powerful chapter - and here's to more in the future!"

          "content": "My review is not the answer. Please remember that individual appreciation should be respected in itself, and this is one of many and many appreciation.I'd appreciate it if you could consider this review that focuses on which part was \"hate\" and why it was \"hate\"!A rating of 6/101. Story\nThe story was explained very well by Mutting, so I won't write it separately. I felt almost everything you felt about the story, and I think the sentence of moderate humor and comedy was appropriate.2. Action\nIn terms of action, I think it was pretty good. This movie focused on \"emotion\" rather than action, so there wasn't that much action, but there didn't seem to be much intrusive.3. Comparison with the trailer\nIf you put together all the trailers that have been released so far, I think it's like watching 90% of this movie. I don't think you'll have any trouble understanding this movie just by looking at the trailers.4. Characters\nI thought this movie focused on 'emptiness (feeling)' and 'dark past'. I will tell you the contents of each character and what I was disappointed about each character.A. Elena\nOut of all the characters in the movie, I thought they were the ones who showed \"emptiness\" and \"dark past\" the best. The fact that they had to kill \"Anya\" as the first mission of the Red Room. The cruel scene where the other trainees were whipped when they won the gun assembly competition. I thought that the movie was starring Yelena only and the rest were supporting actors.B. Winter Soldier\nIn fact, Winter Soldier's \"Feeling\" and \"The Dark Past\" seem to have moved on quickly because they have been shown in many works.C. US Agent\nThe keyword \"fallen\" was the first thing Walker thought of. The fact that he killed a citizen in \"Falcon and Winter Soldier\" and was fired in \"Captain America\" did not disappear from his mind when he started a family and had children. Eventually, his wife left him with their children. When Walker joined hands with Bob, his \"emptiness\" he saw could be seen in the keyword \"fallen hero,\" as the title of the news article says. Walker's behavior cannot be justified, but his emptiness was pitiful.D. Red Guardian & Ghost\nIn fact, the two \"emptiness\" and \"dark past\" were not covered in detail in the movie. In the case of Ghost, you can only see that he grew up in an experimental facility when he was young, but the Red Guardian could not find such a content. Since the movie revolves around the narratives of Yelena and Bob, I don't think the two narratives were dealt with much, but I personally left a regret that it would have been nice to show their narratives in a brief scene like Walker in consideration of those who are new to the movie.You can probably expect it to be due to a lot of characters and a short running time.E. Taskmaster\nPeople who were interested in the movie predicted, \"The taskmaster is going to die.\" \"The taskmaster is going to be killed in the beginning by the centree.\"\nThis prediction is half right and half wrong. Exactly when the mercenaries fight and Bob first appears, he is shot in the head by Ghost. I was so dumbfounded when I saw this. I thought to myself, \"What the heck is this...,\" and I don't know why they showed their faces and made them come out as characters. If he had died quickly in front of Sentry's powerful power, he would have called it a \"combatant force meter\" and left, but I personally thought it would not be right for him to be shot and killed by a \"ghost\" without even fighting. If the \"Task Master\" was the first scene to face Sentry at the Avengers Tower and run into him first and was horrified, I think carefully that Sentry's strength could have been expressed more directly.The \"Task Master\" was a main villain in \"Black Widow,\" but this exit was not good for me personally. I think he was the \"Task Master\" who was criticized a lot for his performance in \"Black Widow\" and his short running time made him leave quickly. Nevertheless, it was too fast and too vain.F. Sentry\nWhen I first showed Bob's first appearance and sentry skills, I thought it was okay. Sentry's suit look in the middle was a little awkward, so I didn't think it looked good on him. In the latter part of \"Void,\" I watched it in the trailer to some extent, so I thought the scene where \"Void\" and \"Bob\" fight inside was a bit complicated. Boyd tries to swallow Bob, saying, \"We're always alone,\" while overpowering Bob and Thunderbolts. But what's regrettable here is how to stop this. Among the Thunderbolts that were overpowered, Yelena runs to Bob first and gives him a hug. She gives him a cliché sentence, saying, \"You're not alone,\" while giving him a hug. But what I personally felt sorry about here was that the other members ran to him and hugged him. I understand what Mutting's sentence, \"The ending in which a real hero is born only when you hug each other's empty space,\" means when you watched the movie, but I think you only saw it from a negative perspective at the time when you watched it.In fact, my personal position in this area is that in order to convey 'emotion' and 'message', a detailed narrative about it must be supported. I also think you have to be close to that character in order to immerse yourself in the character. The first and middle parts of the movie were evaluated quite well while watching, but the short running time of the movie was not appropriate to capture this 'emotion' in the second half. Personally, if this work came out as a drama, I would have been able to express the narrative and emotions of each character better.5."

This isn't just a superhero story-it's a beautifully raw exploration of identity and purpose."

The very definition of what makes a film feel complete is constantly shifting-and unfortunately, this one feels more like a setup than a self-contained story. It's disappointing to see something with so much potential reduced to a single movie, instead of which it feels like a glorified first episode of a larger series. As a result, it lacks the weight and satisfaction a movie should deliver on its own. While the characters and concept clearly hold potential, the execution falls flat. There's no emotional payoff, no satisfying arc-just setups and teases. It's ridiculous to consider this a finished product when it seems more like an introduction to something we might care about later. Marvel seems to be increasingly relying on the assumption that fans will stay invested no matter what. But without giving the audience a fulfilling experience in the moment, they're risking fatigue-and Thunderbolts might be a casualty of that trend."

          "content": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been lackluster since the epic battle in \"Avengers: Endgame.\" There has been an online discussion about how fans have been eager for the next chapter, yet the post-Endgame films have been mixed-some are even disasters. While some MCU entries dazzle with the multiverse and celestial stakes, the franchise is weighed down by convoluted and chaotic plots or a string of new characters struggling to find their footing. Then comes Thunderbolts*, a film that breathes new life into the MCU by putting the characters front and center. Highlighting more about the soul of the characters and less about spectacle might just be what the franchise needs for a fresh start.Thunderbolts* introduces us to a ragtag team of antiheroes and misunderstood figures who campaign to become the \"new Avengers*.\" The film follows the misfits-Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen), and the ever-charming Bob (Lewis Pullman)-who are far from our typical all-American superheroes, these characters are flawed, complicated, and deeply human. They are not just a team assembled to fight a powerful villain; each character arrives with their own emotional baggage, motivations, and personal demons to fight with. The film's biggest win lies in its writing and characterization. It's a superhero story that feels intimate, almost indie in its approach, focusing on the humane side of the superheroes. Instead of highlighting their intimidating superpower or having side characters as plot devices, the film focuses on who these people are beneath the masks and powers they possess. The characters don't feel like archetypes; they feel like real people you could meet on the streets-people with deep emotional wounds, hopes, regrets, and doubts.In all its ways, Thunderbolts* feels like a passing of the torch. The former Avengers have largely stepped back, and this new team is poised to take their place, not because they fit a mold, but because they represent something more complex and nuanced, which has been missing in the post-Endgame MCU films. These are the heroes with messy parts, trying to find their way in a world that doesn't quite trust them.If you're like me and crave an MCU film that invests in character arcs as much as it does in action sequences and complex multiverse tropes, Thunderbolts excels. Each character has a complete storyline, yet leaves room for future development. Yelena is struggling with loss and identity; Bucky carries the weight of his past as the Winter Soldier; Red Guardian faces his struggles with family and legacy; and John Walker is grappling with his role as a sanctioned hero. Bob or The Sentry/Void added a unique flavor, bringing elements of vulnerability, depth, and humor that balance the darker tone of his character.What's remarkable is how the film injects depth into these characters without ever sacrificing the pacing or excitement. The arcs are poignant and relatable, where you'll find yourself caring about their journeys and rooting for their growth and redemption. Of course, it wouldn't be a superhero film without the villain, but even the \"villain\" is handled with nuance. Instead of a cardboard cutout antagonist, the film offers a character who fits into the larger MCU puzzle pieces, hinting at an evolving narrative. This subtlety makes the conflict feel organic rather than forced.There's no denying that Florence Pugh is \"THAT\" girl. Her performance was undeniably the film's emotional core. Acting alongside her is David Harbour, who played Flo's father; their portrayal of a fractured, complicated father-daughter relationship adds another layer of raw emotion, which is seldom seen in a superhero film. The dynamics between their characters are a standout, filled with hilarious, touching, and painful moments. The film does not shy away from exploring the themes of trauma, loneliness, and the longing for connection. These aren't just throwaway lines or backstory elements; they're woven perfectly into the fabric of the characters and the narrative. The honesty in their interactions gives the film a surprising emotional weight, grounding the fantastical elements in a real human experience.The previous MCU releases have had issues with the writing, making their characters look like caricatures in their own film. Take \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" as an example, where the film solely relies on silly jokes or forced humor to defuse profound moments. Instead, in Thunderbolts*, the humor respects the gravity of its themes-trauma, redemption, trust, and identity-while still delivering moments of levity that feel earned and natural.If the DC Universe's *Suicide Squad* leaned into chaotic antihero antics with a wild, almost manic energy, Thunderbolts* might be described as the \"Depressed Squad.\" The film embraces the imperfections and vulnerabilities of its characters rather than glossing over them. This grounded approach makes the stakes feel more personal and the characters more relatable.The film doesn't fall into the trap of overcomplicating its story with multiverse chaos or quantum physics jargon, which is refreshing after the disastrous \"Captain America: Brave New World.\" If you binge-watch all of the MCU films, it will blow your mind, not because of the spectacle but because you'll spend a lot of time untangling alternate realities and timelines. Thunderbolts* offers a welcome return to straightforward storytelling. They finally understood what the audiences really want-strong writing and compelling characters. It's a simple reminder that it's not about grandiose spectacle or mind-bending concepts; it's about the characters and their journeys.It's pretty common in superhero films to suffer from predictability-heroes facing a powerful villain, overcoming all of the odds in expected ways to save the world. Thunderbolts* shakes up this formula. The characters are so richly drawn and morally complex, leaving you wondering how they'll behave in a heightened situation. This unpredictability adds a layer of tension and intrigue that keeps you engaged throughout. It's very rare to watch a superhero film where the protagonists' decisions and reactions feel authentic and grounded.Thunderbolts* is a bold, character-driven film that signals a new direction for the MCU. It proves that MCU doesn't need another sprawling multiverse saga or cosmic event to captivate audiences. Instead, it needs stories with heart, characters with depth, and themes that resonate on a human level. By focusing on flawed, complex heroes who are as relatable as they are powerful, Thunderbolts* offers a new kind of superhero film that feels fresh and necessary. Thunderbolts* is a welcome reminder of what makes the genre great: compelling characters, meaningful stories, and the courage to be vulnerable even when wearing a mask.If this is the future of the MCU, count me in."

I'll just add the other Marvel projects that this is in line with: Loki (both seasons), Thor (all 4), Deadpool (all 3), Avengers (all 4), Ant Man (2 & 3), Dr. Strange (1 & 2), Black Panther (part 1), and all X-Men Movies (including Wolverine movies). If you like those, you will enjoy Thunderbolts."

The last few entries have felt kind of messy, and overstuffed. But Thunderbolts actually surprised me. It's not perfect, but it feels like Marvel might finally be listening.A Marvel film that fights depression and mental health is a nice spin. You rarely find a good film or show that deals with mental health, trauma, or addiction these days.Now, it's not a total reinvention of the wheel. There are still a few pacing issues and it doesn't completely shake the Marvel formula. But it does feel like a course correction. It feels like Marvel is finally ready to take risks again and move away from the bloated spectacle.If you've been disappointed by recent Marvel movies, give this one a shot."

Each one, found at their lowest point, works through their personal trauma to help a person in need, inadvertently finding their own purpose in life and giving hope to the world.This latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe examines broken characters. It introduces one who does not fit the classic superhero archetype. The story shares the dark parts of these characters after their introduction into the universe, their struggles, emotions, mental state, and humanity. While the story seems dark, the movie does a great job keeping it light with comedy and action. Having past knowledge of these characters will help you fully appreciate this movie, but it is not required to enjoy it. This movie may not be what fans of the MCU are waiting for, but it does foreshadow what's to come to an extent. Overall, not a standard Marvel movie, fans should catch it on the big screen, and casual watchers might want to stream it."

          "content": "I liked it more than Captain America, though I wouldn't call it a masterpiece like some are claiming. From the first trailer, it caught my attention-I thought, \"This feels like it could be Marvel's answer to James Gunn's Suicide Squad,\" and I wasn't wrong. The funny thing is, Marvel went with a relatively unknown director, Jake Schreier (first time I've heard of him), and it's clear they used the budget wisely because the film looks fantastic.This \"Avengers\"-style team is made up of Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Ava Starr / Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), and Antonia Dreykov (Olga Kurylenko). They all work as mercenaries for Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), who, after clashing with the government, decides to cut them loose as \"loose ends.\" Thus, the Thunderbolts are born.What didn't work for me was the overuse of jokes. The humor lands, sure, but there are moments where it feels excessive-especially with Red Guardian, and to a lesser extent, Valentina and her assistant, who come off as cartoonish. They should've dialed that back.On the other hand, the cast is solid, with strong performances across the board. Yelena stands out as the clear protagonist-she's the soul of the movie, and everything revolves around her. The cinematography is top-tier (I loved it), and the fight scenes are fluid and well-choreographed, without jarring cuts. The action sequences are brilliantly executed, and I appreciated the heavier reliance on practical effects over CGI.Another highlight? The villain. Finally, we get one with real motives and a compelling backstory. You even empathize with them-their arc delivers a powerful message about loneliness and depression.The ending also won me over, thanks to a well-crafted script. The only misstep is Valentina and her assistant. Otherwise, the film never drags; the two hours fly by, and I left the theater happy. Good job, Marvel-it was about time.In short: More spark than solemnity, more soul than formula. Thunderbolts doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it revitalizes the genre. Yes, it's overly quippy, but it's also got heart, style, and a villain with depth. Yelena shines, the cast delivers, the action thrills, and the pacing never falters. Marvel, at last, feels alive again."

          "content": "Hunderbolts transcends its baseline story by delivering a surprisingly realistic and poignant exploration of the depression andmental illness of the lead characters, and the ways they hold themselves together. What makes it stand out isn't the battles or the obligatory \"team of misfits learning to work together\" arc-something Guardians of the Galaxy already perfected. The group's powers and firing skills could do nothing against their rivals, either the super powered Sentry or the super manipulative polatition Valentino. Instead the the empathy that Florence Pue's Natasha builds with the Sentry that wins the day.On paper, Thunderbolts looks like yet another entry in the crowded \"broken team comes together and saves the world\" category. You can't help but think of other takes on this formula, from the terrific Birds of Prey to the awful Suicide Squad (from which Birds was technically a sequel). Thunderbolts never reaches the pure bonkers, girl power energy of Birds or the completeness of Guardians, but it does something those movies rarely do: it lingers. It takes its time with the emotional damage of its characters, making their struggles feel heavier, more real, and less like obligatory backstory. Funny, fast-paced, and unexpectedly moving, Thunderbolts is a welcome 2025 return to form for Marvel."

The literal main villain of the story is the personification of manic depression. The marketing of the movie is genius, of naming the movie the \"Thunderbolts*\" and revealing the actual title of \"*The New Avengers.\" This movie absolutely lives up to the legacy the first Avengers movie left and provides a sense of nostalgia, but doesn't feel like a remake. It's one of the first marvel movies I genuinely believe is a 10/10."

          "content": "Whilst I haven't been as down on Marvel's post-Endgame output as some others, I do feel like what has been missing is a sense of overall direction and focus. Instead of feeling like a series of movies telling one larger story, they've felt individualised and occasionally like their seeding stories that won't ever be capitalised on. This is to say whilst I don't think \"Thunderbolts*\" is as good as the last \"Spider-man\" movie or \"GOTG3\" it does, at last, recapture some of that feeling.With the government circling, looking for evidence of wrongdoing, Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) starts to eliminate the loose ends of her OXE group. This includes its agents of questionable past, so Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) and Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) are all sent to a facility with the instruction to terminate one another. Instead, the learn of their objectives, and whilst rescuing the unassuming Bob (Lewis Pullman) decide to band together to get revenge on Valentina.Writing a lot of the smaller wrongs is probably the best way to think about \"Thunderbolts\". Practical effects, including explosions and that initial dive off the tower are improvements. For the most part the film is concerned about its own story - with a strong central theme of battling against depression both earned and clinical, that works for a lot of the characters involved, particularly the films central pairing of Yelena and Bob. It does build on aspects of the past though, we finally learn who bought Avengers tower, and why and what Valenta has been doing with the characters we've seen her gather together over the last few years. It also builds a new and fascinating paradigm within the MCU, one so central to it that it has to be a factor going forward - if you've managed to avoid what I'm talking about, then I won't spoil it here.It's maybe a little more lowkey than I was expecting. Not all villains can be punched into submission and I like that this wasn't the plan here, but a more psychological and maybe even realistic ending is reached.I'm intrigued as to where some of these characters go, going forward, but I'm happy that this feels like an unqualified step in the right direction."

David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, and Sebastian Stan bring grit, humor, and pathos, rounding out a team that feels grounded in trauma, not just superpowers.The film's tone is refreshingly bleak yet intimate, exploring themes of redemption, mental illness, and identity. Schreier's direction leans more into psychological thriller than action blockbuster, and while some may miss the traditional MCU gloss, others will find it a welcome evolution.With subtle cinematography, a haunting score, and surprisingly emotional arcs, Thunderbolts marks a turning point in Marvel's storytelling-less about saving the world, and more about saving what's left of themselves."

The thing is with Marvel, whenever they do something a little left field, it usually hits home, and this is the most left field film they have released in a longtime.I honestly thought that when this was announced, it would be nothing more than Marvels Suicide Squad, but it's so much more than that. By the way, I love Marvel and DC equally.This is a dark film about losing yourself into mental health, and letting it take over you, because it's so very easy to do. Why should you fight to be normal, when mental health could deceive you into thinking that you are unique? That's the problem with Bob, who is the films foundation. He has nothing, no one cares about him until it's too late, so why shouldn't he listen to the devil on his shoulder?It starts off very slowly, the first act is a little bit of a slog, but when it turns itself on its head, it becomes one of the darkest films that Marvel has released thus far.There is even a scene that rivals the squeaky little shoe scene in Roger rabbit.But also, there is a scene where the titular group fight a chicken, so the humour is still there.It won't change you view on superhero films, but it's refreshing to see this genre do something a little different, and it shows that Marvel has life in it yet....."

It was so average, so dull, so emotionless, so flat, that when I left the cinema I threw away my plans to go home and eat my salad and went straight to nearest fast food to swallow the most average burger with fries and a coke of course. Only that could match the vibrations this experience left on my soul.Was it a bad movie? Not really, but neither a good one.I know nothing about the Marvel universe, I just saw the title \"thunderbolts*\" and bought a ticket to witness.I tell you right away: there is no reason to discuss the plot, the direction, photography, the actors, etc... by tomorrow, you'll have already forgotten everything."

I really enjoyed the psychological depth and was caught off guard by how funny it was. The character interactions were a highlight-they felt real and added a lot to the story. I also appreciated that the cinematography supported the narrative without overshadowing it. The action scenes were solid, but what stood out most was the film's focus on real mental health themes. It was simple yet effective, and as someone in a career involving counseling, I truly appreciated the thoughtful and respectful way those themes were handled. I think they did a great job in execution-it was both entertaining and reflective. I want to see more movies like this-in fact, I liked it so much that I made an account just to rate and review it."

I totally Ship Yelena and Bob. Bob was such an amazing Character. I loved it at the end when the Thunderbolts went through Bob's past, and in the last memory scene, they all came together and had a group hug at the end of the movie. This movie had just the right amount of action and just enough emotion. I also loved the beginning of the movie when John, Ava, Yelena, and Taskmaster fought each other. I loved the Message behind the movie, which is that people are there for you to talk to and help you through depression."

Always been fond of the red guardian, such a fun character, greatly played by David Harbour. Florence Pugh also portrayed a great role.

the fight sequences are well-choreographed; The direction on a microscale is better for a Marvel movie as these characters really do share their emotions in the interpersonal scenes; this makes you really empathize with their struggles; The storytelling is pretty standard for a Marvel action-comedy movie; They build tension better than most Marvel movies; nothing extremely noteworthyStory - Pretty Good:\nThe concept is very dark for a Marvel film, as it is about these rejected Marvel characters and properties finding purpose as they try to escape this void growing in their lives; The plot structure is pretty linear; Character writing is very good for a Marvel movie, as it deals with depression and finding purpose for all these rejected characters in the MCU, the problem is that all these characters are from throwaway properties in the MCU post-Endgame, so it is really hard to care for them despite the depth they are givenScreenplay - Pretty Good to Good:\nThe dialogue is pretty strong and flows well, especially for a Marvel movie;

          "content": "I'll be honest and say that most entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after Spider-Man: No Way Home have been either average or naff (not rubbish, just meh!), so I hoped this latest instalment could be the one to get things back on track, directed by Jake Schreier (Robot & Frank, Paper Towns). Basically, in Malaysia, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), who was trained as a Black Widow assassin, destroys a laboratory. This mission was on behalf of CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to cover up her involvement with the O. X. E. Group's \"Sentry\" superhuman project. As Vallentina faces imminent impeachment for her work with O. X. E. Group, she sends Yelena on a mission to a covert O. X. E. Facility where there are supposed to be thieves. Yelena is confronted by John Walker aka Captain America (Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn), former successor to Steve Rogers, Ava Starr aka Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), and Antonia Dreykov aka Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko). In the ensuing fight, Ava kills Taskmaster and a mysterious man named Bob Reynolds (Lewis Pullman, Bill's son) is released from a suspended animation pod in the room. As they stop fighting, they realise they have all been sent by Vallentina under false pretences. They have been trapped to be incinerated along with evidence of Vallentina's misconduct. They manage to work together and escape from the trap. Vallentina learns that the group has survived, including Bob, who was presumed dead during the Sentry trials. When she arrives at the site, Bob creates a diversion, allowing Yelena, Walker, and Ava to escape. Bob draws enemy fire but sustains no injuries despite being shot. He then uncontrollably ascends into the air before passing out and crashing back at the compound. He is captured and taken to the former Avengers Tower in Manhattan, now renamed the \"Watchtower\". Vallentina intends to introduce Bob to the press as a super-powered protector like the Avengers, hoping the PR stunt will avert her impeachment. Yelena, Walker, and Ava are rescued by Alexei Shostakov aka Red Guardian (David Harbour), who overheard details of Vallentina's plot while working as a freelance chauffeur. Inspired by Yelena's childhood soccer team, Alexei refers to the group as the \"Thunderbolts\". Vallentina's agents pursue the Thunderbolts before they are ultimately apprehended by Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), formerly the Winter Soldier, who intends to have them testify in the impeachment proceedings. Upon learning that Bob was a subject of one of Vallentina's top-secret experiments, Barnes joins the group as they make their way to New York. Confronting Vallentina infiltrating the Watchtower, the Thunderbolts discover that she has convinced Bob to join her side as a new superhero; she plans to market him as a replacement for the Avengers called the Sentry. Sentry easily overpowers the team and forces them to retreat, but then he develops a god-like delusion of superiority, turning on Vallentina. Sentry is incapacitated by Vallentina's assistant, Mel (Geraldine Viswanathan), with a failsafe kill switch. This triggers the emergence of the Void, Bob's destructive alter ego and the embodiment of his depression and insecurities created because of the procedure and his fractured psyche. This results in New York City slowly being engulfed in supernatural darkness, causing people to vanish and become trapped in pocket dimensions based on their worst memories. Realising the only way to stop the Void is from within, Yelena enters the darkness to reach Bob's consciousness. There, she faces her haunted past as a Black Widow and finds Bob hiding in a recreation of his childhood bedroom, where his father abused him. The other Thunderbolts follow, and together they travel back to the memory of Bob's initial experimentation, where he volunteered for the procedure, hoping to improve himself after becoming an aimless drug addict. The Thunderbolts confront the Void but are swiftly overpowered. As the Void threatens to fully consume Bob, the team intervenes, affirming that they believe in him. Their solidarity empowers Bob to regain control, and he and the group return to the city with normality restored. With the threat neutralised, the Thunderbolts prepare to apprehend Vallentina. However, she manipulates public perception by staging a press conference, introducing them to the public as the New Avengers (this is the reason for the asterisk in the title). The Thunderbolts go along with this, but Yelena threatens to expose Vallentina if she betrays them again. In a post-credits scene, the New Avengers and Bob discuss Captain America's intent to sue the team for trademark infringement. Then they receive a distress signal from an extradimensional spacecraft with a large \"4\" emblem (The Fantastic Four). Also starring Wendell Pierce as Congressman Gary, True Blood's Chris Bauer as Holt, Violet McGraw as Young Yelena, Alexa Swinton (Tilda's cousin) as Anya, Chiara Stella as Young Valentina, Stefano Carannante as Valentina's Father, Gabrielle Byndloss as Olivia Walker, Clayton Cooper as Young Bob, Joshua Mikel as Bob's Dad, and Molly Carden as Bob's Mom. Pugh makes a good leading action star, Russell with his one-liners, Harbour being the comic relief and Stan being stone-faced are good support, Pullman has his moments, and Louis-Dreyfus has fun being the manipulative villain. This film is a better, more rounded story and works on character plot; it doesn't overdo the special effects and explosions until it needs to, it still maintains moments of humour, and it is surprisingly darker in the third half. I found it exciting and interesting, it is an improvement and the comeback the franchise needs, an enjoyable superhero fantasy action. Very good!"

What stood out to me most were the characters, particularly Bob and Yelena. I think they're well-written and have great chemistry. Red Guardian, too, is an absolute scene-stealer. I also appreciated how the story was structured, especially how the main characters are brought together. The film also has a pleasant sense of humor.That said, a few things did bother me. First of all, apparently no one in this movie knows how to shoot straight. Sure, action films are rarely realistic, but in this case it was so exaggerated that it became distracting.I was also disappointed with the second half and the ending. At a certain point, the plot just becomes ridiculous. Things happen without any real setup or explanation, and as a viewer, you're expected to just accept it without understanding how or why. The way they defeat the villain honestly felt like something out of a kids' cartoon.Still, I had a good time watching it. But I'm not sure this team should really be the next Avengers."

          "content": "Upon my initial watch I felt like the first half to two thirds of the movie was a little slow. As someone who is a fan of Sentry in the comics, and who followed the promotional material for the movie, it felt like a lot of build up to something we knew was going to happen. I have to say that I also initially felt that the Sentry/Void arc lost something in translation to the screen.However, I think the changes that were made to the Sentry's (played with nuance, wit and charm by Lewis Pullman) backstory, the biggest of which being the change from schizophrenia to bipolar disorder, were instrumental in telling a story, and exploring themes that are much deserved to be explored in mainstream \"blockbuster\" filmmaking, as opposed to being relegated solely to indie dramas. Florence Pugh's Yelena is excellently portrayed and serves as a perfect complementary character to Pullman's Bob as she continues to struggle with meaning and purpose after the loss of her sister and accepting (in Hawkeye) that there is no one to blame and exact revenge on.This is a Marvel superhero movie that introduces one of the strongest heroes in marvel lore and at the same time uses its final act to acknowledge that you can't punch your way out of all your problems, and in fact, in trying to do so, you'll only lose what you have left of yourself. This is a superhero movie that acknowledges that needing support, and accepting support from others is not a weakness, but a strength.This is a movie that continues Marvel's Disney+ series trend of exploring more emotional themes and complex subject matter, Wandavision having explored grief and loss and the effect it can have on those around us, and Moonknight having explored childhood trauma and the strength that someone who feels broken can find when they embrace all of the pieces of themselves. It isn't that Marvel have always shied away from emotional subject matter in their movie releases, some of their best films have had very emotional subtext, the Guardians movies and Wakanda Forever being possibly the best examples of this, but it's refreshing to see a real, vulnerable emotional core built into a big budget movie.Wyatt Russel gets only a little bit more to do as John Walker (looking much less like the old man from Up than he did in Falcon and Winter Soldier) but enough more to do to bring out the more likeable and relatable aspects that Russel can portray on screen, allowing his character to be a dick, but a much more likeable dick than in previous iterations.Hannah John Kamen has potentially the least emotional work to do, but I really enjoyed her character from Ant-man and The Wasp, and she has more fun stuff to do here. David Harbour is in good form here, mostly being used as comic relief, but also providing some emotional reinforcement for the main lead. Sebastian Stan fills out the cast mostly looking moderately disappointed with everything that is going on around him.I also felt that this movie had possibly the best soundtrack of any marvel movie to date, and I hope that we get more of the themes from this movie in the following Avengers movies."

          "content": "Thunderbolts is one of those films that walks the fine line between being just good enough and almost amazing. I went in expecting a darker, more grounded twist on the Marvel formula-and while it delivers in parts, it doesn't fully commit to its potential. Still, I found myself enjoying the ride, even if the storm didn't hit as hard as it could have.Acting:\nThe cast is where Thunderbolts shines most. Each performer brings a distinctive flavor to their morally gray character. Florence Pugh continues to own every frame as Yelena-her charisma and emotional depth are the film's pulse. Sebastian Stan's Bucky carries a brooding calm that contrasts well with the chaos around him. David Harbour provides the humor, and while not all the jokes land, he humanizes the team when things get too grim. Some of the supporting cast feel underused, but the ensemble has chemistry that hints at what could've been a more dynamic character study.Cinematography:\nVisually, Thunderbolts sticks to the gritty, shadow-toned palette you'd expect from a team of anti-heroes. The camera work is confident, especially in close-up combat scenes where tension and movement are emphasized. Still, it doesn't quite push boundaries-stylistically it feels more like a side chapter than a cinematic centerpiece. That said, a few wide shots (especially those set in urban decay or icy backdrops) stood out for their moody composition.CGI & Action Sequences:\nThe CGI is solid overall. Nothing groundbreaking, but no glaring flaws either. The action choreography is tight and practical where it counts-fewer giant sky beams, more boots on the ground. I appreciated that. There's weight to the hits and a rawness in the hand-to-hand combat that suits the tone of the story. Some larger set pieces felt slightly over-polished, but they never broke immersion.Music & Sound Design:\nThe score does its job, adding tension where needed, but it doesn't leave a lasting impression. I wouldn't say I walked out humming any themes, but the ambient tones supported the bleak energy of the plot. Sound design during the fight scenes was punchy and immersive, especially in enclosed or claustrophobic environments.Story & Themes:\nNarratively, Thunderbolts juggles a lot-trauma, redemption, betrayal-but it doesn't always go deep enough. The characters have scars, but the script tends to scratch the surface rather than dig in. Still, there's a clear attempt to explore what makes someone a \"hero\" versus a weapon, and I respect that. The pacing drags in the second act, but the third pulls it back together, even if it ends a little too neatly for such a morally messy crew.Overall:\nThunderbolts is a good movie with flashes of greatness. It sets the stage for more layered storytelling in the MCU, but stops just short of breaking the mold. As someone who appreciates stories that let flawed characters breathe, I found enough here to enjoy-but I also left wishing it had gone further. Still, a 7/10 feels fair. It's not thunderous, but it's definitely a rumble worth hearing."

It's a film that trades spectacle for sincerity, and for the most part, it works.The character arcs are the true powerhouses here. Yelena shines with a layered performance that explores grief and responsibility. Bob's story brings unexpected heart, while the supporting cast carries emotional scars that feel authentic and earned. It's refreshing to see a Marvel movie that puts trauma and vulnerability front and center instead of just using them as plot devices.Not every character is given their moment, though. Taskmaster, for example, is literally taken out in the first ten minutes-a headshot that felt more like a punchline than a plot twist. Guess Marvel really said, \"Tasks? She's done.\" It's a moment so abrupt it borders on parody, and fans of the character may find it more frustrating than funny.The film's biggest weakness, though, is its villain. Allegra Valentina Di Fontaine lacks the menace or complexity needed to match the emotional weight of the heroes. Her scenes feel obligatory, and she never quite rises above Marvel's increasingly familiar mold of bureaucratic manipulators.Visually and structurally, the movie leans into familiar MCU tropes, especially in the third act. While the first two-thirds aim for nuance, the finale swerves back into safe territory, opting for a predictable resolution instead of a bold payoff.Overall, Thunderbolts is a strong standalone film with meaningful themes and compelling characters. But as a Marvel movie, it feels a bit restrained-good, not great. It's not quite a thunderclap, but it's definitely a rumble worth hearing.Rating: 7.8/10 - A grounded, emotionally rich film that soars on character work but stumbles on villainy and formula."

          "content": "Not only did it not suck, but it was one of my favorite MCU movies. The team dynamic was fun and didn't feel forced at all. Each member is a damaged broken person. Some were made into weapons by monsters and others just wanted to do good and lost their way. Some may argue with me on this, but this was the humor from phase 1 that sometimes felt forced and really not that funny, but when it did hit I laughed. Florence Pugh is a star that naturally steals scenes, but the others didn't let it happen long. I was happy to see John Walker get redemption, because I thought he was one of the only good things from Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Sam and Bucky were great also, but Walker was done dirty. He killed people so he's ruined never mind the fact the terrorist he killed was part of the group that just killed his friend and American soldier. It's like they forgot Steve Rogers didn't kill anyone. I don't want to say too much more so I don't ruin anything. So if you're like me and you really have not been crazy about any marvel movies in a long time go see this one. It's fun, well written,\ngreat cast, great character writing, and entertaining."

Personally I like Ghost and Taskmaster who could have used further redemption arcs. None here. One is wasted and the other is literally wasted.The \"villain\" is too cartoonish for even a comic book film. He's no real threat throughout. Everyone he \"kills\" is returned unharmed. In the end is defeated by a group hug. Rewatch 1 thru 23 and hope DisMarvel finally gets it."

Better than it has any right to be.I don't know but it feels like this is a marvel film that tries it's hardest to be a good film. And I think it succeeds. I'm really in the rollercoaster right now having just seen it. But there were several memorable scenes in it. I think it did things that were clever. I loved parts of the film and related quite strongly to the characters. Maybe that's the goal of a good marvel film. This one just succeeded. And I will talk more about it. I think it's underrated, Flying under the radar. Touches on perfectly with conversations of mental health that I just didn't anticipate. You'd think a marvel film would butcher the dialogue and messages when trying to tackle such subject matters. But this one didn't. Not at all. It succeeded. This surprised and enthralled me. And was very tone appropriate considering the subject matter. But not just the tone. The dialogue was spot on. If you know a bit about mental health and have your own struggles and mental torment, just watch it, you will get something out of this too. Not excessively boring like joker2019 but what was here I found powerful and just a blast. I wish I could give it a 9/10 but I don't think I can do that yet. Not till the dust has settled.

          "content": "Thunderbolts doesn't feel like a typical Marvel movie - and thank god for that!In a franchise that's somewhat been spinning its wheels post-Endgame, Thunderbolts arrives like a gut punch and a breath of fresh air all at once. It trades quips and CGI noise for something messier, more character-focused, and deeply human. It is, in many ways, different from other MCU films that have come before it, and that freshness couldn't have arrived at a more opportune time, when the franchise is in need of new blood and direction. Thunderbolts bursts onto the Marvel scene with a distinct vibe and genuine voice, crafting a dynamic mosaic of character-driven storytelling that feels... real.This is Marvel's most emotionally grounded film in years - maybe ever. It's raw. It's vulnerable. It's about trauma, grief, depression, and the exhausting search for purpose when you've already been written off. It's some of Marvel's darkest material to date, dealing with the emotional wreckage of broken individuals grappling with their pasts and finding camaraderie amidst the emptiness of their lives.I truly haven't felt this giddy leaving an MCU movie in years! Thunderbolts is fantastic - a Phase One-style character piece about finding fulfillment, embracing our demons, and the support system needed to save us from the pull of the void. It's a witty, mature, singular vision from Jake Schreier. It plays like a spiritual sequel to James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, brimming with heart and sincerity, trading out the space opera for ground-level group therapy.It surprised me with how much it prioritizes character. The action is strong, but what really resonated was getting into these characters' inner workings, breaking them down a bit, and seeing where they end up. The emotional, character-based stakes worked beautifully - with a mature handling of its themes that never undercuts serious moments with a joke. That said, it's still very funny in clever, witty ways that make sense for the characters. The spectacle and humour are all character-driven, which is why the film works as well as it does.And I gotta say, it is so refreshing to see a superhero blockbuster that puts emotion over action but still knows how to create imaginative set pieces with grounded action and some cool practical stunts instead of the usual CGI and green screen overload! Oh, and this is that very rare MCU movie to actually feature scenes of the heroes saving individual civilians in a more \"first responder\" context rather than just \"saving the world\" - a little of that stuff goes a long way for me.The film isn't perfect. It's structurally choppy, and the second act is almost nonexistent. At times, it feels like we're sprinting from one great moment to another without room to let them breathe. The Valentina subplot is undercooked, and the runtime could've used an extra twenty minutes. But you know what? The flaws almost feel fitting. This is a film about broken people. It wears its own scars proudly.This may be a team-up film, but it very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back, while Lewis Pullman delivers a standout performance as a sympathetic character at war with himself. Pugh is an absolute powerhouse who makes it clear that her Yelena is a foundational MCU centrepiece. Her father/daughter chemistry with David Harbour's Alexei is just as resonant as it was in Black Widow; the two of them really know how to walk the line between camp and comedy without becoming caricatures, grounding the whole thing in genuinely believable emotion.The film really made me turn around on Wyatt Russell's John Walker as well, though I did wish we got a little more from Hannah John-Kamen and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who occasionally fade into the background. And I'm sure it's no surprise that Sebastian Stan was fantastic as Bucky once again - but we've known he's great in this role for years. (He does get an awesome action-star moment here though!) The whole cast is incredibly charismatic and elevates the film with their performances and chemistry.Thunderbolts may not be the flashiest, funniest, or most polished Marvel film, but its rough edges and imperfections somehow all feel fitting for this anti-hero team of misfits. I personally loved it - it touched me in a way I was unprepared for and left me feeling genuinely fulfilled. It's a real breath of fresh air: a fleshed-out story with poignant themes, wonderful characters, and the kind of ensemble piece the MCU has needed dearly.Though it stumbles slightly in its rhythm, keeping the film from reaching its full potential, it shines as a compelling group therapy session, diving into the psyche of its rogues. These might not be the heroes we deserve, but they're the ones Marvel needs right now. Jake Schreier lovingly shepherds in a whole new band of misfits in a film about rediscovering passion and purpose in the unlikeliest of places - about embracing the entirety of yourself, even the darkness, in order to be whole. It plays like a brilliantly cathartic self-reflection from a studio that's well aware it's lost a step.Thunderbolts is a monumental win for the MCU!Also - the score by Son Lux was awesome (no surprise after their work on Everything Everywhere All At Once)."

          "content": "One of the better films in the MCU post-Endgame, which unfortunately isn't saying a lot. While Thunderbolts rises above the likes of Thor Love & Thunder and The Marvels, it doesn't reach the heights of films like Spiderman No Way Home or even Guardians of the Galaxy 3.Thunderbolts is a mostly enjoyable film with some noticeable miscues that likely get more noticeable the more you investigate them and reflect on the MCU history of some of our \"heroes\".The plot of Thunderbolts is simple on its face, a basic revenge story, but becomes a lot more messy when you dig in further. Our characters (Yelena, John Walker, Ghost and Taskmaster) have all made their recent living doing mercenary jobs for Valentina, the current head of the CIA, who was formally involved with O. X. E Group, a shady big corporation involved in questionable experiments. Valentina attempts to trick Yelena, Walker, Ghost and Taskmaster, into killing each other to tie up lose ends as she is being investigated for impeachment by congress. When our \"heroes\" discover they've been setup, they work together to take down Valentina and expose her corruption. Bucky Barnes, now a new congressman, joins our story as he is conducting his own investigation into Valentina. Alexei/Red Guardian becomes entangled with our group, mostly through Yelena and a very lucky chance encounter with Valentina. Lastly, newcomer Bob plays a key role as a new friend to Yelena with his own tragic past that drives the back half of the film.The first act runs a bit long and probably spends too much time on the wrong subjects. I think we spend too much time in the congressional hearing with Valentina, too much time getting to the bunker and too much time getting out of the bunker, specifically in the elevator scene. I think that time could have been better spent, fleshing out more about Valentina's past with OXE and their Sentry experiments as well as spend more time getting to know Bob and his relationship with Yelena. Though Lewis Pullman/Bob and Florence Pugh/Yelena, give good performances throughout, they don't get a lot of time to establish their relationship that's meant to be a focal point throughout the story. Similarly, we don't get a lot of time to catchup with our other characters, Bucky, Ghost, Walker and Taskmaster.After we exit the bunker, we again spend too much time in the desert and Alexei's limo rescue relies on a lot of good faith. We understand in his early conversation with Yelena that he'd love to return to \"hero\" work with Valentina but its a bit of a stretch that not only is he able to get his limo service into this gala that Valentina attends but Valentina also happens to get into his limo as she discusses the bunkers location and her plans to eliminate the remaining heroes. If this was the direction the film wanted to go, they could have given us more of Alexei planning to meet and interact with Valentina rather than relying on mere chance.All this time would probably be better spent on the final act. Bob's transition into the Sentry is pretty rushed as well as his turn to the Void, Though Lewis Pullman is able to pull off all aspects of Bob, from the amnesiac timid Bob, to the godlike Sentry, to the villainous Void, the film would have been strengthen with more time to understand each personality and the transition between them.Similarly, we could have spent more time in the Void world and understand how it impacted our characters. We spend a lot of time with Yelena and Bob in the Void world but what about everyone else? How did Bucky handle being faced with his worst memories after all the rehabilitation he's gone through? What did Alexei or Ghost even see and how did they get past it?Lastly, Valentina's story throughout is a bit messy and could have used more time to explain her grand plan and O. X. E's history with the Sentry project. Valentina is played as a master manipulator and planner but it doesn't always come across as such. Bob was overlooked as a survivor of the Sentry project and somehow ended up in the bunker without her knowledge. Valentina's plan to just blow up her O. X. E facilities may destroy evidence but would likely raise further eyebrows with the Congressional committee investigating her activities. This plot thread is features heavily in the first act, is sprinkled throughout the 2nd act but basically vanishes in the finale.Bucky - One of the most featured MCU characters going all the way back to Phase 1, Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes has never had the chance to fully break out. Regulated to a freezer until the Snap and then passed over as Captain America, Thunderbolts finally gave him the chance to take a step into the spotlight. Unfortunately, Bucky is again relegated to a side character in Thunderbolts with Yelena operating as our central character. The biggest question for Bucky is how and why did he become a congressman? While this was teased in Captain America Brave New World, it is done so with no background. How did a former soviet super soldier responsible for killing JFK and Howard Stark gain the trust of voters and the US government to serve as a representative? And why did he even want to do this? By the films end, he seemingly has returned to his Winter Soldier moniker as a member of The New Avengers and put his brief congressional days in the past.Yelena - Florence Pugh gives a good performance throughout the film and is one of its highlights. The main problem for her is her depression comes a bit out of nowhere given her prior MCU appearances. In Black Widow and Hawkeye, despite her past, she is a plucky and humorous and doesn't display the emptiness and depression that is present in this film. It also is curious why, after finding out Val lied about Clint Barton killing her sister, she decides to continue working for Val.John Walker - Walker, along with other characters, doesn't get a lot of time in this film. Walker is characterized as the jerk and the frequent punching bag for the rest of the cast, despite his decorated career in the military. Walker's personality in this film does not match his character in the Falcon & Winter Soldier miniseries. This film mistakes his seriousness and mission focus in that show and translates it to a jerk that doesn't play well with others.Ghost - Ghost also does not get a lot of time in this film and frankly probably should have been cut entirely. When we last see Ghost in Antman & the Wasp, she appears to be on a redemption arc that would possibly lead to a life of heroism. Instead, she has turned to a life of crime and it's not clear why other than she had a hard life. Cutting her character entirely would provide more time with other characters and focus the story on characters that have much more in common.Bucky, Alexei and John are all super soldiers, who fell from grace in one form or another. Alexei and Bucky share a soviet history, Bucky and John share their history from the miniseries, and Alexei and John both would like to reclaim their former glory. Yelena fits in as well as a Red Room spy with immediate ties to Alexei but also would have more time to develop her relationship with Bob.Taskmaster - Cut her entirely from the film. She doesn't need to be in the film. A waste of a character to introduce her in Black Widow, setup the potential for a redemption and kill her off with essentially no dialogue. After a life of brainwashing courtesy of her father, it's odd to see Taskmaster find a new person in Valentina to take orders from but its something that could have been explored. Instead, she goes out with a bang.Alexei/Red Guardian - Alexei is fine in the film and isn't impacted too much. He's played for a fool a bit too much compared to the cunning spy he's shown to be early on in Black Widow. He shares key emotional beats with Yelena that may be a bit undermined by his humor.Bob/Sentry/The Void - Lewis Pullman gives a great performance in all three roles. As mentioned previously, the film could have given more time to flesh out Bob's backstory as well as his transition to Sentry and the Void. We understand his struggles stem mostly from his abusive father, but more time could have been spent possibly in the Void world showing his time in the Sentry experiments to understand how he got his powers.Tackling mental illness and depression is a tall task for any film, especially a superhero film so I applaud Marvel for giving it an attempt. The attempt is a good one with some good elements throughout but it does feel a bit surface level. Being in the MCU and having to appeal to a younger audience may have restricted the film from truly addressing its darker subject matter. The film's quick \"power of friendship\" resolution may suffice in a kids movie but a more in-depth exploration of depression and finding a way forward would have been more appropriate here.Thunderbolts is a step up from some of the really bad MCU project's post endgame but still struggles. Cutting unneeded characters (Ghost & Taskmaster) and trimming the bunker and desert sequences would give more time to develop characters like Bob, explore plot elements like the Sentry project or Val's O. X. E Group, and strengthen character relationships between Bob and Yelena and the other members of the Thund... New Avengers."

          "content": "A curiosity from the Marvel cabinet. My jumbled mind doesn't have the storage space for small screen Marvel shows so I know there's a lot of detail in this movie that went over my head. It wasn't ever this way in the past but these days it's par for the course. I didn't let that stop me from enjoying the movie's intent. It's a solid B(+) movie without the polish of the headline Marvel outings. But there's a freedom in flying below the radar. The minimalist, almost Indie-type approach to the story & FX is shrewdly used to good effect. Some elements reminded me of some Spike Jonze music videos of the 90's. Not a bad thing at all.Cinematographically, it opens with a hark back to classic, big screen cinematography. Deep blacks, colour finesse, meticulous use of spacial depth. Alas, it falls away to the flattish MCU tone which we've become accustomed to over the last decade. Particularly during action sequences does the photography take second place. That's to be expected. The ensemble chemistry is there. JL Dreyfus does more than any normal person could with those bizzare lines she's often sprouting. Harbour, Pugh, et al have their respective character tones absolutely spot-on.There's an small-screen episodic vibe that creeps in to movies these days that irks me. I was watching this movie, hoping that Tom Cruise's upcoming MI:8 revels in its big-screenicity, even in spite of a sensible story - I don't care!But Thunderbolts* gave a mega-franchise a welcome introspective bent."

However, even though the movie makes a bold attempt, the overall atmosphere and character dynamics unfortunately fail to reflect the unique excitement and synergy created by the \"Avengers\" franchise.First of all, the cast of characters in Thunderbolts* is diverse, in keeping with the anti-hero theme. However, when it comes to the in-depth treatment of these characters, the movie occasionally falls short. The dynamic between them feels more like a task-oriented unity than an organic bond. Instead of witnessing the inner conflicts of the characters, the viewer often has to be content with accompanying the course of events.In terms of direction and visual design, the film is professionally crafted. The dark tones and action scenes are technically satisfying. However, the overall rhythm of the story occasionally falters and there is a distinct lack of pacing, especially in the second act.While Thunderbolts* is sincere in its intention to offer a new perspective on the universe, it fails to make an emotional connection and draw the audience in."

Some of the setup didn't quite make sense but it was fun enough to play along. The biggest disappointment was the third act. First of all, the reason you want to see a movie with a group of superheros is so you can watch them all work together on screen. If they have good chemistry it can be very entertaining (avengers 1).The problem here is that the third act almost COMPLETELY sidelines the characters into an anticlimactic situation that consists of almost no action. Instead, you're stuck watching the villain battle his inner demons and cut scene to several slow motion shots and over the top CGI that lasts far too long. I almost walked out of the theater I got so bored.When it comes to villains, they escalated this villain's powers way too much. I mean he reached Superman level. How can you take the team of Thunderbolts (some human and some enhanced human) and put them against such a high powered villain? I knew instantly all the fun had been taken out of the film because there was no way to have the characters defeat the villain. We like seeing hero's rise to a challenge and defeat villains who are slightly stronger. But this was ridiculous, it just wasn't an occasion they could rise to and I knew that some stupid trope was gonna have to be used to tie this mess together. And sure enough, the Thunderbolts had to use love and kindness to persuade the villain to be nice again. I agree with another review on here that said the movie is just an extended trailer. Oh and somehow even Yelena can dodge bullets even though she's human, and every gunman is too slow to stop her, every single man she fights somehow has his back turned, etc. Etc. They don't even try to place her strategically in an environment to show how she could win a gun fight with no guns and no super powers. Anyway it's a decent movie for home viewing but wouldn't recommend theater watch. I had a free ticket."

          "content": "Despite game work by all of the actors, the script and direction ultimately stumble in this good but nowhere near great MCU content.Black Widow II (Florence Pugh) is depressed/mourning the loss of her sister. In a scene that should be slowed down or broken in two, she visits her dad, Red Guardian (a dynamic David Harbour), who notes that helping people in order to get them to worship you makes life worthwhile. Okay. She gets a new assignment from her boss Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to secure a vault, a scene that takes up far too much screen time (marketing copy reveals the whole movie was originally conceived of as being in the vault).There she meets other fourth-tier MCU villains, who, in the style of the United States, we must now view of heroes. Of the bunch, Wyatt Russell as U. S. Agent succeeds best is giving us someone we feel we shouldn't like. As Ghost, Hannah John-Kamen is given far too little to do and too much of her background is sketched into dialogue asides. Olga Kurylenko as Taskmaster has one line again (after having one line in BLACK WIDOW) and is dispatched brutally and (actually) surprisingly, the only time the stakes are really raised in this movie. All these characters deserve another beat or two more to flesh them out.In the vault, we also meet Bob/Sentry (not the guy from THE BEAR although you will look twice), a schlub. Somehow, experimentation from OxGroup (Os Group? Osc Group?) has miraculously turned him into MCU's Superman. Because of his movie version of dissociative identity disorder, he is also half-villain (like the rest of the Thunderbolts, get it?).A reluctant team forms (and the crowds shrugs, \"Sure\"). After that, things happen quickly. Too quickly.Since the team cannot physically overpower the coolly designed, dark half of Sentry, the climax battle takes place in a series of dull (but cheap to decorate) BEING JOHN MALKOVICH mind rooms. A big hug resolves it all. Oh come on!It doesn't help that Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays her villainess role VEEPishly, so tongue in cheek that she never seems a danger to anyone more than in a public relations way. Geraldine Viswanathan comes off as a bland Millennial Mel whose betrayal or non-betrayal of Elaine is never developed or clarified.Worst of all, by the second stinger, the film just seems to exist in order to lean toward a giant movie asked for by the C Suite guys who only care about the money."

It didn't make me laugh, didn't surprise me, and didn't truly entertain me.We're living in a time when some truly incredible films are being released- original, daring, emotionally resonant stories, and watching something that felt so outdated just wasn't enjoyable. It felt more like a children's movie, recycling the same concept I've seen countless times before.Don't get me wrong, the movie wasn't bad. It was fine. But what really happened here is that, after so many people demanded Marvel return to their \"classic formula,\" they took that feedback too literally. Instead of evolving and pushing their stories forward, they went backwards. The result is a movie that leans too heavily on nostalgia, without offering anything fresh or meaningful.Marvel needs to stop relying on flashy effects and shallow humor, and start investing in deeper, more complex storytelling. The typical \"team comes together to save the world, a villain appears, odds seem impossible, but somehow everything works out in the end\" formula is tired. It's time for something more... something that reflects the maturity of the audience that grew up with these films.Or maybe I just need to move on and let the next generation enjoy these movies :{"

The visuals I was stunned when I saw how great the cgi and vfx I was crisp and well taken care of (maybe even compare it to a Christopher Nolan film)\nYou can really see the effort they put into this and I'm so happy that they let the vfx team work their magic5. The plot (don't worry no spoiler)\nIt's not your \"A typical\" stereotypical mcu film\nIt actually has personality and I'm digging it\nI like that they tried something a bit different\nIt talks through stuff that are relatable and important and without being boring or too longBut now the cons\nI would count these as spoilers cause they will affect how you view the film subconsciously\nBut it still doesn't have anything that would spoil the plotThese are my personal subjective problems with this film, so feel free to not share my opinion.1.

It's not just another superhero film with flashy battles; it feels like a grounded, character-driven narrative that explores how broken people find purpose.With a cast including Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, and John Walker, there's great potential for internal conflict, uneasy alliances, and powerful dialogue. The tone seems darker, with a \"found family\" element that reminds me of *The Suicide Squad* but with a Marvel sensibility.If executed well, this film could become a turning point for Phase 5 of the MCU-offering both action and introspection. I'm especially looking forward to how it explores consequences, trauma, and second chances-something rare in superhero storytelling."

Its bold focus on mental health is the beating heart of the film, shaping the story in a way that's refreshingly original. We've had plenty of superhero (and anti-hero) movies, but none have tackled mental health as deeply or as honestly as this. This is as fresh as it gets, and the film hits its message squarely on the mark. Could that message have been louder or more powerful? Absolutely. But is it enough for audiences to understand, feel, and reflect on? Without a doubt. It's a gem that invites viewers to empathize, to look inward, and to recognize the struggles of those around them. In many ways, Thunderbolts feels like a superhero in its own right, delivering a powerful PSA that's woven seamlessly into the narrative rather than feeling tacked on.We're in love with the concept here; an anti-hero film built around mental health. It makes the story and the character arcs far deeper and more meaningful than they'd be if these were just your typical caped crusaders. Thunderbolts* is the MCU's rawest exploration of mental health to date. We've heard the words \"trauma\" and \"healing\" tossed around in superhero flicks before like WandaVision, but this is different. This film doesn't just mention the weight of mental health, it lives in it. Yelena's story, in particular, has been carefully nurtured since Phase 4, and the decision to continue her journey down this road is nothing short of brilliant. Yelena, like Black Widow before her, isn't a superhero with powers. She's human. She's flawed, resilient, and painfully relatable and that makes her journey hit even harder.We actually like the character dynamics between the anti-heroes. We like that every of their personality shines. Their dynamics push the film's mental health themes even further. These might have been the underdogs of previous movies, characters we barely remembered but here, they get their moment. And wow, do they deliver. Each one gets time to prove they're so much more than sidekicks or forgotten faces and by the end, you can't help but root for them.What's especially moving is how much these characters matter both to themselves and to each other. They've all been torn down, denigrated, beaten back, and made to feel like the world is against them. They're loners by nature, forced into the uncomfortable space of working as a team for the first time. Watching them navigate that, to lean on each other when things fall apart, is both heartwarming and powerful. It's a clear reminder of the importance of friendship, of admitting when you need help, and of realizing that none of us can do it all alone.The action sequences in this are great. It's a blast watching everyone throw down and show off their skills. But here's the thing, while the action is awesome, it's not what makes this film great. This movie proves that a superhero film doesn't need to lean on endless explosions to leave an impact. The story itself is raw, human, and beautifully told and that is more than enough. That's why Thunderbolts* stands tall in the post-Endgame era. The action is tight, but the storytelling is what really puts it over the top.And guess what? They didn't rely on cameos. We could safely say that Deadpool vs Wolverine, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Thunderbolts* are the top 3 films after Avengers Endgame but what Thunderbolts* sets apart from the other two is it's the only one that doesn't rely on cameos. It doesn't need nostalgic bait, it doesn't need 'help' from anyone, it's just them trying to save the day and trying to figure out how to solve the problems they are in. And we love them for it.Florence Pugh, as always, is a knockout. She's never missed a beat, and once again, she's phenomenal here. Her accent might not be perfect, but who cares? She's a powerhouse, carrying the weight of a character struggling with identity and searching for meaning. She's the voice of so many who feel lost or stuck, and Pugh brings that to life with so much heart. She's a beacon of hope, a reminder that even when it feels impossible, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The rest of the cast? Stellar too. Lewis Pullman deserves a special shoutout. He proves here that he's a force to be reckoned with. Forget the early skepticism about his casting. He owns it completely, and Hollywood seriously needs to give this guy more credit.And yes, Malaysia plays a huge role in this film and the Menara Merdeka 118 shot is breathtaking. Instead of the usual sunny, warm tones we often see, the film opts for a moodier palette blue, dark, and cloudy which beautifully matches the film's somber, reflective theme. It just fits.The third act really dives deep into the mental health themes, in a way that feels raw and personal. The true villain here isn't a monster or alien, it's the demons we all battle inside. It emphasizes this theme in a way that feels plausible, personable and relatable. A villain that lives within all of us. A villain that everyone of us has battled against in some way and some parts in our lives. How much you connect with the film might depend on how you view your life and how much experience you've dealt with but one thing's for sure, it'll leave you thinking long after the credits roll.Was anything wasted in this film? There is one. One character didn't get nearly the spotlight they deserved. Everyone else got their moment to shine except for one and that felt like a missed opportunity.As for the comedy, it's hit and miss. Some of it lands really well. The belly-laugh kind of good while other moments fall flat or feel a bit forced. Some jokes could've used a little more setup, and a few felt repetitive, but overall, there's enough good humor sprinkled in.We did feel like the third act could have fleshed out more. It could have used more breathing room. It moves fast, too fast at times and some moments feel rushed or a bit disjointed. If they'd let things simmer just a bit longer, it could have been even more impactful.And yes, Thunderbolts* has 2 credits scene. The first one is simply light and funny which is bearable enough but the second one will hype everyone up for what's to come. Not that it's important to reveal it at the end credits but with audience losing hope for the future of MCU, this will get everyone back on their feet, cheering and hoping that Phase 6 will be the same with what Phase 3 had to offer...or at least almost.Verdict: Thunderbolts* is the anti-hero film we didn't know we needed. It delivers a story rooted in something we all face: mental health. This is raw. It's personal. And it feels relatable and real. It explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the power of asking for help, making it one of the MCU's most personal stories yet. It ditches the nostalgia bait and focuses on characters wrestling with their own demons, making their journeys relatable and impactful. The action is tight, but it's the emotional weight that truly lands (Yes, we did cry a bit). Florence Pugh leads with power and vulnerability, backed by a stellar cast and the famous Malaysia's Menara Merdeka 118 isn't just cinematic, it symbolizes the towering weight these characters carry. Thank you, Marve."

          "content": "Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) launched Phase 1 with Iron Man in 2008, it has captivated global audiences with its vast worldview, compelling stories, and diverse superheroes. However, with the original Avengers' conclusion in Avengers: Endgame, Marvel entered a transitional phase. As the final entry in Phase 5, Thunderbolts shoulders the mission of charting a new course for the MCU.I. Cast: A Fusion of Talent and Potential\nThunderbolts features a stellar cast of accomplished actors:\nFlorence Pugh shines as Yelena Belova (the second \"Black Widow\"), delivering a nuanced performance that captures the character's vitality, intelligence, grief, and inner struggle following Natasha's death.Sebastian Stan embodies Bucky Barnes (\"Winter Soldier\") with steadfast reliability, showcasing leadership amid complex missions and team conflicts.David Harbour balances strength and humor as Red Guardian (Alexei), creating a compelling contrast between arrogance and occasional naivety.Wyatt Russell explores the internal conflict of John Walker (\"U. S. Agent\"), dissecting the character's loyalty and hidden ambition.Lewis Pullman portrays Sentry (Robert Reynolds) with vulnerability and power, adding depth to the comic's one-dimensional figure.Supporting actors like Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost), Olga Kurylenko (Taskmaster), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Valentina) further enrich the film's ensemble.II. Promotions: Anticipation Through Controversy\nPre-release marketing sparked intrigue via a mysterious asterisk in the title, kept secret until the film's launch. Post-screening, Marvel renamed it The New Avengers, revealing the asterisk symbolized the team inheriting the Avengers' legacy as the MCU's new core. This rebranding divided fans-some praised its fresh direction, while others criticized \"nostalgia-baiting.\" Regardless, it successfully generated buzz and positioned the film as a pivotal narrative shift.III. Film Performance: Bright Spots and Shortcomings\n(1) Story Structure and Plot\nThe film employs a classic three-act structure:\nAct 1 introduces a group of marginalized heroes lured into a deadly mission, anchored by a high-energy opening action sequence and snappy character-driven dialogue.Act 2 twists as the team realizes they are disposable pawns, leading to fractured trust and eventual camaraderie during their escape.Act 3 concludes with an emotional climax, where the team uses empathy- but not brute force-to redeem the out-of-control Sentry, adding depth to the finale.Weaknesses: Mid-film pacing drags due to convoluted character psychology, and reliance on coincidences undermines narrative logic.(2) Character Development\nYelena's arc from grief-stricken assassin to team leader offers emotional resonance, while Sentry's duality (vulnerability vs. Godlike power) adds complexity.Supporting roles like Bucky and Red Guardian show growth through subtle details, but Bucky and Walker feel underdeveloped, serving more as plot devices than fully realized characters.(3) Action and Visual Effects\nHighlights: A long-take corridor fight with Yelena and multi-angled battles with Sentry showcase innovative choreography and dynamic camera work. Sentry's \"Void\" form and Yelena's psychological sequences blend realism with surreal visuals.Drawback: Climactic action feels repetitive, with underutilized character abilities and limited teamwork.(4) Themes and Depth\nThe film challenges traditional superhero tropes by exploring \"heroism as self-redemption\" and moral ambiguity through anti-heroes. Yelena's transformation and Sentry's internal conflict highlight themes of power, responsibility, and healing through connection. However, its critique of American heroism and political metaphors are overly blunt, risking cultural alienation for non-U. S. audiences.(5) Music and Sound Design\nThe score intensifies action with pulsing electronics and softens emotional beats with piano-driven melodies. Sound effects-from visceral combat to otherworldly powers-enhance immersion, though late-film.consistency falters.IV. Future Impact on the MCU: Opportunities and Challenges\n(1) Character and Team Legacy\nYelena is poised to lead the New Avengers, embodying Natasha's legacy.Sentry's duality could spark cosmic conflicts, mirroring figures like Doctor Strange.The Thunderbolts' flawed camaraderie offers narrative potential for future MCU arcs, balancing chaos or clashing with other factions.(2) Audience Expectations and Rebranding\nWhile Thunderbolts performs well in Western markets, its underperformance in Asia highlights Marvel's need for cultural diversity and emotional depth. Global audiences now demand less spectacle and more nuanced storytelling, pushing Marvel to evolve beyond formulaic tropes.Conclusion: Thunderbolts is a bold but imperfect experiment, offering a fresh anti-heroic lens for the MCU. Despite its flaws, it lays groundwork for new narratives, proving that risk-taking-even with missteps-could define the franchise's next era."

The story was good in how it brought the unlikely hero's together naturally rather than forcing it. I like how we got Bucky being portrayed old style wintersoldier with the bike/car scene. It did feel like it focused on Black widow more than anyone else but I didn't mind that. The fight sequences showed everyone's capability's well and overall it's a got the classic marvel funny gags. I did for minute wonder how they were gonna overcome the villain and that's where you know it's a good one. Rated 7/10 because we have had the bar naturally set high with phase 3 but we need to move on and FOCUS on the positives rather than the many negatives in the last few marvel projects. So 7/10 is a win."

But to my surprise, I actually found myself enjoying the movie and its characters.The story isn't as grand or universe-shattering as other Marvel films, but that worked in its favor. It struck a good balance of action, over-the-top moments, drama, and just the right amount of that signature Marvel humor (which I usually find annoying, but it landed better here).I don't have many complaints, though I think they'll need to raise the stakes a bit in the next installment if they want to elevate it to true Avengers-level hype. What I really appreciated was that it wasn't politically heavy-handed like a lot of recent Disney productions. Those overused millennial tropes are exactly what usually keep me out of theaters-this film managed to steer clear of that."

          "content": "It's no secret that the MCU hasn't had a good movie (excepting Guardians 3) since Endgame, and even Endgame was more of a resolution than a great movie unto itself. The new phase has varied from mediocre to bad to Quantumania (a movie so bad, that I believe it should be it's own adjective). The one exception (G3) is more a remnant of the old era than part of the new.This is why I think alot of people are overpraising Thunderbolts, which is a nice solid movie...but is hardly amazing. If this had come out during the MCU's glory days, it would have felt like a solidly average movie by MCU standards. It would stand alongside Thor 1 or Cap 1 or Black Panther as \"yup, that's another MCU movie\". But surround it with the recent Falcon movie, Dr. Strange 2, Eternals, and so on and Thunderbolts stands tall and proud by comparison.IMHO, the best things about this movie are the actors/characters. Especially Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Julie Louis-Dreyfus. I'd like to give Sebastian Stan a shoutout, but did Bucky really do anything but flex and look like the adult in a group of bickering children?But that is what used to make the MCU great. The MCU movies were never elite scripts/plots. They were basic fun action/comedy/spectacle movies with fun, bright characters played by actors with charisma and charm. And despite Ghost and US Agent being pretty bland, the movie mostly delivers. JLD does well as the scenery chewing villainess, Pugh and Harbour are priceless in this, as they were in Black Widow. It's still an absolute crime that Disney sat on it's thumbs and wasted it's shot at a good Black Widow movie, only producing one far too late.I also want to give the movie credit for doing a very cliche thing with the respect to Sentry, but doing it in a way that felt earned and believable, when it very easily could have been eye-rollingly stupid. If you've seen the movie, I suspect you can guess what I mean, but I don't want to spoil anything.There definitely are some moments where characters know things they shouldn't know, or where power levels seem inconsistent. I'm not going to claim it's a 'clean' movie in that respect. Some things occurred that were a bit too 'just so'. But there weren't any that took me out of the movie...except one. I really didn't like how omnipotent Sentry was from a 'super soldier program'. Every other super soldier program produced low tier super-people. Sentry was Superman+. This seems orders of magnitude beyond others, and makes it hard to swallow that there won't be a billion such programs going forward.I think the humor was okay, but not excellent. The action setpieces were fine...but seldom as impressive as some of the MCU's past offerings.I think the only person in this that really inspires 'hero' is Yelena...the others kind of all feel like joke characters. Even Bucky, despite being portrayed consistently seriously and competent doesn't really feel like a part of a headliner group...which is part of the point of course. But I feel like that lack of a standout hurts going forward. Heck, Yelena's best showcase really comes in a weak movie alot of people skipped (Black Widow) and a streaming series that even more people skipped (Hawkeye).So basically, good movie, I enjoyed it, but let's keep the praise reasonable."

Sentry is a clearly reskinned version of Wanda. Her arc throughout WandaVision was well done. This here, is just the CliffsNotes version. Essentially, Sentry goes through depression and unintentionally hurts people in the process by sucking them into a fake alternate reality. Valentina takes over for Director Hayward, who instead of trying to reboot Vision for the government to control, creates Sentry. Last but not least, Yelena subs in for Vision or Monica Rambeau as the main empathetic hero, her role is to try to reason with Sentry and understand and relate to all the pain that he has gone through.I really hope this unintentional, but it doesn't seem possible considering how similar it is. To me it looks like Marvel was desperate for a win before Doomsday. So, they repackaged something that worked and tried to sell it to a larger audience. Disgraceful.PS: Wanda deserved to be in The New Avengers after her arc in WandaVision, but you blew it. You had it all, and you blew it."

So if you haven't watched Black Widow, Falcon and the Winter soldier series and Antman 2 then you might be a bit confused about who some of these characters are so I would recommend you watch these before watching this. And this group of anti-heroes get put against each other in a good fight scene at the beginning and shortly afterwards are forced to work together to stop a new threat from destroying the Earth.I think my favorite character in this film is Yelena because we see plenty of her good fighting skills, especially in the first scene where she is sent on a mission to take out a secret laboratory and has to fight off quite a lot of guards at the same time. Like in Black Widow, Yelena makes plenty of sarcastic comments which are funny.I also enjoyed watching the Winter soldier in a cool car chase where he's riding a motorbike. This reminded of the chase scenes in Terminator 2 and 3 where Arnie is on a motorbike. But I think this scene could have been made better if marvel had have increased the age rating of this film and then they could have made it more violent. I also would have liked to have seen more car chase scenes like this.Another thing I would have liked to have seen is more action in the last 20-30 minutes because unlike in most marvel films it didn't feel like there was a final big fight scene and then the credits started rolling up and I was left feeling a bit disappointed.Although I did enjoy the action in the rest of the movie so I would give it a 7/10 and probably will buy it when it comes out on DVD, but I'll wait until the price comes down a little bit."

They all go through many emotions and come off as real, flawed, and complex characters, except for the villain, who is very funny but deeply and efficiently evil. The performance is a counterpoint to the characterization of Amanda Waller, where De Fontaine is actually quite likable and funny. The heroes all use humor to deal with everything going on internally, making it all the more powerful to watch them bond as a team. Pullman as Bob is phenomenal; perfect casting as he comes off as someone you feel sorry for and yet someone to be afraid of. This was a good role for him.Mental health, loneliness, and friendship are explored in a very layered, sadly funny, but eerily personal way that leaves a powerful impact on the audience. I laughed, cried, and felt fear watching this, and it opened me to some sober reflection on through people I interact with and how I interact with them."

But slowly they transition into a cliche, cringe, lackluster, boring emotion ride over the main villain. Having to comfort him in order to not destroy the world in the lamest way possible. They introduce plenty of \"shock factor\" moments to make you think they're bringing back the OG style of marvel. But all this shock factor and comedy is just to blind you from seeing how boring this film really is. It had the people around me sitting with their face on their palms bored out of their mind within the \"end fight\".I guarantee if you have a brain and really pay attention to this film you'll understand what I'm talking about. And you'll see behind the trashy writing team, production, and Disney's trash overreach within the film."

I love how the characters. There isn't a character that I hated in this film, once again I love the characters.Furthermore, I really liked how this film had emotional moments near the end. The ending showed how depression is like a darkness that consumes you and how there are people there for you(Sounds a lot better in the movie). And with emotional moments the film contained a ton of comedic moments that made me laugh a lot.I'm surprised how this movie doesn't have more than 8 stars, because it is actually soo good. This is probably my favorite marvel film to date, I don't recall a life changing and mind-blowing marvel movie like this that I watched. And this is amazing for all the trash movies that marvel previously made. Like: Kraven the hunter, madame web, captain America: brave new world, Antman and the wasp quantomania.9.75/10* for the thunderbolts."

          "content": "Thunderbolts\" it's some of Marvel's darkest material to date, dealing with the emotional wreckage of broken individuals grappling with their past choices and finding camaraderie amidst the emptiness of their lives. This may be a team-up movie, but it very much belongs to Florence Pugh, who carries much of the dramatic weight of the movie on her back, while Lewis Pullman delivers a complex performance as a sympathetic character at war with himself. The imperfections somehow all feel fitting for this anti-hero team of misfits. Putting emphasis on the character work and practical action makes this feel like the old Marvel that has us for a decade plus. Wish we'd gotten this sooner.\"Thunderbolts*\" it's a bold dive into trauma, healing, and redemption. Proof that even the so-called defective losers and disposable delinquents can rise above their past and become the heroes no one expected. It's gritty, emotional and unlike anything Marvel has done before - a must-see story that hits where it hurts and heals where it matters.I can tell that the movie is one of Marvel's most enjoyable films in a while. It feels different than most of the studio's projects. Its bold, funny, filled with great action and an unexpected emotional punch. It has the rewatchable factor for sure. Has so much spark, charisma, and tells a genuinely emotional story you connect with.It is truly fantastic, the cast has electric chemistry with each other (Florence Pugh & Lewis Pullman are the standouts) and the action sequences are very strong. But most of all, the movie's story is bold, important & so well-written. Florence Pugh brings the heart, David Harbour is consistently funny, & Lewis Pullman might be the stealth MVP.This is probably one of he most if not the most humane movie filled with allowing their anti hero being flawed, broken and regretful. Sebastian Stan has an absolute scene stealing moment, yet Florence Pugh shows she is the true lead of the new generation and team. She is the star, that shines the brightest. There's a lot to love in this movie honestly."

Solid film with some great performances.It's very character-driven, and touches on themes that are more serious and relatable than the usual Marvel fare. Even though this is \"The B-Team\", I ended up enjoying these characters a lot and would like to see them in the future Marvel projects. (Honestly I'm more excited to see where this group + Bob goes than RDJ as Dr. Doom.)They finally managed to do something different with Act 3 too, it is not \"giant laser from the sky CGI punchout fest\", and I was rather touched at how they solved the problem with the \"big bad\". I think if you like superheroes, want something that is a little more adult, and was missing the character focus from the MCU, then this is the movie to go to."

You've got Yelena Belova, Black Widow's sister, dropping one-liners like she's at a Russian dive bar. There's Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier, with all the charisma of a guy who just got dumped by his therapist. And then there's Red Guardian-a mix between a Soviet bear and a drunk uncle who downs a liter of vodka before rambling about his war stories.And let's not forget John Walker, the fake Captain America with the eyes of a coked-up chihuahua; Ghost, who thinks she's Casper but pissed off; and Taskmaster, a ninja who looks like they got lost on the way to Fortnite.The movie? It's their group therapy session. They're here to hate each other, punch each other, and eventually admit they're a family. It's a sitcom-if sitcoms were full of war trauma.Let's talk about Sentry. Marvel's Superman, but with the charisma of a depressed angel. A guy with the power of a million exploding suns, who spends most of his time wondering if his friends really like him. Imagine if Hulk had a literature degree and a death wish.And for once, they didn't screw up the character. He's there, radiating power without being a pompous blowhard. He's dangerous, but human. And for once, you actually want to follow him.The story? It's not groundbreaking. A bunch of losers who have to come together to keep the world from becoming a cosmic barbecue. Nothing new under the sun-but sometimes, the old recipes work.No need for fifteen subplots, no need for last-minute twists. It's basic but effective. They beat the crap out of each other, trade insults, save the helpless... and most importantly, they stop taking themselves too seriously.It's not Avengers, it's not Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's somewhere in between. A team of misfits learning to trust each other... or to punch each other in the face.No digital headache here. Marvel finally figured out that action scenes aren't just a pixel storm and endless explosions. The fights are clear, impactful, and best of all, you don't feel like you're watching a Red Bull-sponsored screensaver.Special mention to Red Guardian, who throws punches like a rampaging Soviet tractor. Every hit lands like a truck. It's raw, it's messy, it's visceral. The fights aren't ballet-they're bar brawls filmed with style.Florence Pugh drops one-liners like a sniper scores headshots. Yelena is the toxic little sister who majored in sarcasm. David Harbour is in full grumpy bear mode, cracking dad jokes with the charm of a drunken uncle.Sometimes the jokes land, sometimes they don't, but at least they try. This isn't Marvel going \"Hi, we're here to sell action figures.\" It dares to be a bit more trashy, a bit more direct, without diving headfirst into the usual moralizing.Not perfect, not revolutionary, but damn effective. Thunderbolts doesn't take you for an idiot. It throws a team of maniacs at you, who have to figure out how to work together without hugging every five minutes.It's violent, it's funny, it's sometimes emotional, and it never forgets to be fun. Marvel finally gets that not everything has to look like an ad for tolerance. Here, it's chaos, punches, and neuroses shot in cinematic style.So if you're sick of perfect superheroes giving speeches about love and hope, come watch Thunderbolts. This is hell... but with punchlines."

I would have loved if marvel actually had taken the step and decided to make it really dark and serious.Killing taskmaster that fast, made feel the Black widows movie end less important then it already was. I really hate what they did overall with the character.The endfight was very disappointing. I expected it to be a fight with himself.

          "content": "Thunderbolts* takes a bunch of relatively minor MCU characters and scoops them up into a \"Suicide Squad\" type adventure where they face off against insurmountable odds. Given most of the characters have appeared in TV shows, there is a distinct whiff of Disney+ about proceedings but it is also one of the most solid films Marvel has put out in years. The execs must have known they had something decent on their hands as they waited until a whole weekend after release to spoil the end twist with marketing, as appose to doing it in the trailers.The titular Thunderbolts are : New Black Widow, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), failed Captain America replacement John Walker (Wyatt Russell), former Winter Soldier turned congressman Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Russian super soldier and Yelena's adoptive father Red Guardian (David Harbour), Ant Man 2 alumni Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) and maybe mysterious newcomer Bob (Lewis Pullman). If you follow MCU events you will recognise most of them from past projects (mainly 2021's Black Widow) but no need to worry if you don't, there is some clunky exposition dialogue to catch you up on everyone's story. Events take place over a night and day as Yelena, Walker and Ghost (along with Taskmaster, another Black Widow legacy) are individually sent by sketchy CIA director Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to clean up an off the books warehouse that is tied to a congressional hearing. After a brief tussle they realise they themselves are considered loose ends to be disposed of and end up on a collision course with Valentina's super hero experiment \"Sentry\".So the characters aren't exactly household names but the film turns that to its advantage. Without a ton of baggage, Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo's script is able to mould the characters to fit the story. Harbour is funny as the over enthusiastic father figure, Russell is both smug and fragile and Stan is the cool uncle everybody wants to be. Ghost is probably least well served as the outsider looking for somewhere to belong while Yelana is the closest thing to a main character. If you are going to pick someone to hang your movie on, Florence Pugh is a solid shout and it's good to see her take centre stage after her underwhelming appearance in the Hawkeye TV show.The round pegs in round wholes philosophy extends to the production, with Jake Schreier turning out to be a smart choice for directing duty. He may only have two films under his belt but he has done plenty of TV and the ability to come on board an existing property and get the job done pays dividends. With a background in music videos he clearly has an eye for style and the film looks great, marrying a grounded, fairly real looking aesthetic with a nice colour palette. We also get a cool looking superhero fight and the final big bad is visualised in a unique and thematically sinister way.The story isn't anything spectacular and Red Guardian could drive an armoured limo through the plot holes, but having everything play out consecutively over a short space of time gives it a nice pace and sense of urgency. For a lot of the runtime it plays out like a child friendly(ish) version of Amazon show \"The Boys\", before ending on a finale that is basically a visual representation of battling depression. The MCU is often full of snarky and grandstanding main characters so it's a refreshing change to see the day being won by being nice. That said, depending on how you look at it, there are some uncharitable take aways regarding people with mental health issues not being fit for positions of responsibility or power. I'm sure any such message is unintentional and in a movie where a serum can dish out godlike powers, everything should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if you want to touch on such serious subject matter you really need to consider all angles.Marvel say this is there first film release under the new \"quality over quantity\" policy and it shows. It's ironic that the title is Thunderbolts* as it's the first MCU film in while that can be called good without needing to add an asterisk.7 sponsored Wheaties boxes out of 10."

          "content": "Thunderbolts*, a breath of fresh air from the Marvel Universe. To preface this. I'm not really a marvel fan, I've seen the main run of the Avengers films and they were fun, but they never tried to be more than fun, and I went to this on the hunch that it's ''different''. And to my joy, in many ways it is.It is still, a superhero action movie, don't think anything else. But it is much more character focused and especially has a stronger emotional hook to purpose and meaning and loneliness. Thanks to some great casting (also one of the reasons I pulled the trigger on going) the emotional moments work and come with a sincerity that was very much essential. And gladly the movie does take the time needed by just enough margin. It still has a few jokes to break tension here and there, but the dialog is mostly serious. Obviously due to the great set of characters we got.And about that. That is where the movie maybe overstepped or tried too much. As there is specifically one character that really felt left behind in their story. And that's the one that can turn invisible. She never really got enough depth and towards the end felt like the piece that was still missing. Which was a bummer.But.. this honestly... is Pugh's movie. It's her superhero movie and I'm all for it. She is the main focus and character and gets the spotlight. And as a fan. I could not be more happy. She's got the range to really nail this type of character. She excels at these pessimistic, cynical, emotionally torn characters and can bring them back to life too. She's the highlight of the movie no doubt. The accent.. fine I guess. It did not distract me. We're watching a fictional movie, that the accent might not be the most accurate (not that I could know even) is really a nuisance. That goes for Harbour too. It doesn't matter.Villain. One part great, the other part eh. I think the political storyline here is a bit cliche and whilst thankfully they go through those scenes quick enough I don't think Dreyfus was the right cast, not the best performance, she felt bland and never really did anything to remember. Tacked on just to get the story further, but she did get a lot of screentime.Storyflow and logic, there's a few ''where did he come from, or how?'' moments but thankfully not too much. You do need to keep your logic sensor to a minimum and enjoy the story driven ride. As otherwise you might get annoyed.About it's main messaging. I get the struggle of the filmmakers. This is still a big budget entertainment movie. You can't go arthouse and dive into some deep emotional turmoil. That just doesn't fit here. But they got a great balance. Sure I wanted a bit more. But I also need to remember this movie wasn't made for me, and needs to be more generalized and easy to approach and understand. But what it did, was good, and admirable. The writing for the ''villain'' in the dark aspect was a bit blunt, I wish it was sharper. But for that we needed sharper backstory for the villain to begin with. It's fine.Action, to be expected it's good. There's enough spectacle here but kept more subtle. It's not a loud movie, with fits the theme.Music is great. Especially excels towards the last half of the movie, though doesn't do enough to craft a real theme.A stronger focus on characters and their emotional turmoil and the toll of their type of work. It's an angle we needed for a while. And I'm glad it was made."

The story is complex and worth our attention as it covers unique perspectives on anti-heroes, mental health, and the power of teamwork. The film has a \"Chris Nolan\" complexity in how it jumps from reality to other dimensions (like your brain) to fight battles. The \"who is good and who is bad\" storyline is not new--but Thunderbolts* gives a new perspective on how to think about character complexity. The lead characters all do a great job, and the film never jumps too far into absurdity. Florence Pugh leads a strong cast that actually have to act here, which is suitable for co-leads like Sebastian Stan. Overall--8/10 and worth a trip to your local theater! If you watch at home, I hope you have a 100\" 4K TV and surround sound. These characters are likely to return for a sequel film. The film name is pretty clever when they explain it. /// My only complaint, which is relatively minor, concerns the political angle. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (yes, she co-starred in Seinfeld) plays a strangely evil political character who combines DC politics with bio-genetic and military research private industry conflicts. Fortunately, they avoided making this a political statement movie--but they got close. This storyline almost got off the rails. Most of that politics stuff is on the cutting room floor. The film is already over 2 hours, so we did not need a political film. But, I found it to be a strange role for her. I am glad it did not \"jump the shark\" with trying to connect all the evil it to any real person. Strong implications are that there will be a part 2."

          "content": "I have been a marvel fan my entire life, I read the comics, I go to conventions, I watch the movies and the shows. This move was about the very last thing I expected and the worst thing possible for me to watch. I have battled with depression hard for the last 4 years and walking into a movie with absolute zero warning (other than the knowledge of what and who the void is) that this was going to be one big explanation of every dark, horrid, sad, and all consuming thought I've ever had about myself was utterly heart wrenching. They portrayed depression mostly accurately but the solution? People telling you that you're not alone and proving it by a group hug? Was horrific. Anyone who has ever been depressed knows that's not enough in any way. Yes, it's nice to know that people are there for you but the reality of depression is that you think people being there for you is fake majority of the time. This movie said let me put the most basic, useless solution to depression and win against the bad guy only for the bad guy to have a blackout and not remember a single bit of it. How is that helpful? To anyone? Where is the growth? Where is the acknowledgement that it'll always be a struggle and not a big group hug is the answer to all depression episodes. Ultimately ignoring all the mental health problems, I think it was a fine movie. But I don't understand the hype and why everyone is saying this is top tier cinema. It's not, it's an okay action flick and a depression spiral waiting to happen. If you are saying it's amazing, you might have incorrect views on mental health and should really talk to the people in your lives who do struggle everyday because this movie was the last thing we needed."

          "content": "After a series of misses from Marvel, I can say we are back swinging. Thunderbolt is the best superhero movie we've gotten in a while. I figured it would be at least better than Brave New World, given my own theory. The theory was one of Brave New World or Thunderbolts was gonna be as bad as a movie like Quantamania then the other movie would be as good as The Winter Soldier. Since Brave New World was so bad, I figured Thunderbolts will be good. But I didn't expect it to be this good.First off, the acting here is top notch. David Harbour is consistently funny and Florence Pugh was fantastic as always. But Lewis Pullman was the main standout, he was phenomenal as Bob/Sentry/The Void. His character arc is amazing, he goes from being absolutely clueless to being an Avengers level threat in a spam of 30 minutes. Also Pullman's emotions feel too real.One of the biggest complaints I've had with Marvel lately is the amount of comedy. Its too much in some movies. Here, yes the comedy is there but it does get super dark. Biggest improvement there.Any complaints for Thunderbolts? None, except the fact that Taskmaster was killed off instantly. I kinda wish we had more screentime with Taskmaster, cause I didn't really like her role in Black Widow. But other than that, there is really nothing.We just need to see how good Fantastic 4 will be. I feel like it won't be as good as Thunderbolts, but it will be the best Fantastic 4 movie of all time. Since filming only began a week AFTER Deadpool and Wolverine was released in theaters."

          "content": "Marvel Studios has done it again. Thunderbolts is an absolute triumph, a pulse-pounding rollercoaster of action, emotion, and unexpected twists that solidifies its place as one of the most riveting entries in the MCU. From start to finish, the film delivers an exhilarating blend of high-stakes combat, gripping character arcs, and stunning visuals that leave audiences completely enthralled.An Unconventional Team-Up That Just Works\nUnlike traditional superhero ensembles, Thunderbolts thrives on the unique chemistry between its morally ambiguous characters. Seeing Bucky Barnes, Yelena Belova, Red Guardian, and more navigating their uneasy alliance is pure gold-every interaction crackles with tension, humor, and raw emotion. Their dynamics create an entirely fresh experience within the MCU, proving that heroes aren't the only ones capable of delivering epic storytelling.Action That Hits Hard\nFrom breathtaking hand-to-hand combat to massive set-piece battles, Thunderbolts serves up some of the best action sequences Marvel has ever put on screen. The choreography is intense, the stakes are real, and each moment feels earned. Whether it's Ghost phasing through attacks with devastating precision or Bucky delivering yet another showcase of brutal efficiency, every fight lands with the impact of a thunderbolt itself.A Story Packed With Surprises\nThunderbolts isn't just an action-packed spectacle-it's a deeply compelling story of redemption, power, and loyalty. The film's twists and turns keep audiences on edge, especially with shocking character moments (no spoilers here, but WOW). The way it sets up future MCU projects is brilliantly executed, teasing what's to come without overshadowing the main narrative.Visuals and Score That Elevate the ExperienceMarvel never disappoints in the visual department, and Thunderbolts is no exception. Every frame is meticulously crafted, every effect polished to perfection. The film's darker tone is complemented by an electrifying soundtrack that amplifies every scene. The climactic sequences are nothing short of breathtaking.Final Verdict\nThunderbolts is a 10/10 cinematic achievement** that pushes the boundaries of what an MCU film can be. It's bold, thrilling, and emotionally reson."

A very emotional movie that genuinely had me attached to the characters from the beginning to the end.The antagonist(s) of the film were amazingly well written in my opinion. They produced such a shock factor throughout the movie that I gave a genuine gasp multiple times in the film from being shocked. Thunderbolts* was not afraid to dive into the darker aspects of the film, leaning into some light horror at certain points.Most of the protagonists got a pretty nice, deep look into their character and are pretty fleshed out. Most. Each of them felt unique in their own way, and less stale than the Marvel protagonists of the recent years. There is great character growth and more that happens throughout the field. The genuine emotion these characters made me feel made me almost cry. Twice. I can't name a Marvel project that has pulled that off since Endgame.Overall, Thunderbolts* is a great movie. Perfect? No. But an amazing stepping stone and that has given me hope in Marvel projects once again."

          "content": "Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts is a meaty departure from the standard superhero model. By pairing gritty antihero relationships with government surveillance, the movie moves into a morally gray area, humanizing flawed characters and offering an earthy, high-risk tale. While the MCU is known for colorful heroes and light-hearted fare, Thunderbolts takes a darker palette of colors-visually and thematically-which is one of the film's biggest assets.1. Depth of Character and Dynamic - A Group of Broken MirrorsIn contrast to the Avengers, Thunderbolts are not do-good heroes. They're assassins, mercenaries, and traumatized soldiers burdened by guilt, regret, and manipulation. Characters like Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier), Taskmaster, and Red Guardian are not simply fighters-they are survivors. Their dynamics are not friendship built on shared purpose, but shared damage. Yelena's sharp sarcasm and lingering grief over Natasha, Bucky's ongoing struggle with PTSD, and Red Guardian's tarnished shine all lead to a team dynamic that is unstable and realistic.This emotional depth is what makes them compelling. Audiences are not being shown idealized heroes but people who have been manipulated, used, and are being given second chances-though not necessarily at their own behest. This complicates their narratives and makes them more reflective of actual power relations.2. Control, Redemption, and Government Manipulation ThemesThunderbolts is, at its core, a critique of institutions that use human beings as tools. Characters like Taskmaster, a mind-controlled victim, and Bucky, a former Hydra assassin, reinforce the psychic bite of losing control. Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, a shadowy government agent rallying the team, is a counter to Nick Fury-she's not assembling Earth's finest heroes, but Earth's most expensive liabilities. The film is playing tricks on the notion of redemption, but not as something to be admired, but instead as an image-saving or survival effort.This is thematic subtlety which elevates the film from simple action fare. It questions whether it is possible for redemption to be achieved for those forced to do evil by command-and if so, whether the system that rendered them powerless is willing to permit them to recover, or just re-use them.3. Tone and Aesthetic - MCU's Suicide Squad Done RightThough comparisons to DC's Suicide Squad are inevitable, Thunderbolts forms a different identity. Where Suicide Squad revels in chaos and satire, Thunderbolts opts for moral ambiguity and cold hard realism. The action scenes themselves are more about brutality than spectacle. The color palette-gritty greys, blues, and earth tones-is a reflection of the internal darkness of the characters and the dirty politics that bracket the mission.Instead of quick-witted dialogue and humor to propel the story, the humor is understated and dry, befitting a team that is not here to save the world, but to clean up after others refuse to take responsibility for being.4. Performances and Character ArcsFlorence Pugh is excellent in her role as Yelena, finishing dry wit with deep emotional subtext. She is intense in each scene, making Yelena an emotional anchor for the group. Sebastian Stan's Bucky also shines, depicting a man hovering between soldier and human. His restrained scenes, filled with haunted looks and restraint, give Thunderbolts emotional weight.David Harbour's Red Guardian is comic relief and tragic flashback at the same time, a man clinging to past significance. Taskmaster (hopefully being fleshed out more than in Black Widow) is reimagined in tragic terms to justify rewriting her past (I know she died fast but still played an important part in Ghost and Yelena). And Valentina, played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, has chilly glamour, manipulating puppet master with unnerving ease.5. Pacing and Story - Leaner and More FocusedOne of the strong points of Thunderbolts is its bare-bones storytelling. While most MCU movies become unwieldy with subplots and cameos, Thunderbolts keeps things tight with its main cast and plot. The story is about a secret mission that goes awry and leaves the team dealing with both outside threats and inside suspicion.The tension isn't from a monstrosity beam suspended in the air or from danger to the multiverse-it's from ethical dilemmas, betrayal, and survival. It's thriller-spy, not superhero epic, and that is a welcome relief.6. Why It Worked - Subversion and RealismUltimately, Thunderbolts succeeds because it subverts expectations. It's not about world-saving but world-cleaning. It shows the aftermath of war, the scars of service, and the moral murkiness of doing what you're told \"for the greater good.\" In an era of superhero fatigue, where audiences crave complexity over perfection, Thunderbolts offers a grounded, character-driven story that proves the MCU can still take risks.Through the focus on un-neat redemption, through the demonstration that systems of power decay as much as they function to safeguard, and through a more intimate, morally complicated narrative, Thunderbolts redefines what a team-up film in the MCU can do.Final Verdict: 8.5/10Thunderbolts is not the flashiest of Marvel films-but it does not have to be. It's savage, cynical, and full of emotional depth. For those who tire of gods and multiverses, this is the messy, human storytelling that the MCU needed."

          "content": "This is a perfect showcase how deep the MCU has fallen, when this is supposed to be a good MCU movie now. It's true, if I squint a lot ignoring flaws it is decent. It has some nice scenes - action and character moments - some fun banter and a plot and villain that at least tries to be more than a punching bag for the heroes, something with depth. The problem is, those are rare small sparks and in the overall product they feel forced and dragged out, like not enough butter over too much bread. This is the most true of Yelena and her \"character development\", arguably the character to carry the plot and movie the most. It feels so shoehorned in to try and turn her into the role her sister filled trying to mix this into her own arc of realizing that you can do more than kill for money and the job. Which feels weird since she already was beyond that in Black Widow and the Hawkeye series arguably and those pivotal moments from both the movie and the series barely feel connected to her current situation. The main plot has multiple moments that make either the main characters or the villains feel incredibly stupid without making it explainable by character flaws. Thor in its original movie being a dickhead is part of his character arc and that explains some of the \"bad decisions\" he makes. Here that works for some characters, but then it's inexplicable why others in the same group follow along. There is superficial conflict in the characters, that is swept aside when convenient but so much potential lost in dealing with actual conflicts or finding different solutions to the main problems to fuel their banter. The main villain and their plot line, such a good premise, and I give it that they at least go a bit further than with WandaVision and actually stick with the more interesting resolution than beating up a villain to resolve it - in essence. However, the plot still feels idiotic and underwhelming. On the positive side, some small aspects managed to subvert expectations - the problem is, mostly the change feels more cringe than the cliche plotline it replaces (with another cliche, mostly dumb side-villain or hero). The ending is pretty unsatisfying and setting up the next movies in the canon universe with more problems. We have a say, ambivalent, character with superman level powers rivaling if not surpassing the established heroes and villains, the sub-villain is still around and could actually spin the whole movie plot as a win for themselves (despite not getting exactly what they wanted, granted) - so on that front nothing is resolved. It feels the purpose of the movie solely was to form the team. And it was pretty tedious or that. Normally the team introduction movies are fun. All in all there is too much stuffed into this movie again, trying to please everyone with quirky references, different types of plots (a bit political thriller, a bit mental health, a bit classical villain, a bit purpose finding etc) and in the process at least not pleasing me. For like about half the movie I was somewhat entertained, the other half I was actively annoyed. There are two reasons I didn't walk out: I had to spend the time anyway waiting for a travel connection and I could use my phone in the theater to distract me. If that's not a damning summary, I don't know what is. I guess going on a rampage. Now, part of my annoyance might stem from the fact that the trailers at least gave some hope and the movie had it's moments where it looked like it could find its way, but then it would drag on and torpedo all its progress again..."

Oh, there was a team of wisecracking antiheroes, thrown together by circumstance and forced to confront a common enemy. But they're wisecracking antiheroes who have to grapple with their own demons if they're going to save the day.It could have been a much darker, more ponderious movie if they hadn't got the tone right.

Although tears and praise come out of me, I have to admit there are a few improvements this movie could take:1. When the rest of the team enters the Void, it doesn't show any scene development, rather than suddenly appearing while Yelena and Bob were in the attic. You could add how they got into the Void, face their fears, so that the plot thickens.2. Taskmaster was killed off too fast, we haven't gotten to known her entire story, if she had survived, we would have gotten to explore the character's personality and embrace her into the MCU.3. In the post-credits scene, there is a scene where the Fantastic Four ship appears in Earth-19999, this however spoils some of the details of the upcoming movie \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\". Marvel Studios shouldn't have been too eager to show that to the audience as to add suspense and thriller.So after my essay review of this movie, I would rate an 7.8/10, which would mark up to IMDb's standards."

A top spy-assassin who had childhood years in USA having an heavy accent? I really hated that in Hawkeye, where I also thought Yelena was the second worst character after that piece of wood called Echo. I also her acting really stiff and forced but that also was not the case with Thunderbolts. Surprisingly she is an interesting, well written and well played character in this movie and big win for Florence Pugh, who really put an impressive performance.Lewis Pullman is also incredible as how he can shift from vulnerable to menacing, powerful to the meek. It was an incredible performance that kinda made the movie.Hannah John-Kamen played ava, whom I know her from Killjoys, a show started stong but gone meh after few years. I think the movie underutilized her and her character a bit but it's understandable, there's so much you can do with a limited runtime.Wyatt Russel, as John Walker, who I think the most, and sadly only, interesting character from Falcon and Winter soldier, did also an amazing performance. Movie did address past sins of the show quite a bit, half-heartedly but it's there. His character shaped from arrogant righteous a**hole (which he wields as a shield from reality, no pun intended), to a person that returns to his root after his past failures as a protector.Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes, while still wears the gravitas and the psyche of winter soldier like a hat, but he and his metal arm feels a bit... rusted. Don't know if it was the fight choreography done him dirty, or him not being that young anymore, it was a step down from civil war and what came before that. Apart from that, I believe it's a solid performance.David Harbour, as Red Guardian. His scenes were mostly cheesy and a lot of \"marvel humour\" went into that. Yet he delivers good acting and his scenes with Yelena delivers good emotional punch.I tried to make general statements avoiding spoilers, but now:\nSPOILERS (and the bad)\nThat 2 minute timer and having power source for \"sound barrier\" inside of the room... was \"intellectually challenged\" at best. That tension could have implemented far better and takes a lot from the movie."

I used to love MCU offerings but recent fare has been POOR (Brave New World absolutely scraping the barrel IMHO). The first hour it was 'same old, same old' (albeit Florence Pugh is a wonderfully sparky actor who makes anything watchable) but then something switched. Out of the formulaic paint by numbers landscape emerged a searing examination of mental health and what it means to care. A gentle handling of a very serious topic. By far the most intelligent MCU movie and one that caught me entirely by surprise. Bravo."

          "content": "Bruh, they stole \"Bob\" from \"Top Gun:Maverick\"...TWICE!! This was a shockingly good movie though! I enjoyed the good character dynamics and depth. Particularly with the flashbacks given to each character, and making the \"Bob\" character sympathetic and likeable before going down a literal darker path with the void. (That makes you root against him going that way and want the best for him). Speaking of which this movie has the most TERRIFYING MCU climax if you think about it. (Like is the entire city temporarily trapped in their own bad memories and depression?! That's not scary at all 😨😅) Yet the visuals in that third act with the void might be the most creative visuals since \"Doctor Strange\". This is the probably best of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine too! (Who is deliciously manipulative in the film). It has the cool action you expect in a Marvel movie (Bucky has a sick action entrance!) Most of all this film carried surprisingly heartfelt messages in moving on with your mistakes and regrets, redemption, how to face depression, and comforting the lonely (the last of which was done quite beautifully). I think these messages might be why so many people are responding well to the movie. (Because it is relatable!) It was bummer that they killed off taskmaster so quickly though. It felt a bit like mismarketing having her as one of the members of the team in the trailers and a bit of a waste as her abilities could have been used in an interesting way with the rest of the team. 🤷‍♂️ (Oh well, silver lining is maybe now we can get a comic accurate taskmaster in a future movie. \"Real Mandarin\" style) I would say the film does not really pick up until \"Bob\" comes into the picture. And I do not know whether to take the Thubderbolts as the \"new avengers\" seriously or a joke because the ending of the film seemed to play it off as serious and then comedically . Which sends mixed messaging to me especially if their back door marketing campaign was making it \"*the new avengers\" Btw none-like Marvel I actually put a spoiler warning on my review 😅 (But if they are the New Avengers that makes more sense of the Avengers 5 cast announcement to me). Overall though one of the better recent MCU entries that I really enjoyed and took a couple positive messages from it."

This film feels less like a team-up of antiheroes and more like a stitched-together mess of character leftovers, half-baked storylines, and the kind of bland spectacle that makes you wonder if the MCU is officially running on fumes.Let's start with the team itself. You'd think a crew featuring Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Taskmaster, and U. S. Agent would bring at least a spark of chemistry. Instead, every scene between them is painfully awkward, with forced quips, zero emotional stakes, and pacing that lurches like it was edited by committee. Yelena, once the witty heart of Black Widow, is reduced to eye-rolls and recycled sarcasm. Bucky, somehow still brooding after 30 movies, looks like even he doesn't want to be there."

THE CHARACTERS know they're not your favorite characters, and instead of trying to compensate with guest spots and callbacks, it delves into what it's like to be underestimated, unwanted and even hated. Brilliantly done.Even better, the movie uses the checkered (and in some cases incredibly bleak) pasts of these unloved characters and makes it their strength. Not in a cheesy \"what doesn't kill me makes me stronger\" way, but in the way that trauma actually becomes a strength -by confronting it, dealing with it, and eventually learning to accept it as a part of who you are. This was so thoughtfully done that I at times forgot about the superpowers and truly just identified with the human on the screen.Lastly, \"Bob\" was amazing. Not only was his character deep, complex and extremely raw, he was familiar. This was a major Marvel summer feature, and they took the time (and remarkable acting craft) to make a palpable depiction of person with complex overplayed mental health struggles in a way that never felt rushed or cartoonish. His pain was never an imediment to the plot. Instead, his struggle WAS the core struggle of the film. Between Yelena's grief, Walker's self-imposed isolation, and Bob's unraveling psyche, this was as much about our common struggle as.it was about an unearthly conflict. It wasn't my favorite Marvel movie of all time (that's an insanely high bar), but it was to me a perfect film. 10/10."

From the moment the film begins, it grabs your heart and never lets go, weaving a story that's equal parts thrilling and deeply emotional. The ensemble cast-led by standout performances from Sebastian Stan, Florence Pugh, and David Harbour-brings raw vulnerability and chemistry that makes every character feel like family. Their flaws, struggles, and triumphs resonate on a profoundly human level, turning a team of misfits into heroes you can't help but root for.The direction by Jake Schreier is impeccable, balancing high-octane action with quiet, poignant moments that linger long after the credits roll. The cinematography is stunning, with gritty, grounded visuals that amplify the stakes of every mission. The score, pulsing with intensity and heart, perfectly complements the film's emotional depth. What sets Thunderbolts apart is its fearless exploration of redemption, loyalty, and found family, delivering a narrative that feels both epic and intimately personal.Every twist hits like a lightning bolt, keeping you on the edge of your seat, while the humor-sharp and perfectly timed-adds warmth without undercutting the drama. This isn't just a superhero movie; it's a love letter to second chances and the power of connection. Thunderbolts is flawless, unforgettable, and easily one of Marvel's finest achievements. I laughed, I cried, and I left the theater inspired-a rare and beautiful experience."

Even though I missed the IMAX experience, the thrill and enjoyment of the movie were profound and undiminished in any format. Being the only ardent Marvel fan in my circle of family and friends, I deeply long for someone to watch and dissect every intricate detail with along with indulging in the cinematic wonder together. My view of John Walker has undergone a remarkable transformation; despite my initial disdain for him during his portrayal in \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,\" his newfound character development has made him my favorite. This shift truly highlights how exceptional writing can entirely reshape audience perception of a once-unliked character into one who captures their admiration. I'm also elated to see Bucky finally receive a theme song that resonates perfectly with his character's journey, encapsulating his evolution throughout the Marvel universe."

It's not just another superhero team-up; it's a raw, emotional, and powerful character journey that hits deep. I honestly didn't expect to learn this much from a Marvel film - especially not from a cast of so-called \"broken\" characters.Each of the Thunderbolts - from Yelena and Bucky to Ghost and Red Guardian - came into this movie scarred, burdened, and carrying regrets. But through the chaos, betrayal, and tough choices, they started to heal, and that was beautiful to watch. They weren't just antiheroes anymore by the end; they became actual people you could root for. They felt real. I found myself connecting with them on a personal level - especially Bucky and Ghost. Their struggles felt like mirrors to some of my own. It was powerful.Except... Taskmaster. Man. Why'd you have to kill Taskmaster, bruh? I really thought we were going to see more growth there. She had so much potential, and while her final moments were impactful, it still hurt to see her go. Hopefully there's still a twist coming (never say never in the MCU), but that was a tough one.Now, let's talk about Sentry - peak introduction. Lewis Pullman nailed it. Bob Reynolds is one of the most complex and dangerous characters in Marvel lore, and they handled his debut perfectly. The way they portrayed the Void, the internal battle, and the way the team came together to help him rather than just stop him? That was next-level storytelling. Emotional. Tense. Human.Also, the political twist with Valentina and the rebranding of the Thunderbolts as \"New Avengers\"? Chilling. You know that's going to come back around hard in Avengers: Doomsday, and I'm hyped to see how this team fits into the larger MCU picture.Overall, me and my friends really enjoyed Thunderbolts* - we laughed, we were on the edge of our seats, and we got emotionally wrecked in the best way. This isn't just a fun movie - it's a story about redemption, identity, and finding family in unexpected places. And it proves that sometimes, the heroes you need aren't the clean-cut ones in capes - they're the ones who've been through hell and are still standing.Marvel, you did something special here. Bring on Avengers: Doomsday."

          "content": "Thunderbolts Doesn't Fight Monsters. It Fights Depression, Trauma, and Isolation\nThunderbolts* is unlike anything we've seen before in a superhero blockbuster. Its bold focus on mental health is the beating heart of the film, shaping the story in a way that's refreshingly original. We've had plenty of superhero (and anti-hero) movies, but none have tackled mental health as deeply or as honestly as this. This is as fresh as it gets, and the film hits its message squarely on the mark. Could that message have been louder or more powerful? Absolutely. But is it enough for audiences to understand, feel, and reflect on? Without a doubt. It's a gem that invites viewers to empathize, to look inward, and to recognize the struggles of those around them. In many ways, Thunderbolts feels like a superhero in its own right, delivering a powerful PSA that's woven seamlessly into the narrative rather than feeling tacked on.We're in love with the concept here; an anti-hero film built around mental health. It makes the story and the character arcs far deeper and more meaningful than they'd be if these were just your typical caped crusaders. Thunderbolts* is the MCU's rawest exploration of mental health to date. We've heard the words \"trauma\" and \"healing\" tossed around in superhero flicks before like WandaVision, but this is different. This film doesn't just mention the weight of mental health, it lives in it. Yelena's story, in particular, has been carefully nurtured since Phase 4, and the decision to continue her journey down this road is nothing short of brilliant. Yelena, like Black Widow before her, isn't a superhero with powers. She's human. She's flawed, resilient, and painfully relatable and that makes her journey hit even harder.We actually like the character dynamics between the anti-heroes. We like that every of their personality shines. Their dynamics push the film's mental health themes even further. These might have been the underdogs of previous movies, characters we barely remembered but here, they get their moment. And wow, do they deliver. Each one gets time to prove they're so much more than sidekicks or forgotten faces and by the end, you can't help but root for them.What's especially moving is how much these characters matter both to themselves and to each other. They've all been torn down, denigrated, beaten back, and made to feel like the world is against them. They're loners by nature, forced into the uncomfortable space of working as a team for the first time. Watching them navigate that, to lean on each other when things fall apart, is both heartwarming and powerful. It's a clear reminder of the importance of friendship, of admitting when you need help, and of realizing that none of us can do it all alone.The action sequences in this are great. It's a blast watching everyone throw down and show off their skills. But here's the thing, while the action is awesome, it's not what makes this film great. This movie proves that a superhero film doesn't need to lean on endless explosions to leave an impact. The story itself is raw, human, and beautifully told and that is more than enough. That's why Thunderbolts* stands tall in the post-Endgame era. The action is tight, but the storytelling is what really puts it over the top.And guess what? They didn't rely on cameos. We could safely say that Deadpool vs Wolverine, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Thunderbolts* are the top 3 films after Avengers Endgame but what Thunderbolts* sets apart from the other two is it's the only one that doesn't rely on cameos. It doesn't need nostalgic bait, it doesn't need 'help' from anyone, it's just them trying to save the day and trying to figure out how to solve the problems they are in. And we love them for it.Florence Pugh, as always, is a knockout. She's never missed a beat, and once again, she's phenomenal here. Her accent might not be perfect, but who cares? She's a powerhouse, carrying the weight of a character struggling with identity and searching for meaning. She's the voice of so many who feel lost or stuck, and Pugh brings that to life with so much heart. She's a beacon of hope, a reminder that even when it feels impossible, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The rest of the cast? Stellar too. Lewis Pullman deserves a special shoutout. He proves here that he's a force to be reckoned with. Forget the early skepticism about his casting. He owns it completely, and Hollywood seriously needs to give this guy more credit.And yes, Malaysia plays a huge role in this film and the Menara Merdeka 118 shot is breathtaking. Instead of the usual sunny, warm tones we often see, the film opts for a moodier palette blue, dark, and cloudy which beautifully matches the film's somber, reflective theme. It just fits.The third act really dives deep into the mental health themes, in a way that feels raw and personal. The true villain here isn't a monster or alien, it's the demons we all battle inside. It emphasizes this theme in a way that feels plausible, personable and relatable. A villain that lives within all of us. A villain that everyone of us has battled against in some way and some parts in our lives. How much you connect with the film might depend on how you view your life and how much experience you've dealt with but one thing's for sure, it'll leave you thinking long after the credits roll.Was anything wasted in this film? There is one. One character didn't get nearly the spotlight they deserved. Everyone else got their moment to shine except for one and that felt like a missed opportunity.As for the comedy, it's hit and miss. Some of it lands really well. The belly-laugh kind of good while other moments fall flat or feel a bit forced. Some jokes could've used a little more setup, and a few felt repetitive, but overall, there's enough good humor sprinkled in.We did feel like the third act could have fleshed out more. It could have used more breathing room. It moves fast, too fast at times and some moments feel rushed or a bit disjointed. If they'd let things simmer just a bit longer, it could have been even more impactful.And yes, Thunderbolts* has 2 credits scene. The first one is simply light and funny which is bearable enough but the second one will hype everyone up for what's to come. Not that it's important to reveal it at the end credits but with audience losing hope for the future of MCU, this will get everyone back on their feet, cheering and hoping that Phase 6 will be the same with what Phase 3 had to offer...or at least almost.Verdict: Thunderbolts* is the anti-hero film we didn't know we needed. It delivers a story rooted in something we all face: mental health. This is raw. It's personal. And it feels relatable and real. It explores themes of isolation, trauma, and the power of asking for help, making it one of the MCU's most personal stories yet. It ditches the nostalgia bait and focuses on characters wrestling with their own demons, making their journeys relatable and impactful. The action is tight, but it's the emotional weight that truly lands (Yes, we did cry a bit). Florence Pugh leads with power and vulnerability, backed by a stellar cast and the famous Malaysia's Menara Merdeka 118 isn't just cinematic, it symbolizes the towering weight these characters carry. Thank you, Marvel."

While watching the movie, I liked the connection the characters had with each other even more, because none of them were heroes; they had all done bad things, but in the end, they decided to change their past. I also liked that Bucky helped Yelena, Walker, Ava, and Alexie realize that they could save the world, and in the end, they did help him, even though Bob beat them up afterward. In conclusion, it's a very helpful movie because it talks about loneliness and emptiness, and it takes that theme and connects it very well with the humor. Because the movie has great humor. So far, the best Marvel movie of the year."

          "content": "This film was amazing-dare I say a top-five MCU film (in my opinion). They managed to take side characters and make them better than the main characters nowadays.Yelena was the main focus, and even though this is meant to be a film about the entire team, they made everyone feel equal. They were all connected mostly through depression, anger and self-doubt.Bob Aka Sentry Aka Void was my favourite character in the film. He was so funny and shone a light in this dark team. His suit looked like a classic superhero, and I loved it. And The Void... such a peak ahh villain. Need The Void to return.Bucky was a badass and gave off huge Winter Soldier vibes. He's gone through his trauma and was able to help others, but unfortunately, when he formed the team, he didn't feel that important. He just felt like he was thrown straight into the sidelines.It was great seeing Ghost return. She's been gone for the longest, so seeing her return was great. She didn't get to use her powers much due to her frequency weakness. Since she had been absent from the MCU the longest, I felt like she needed more. Like, how did she get recruited? What happened to her when Scott Lang never came back with the quantum stuff she needed?John Walker, another badass. He was alright in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, but he levelled up in Thunderbolts*. He was the character who pretends that everything is fine, but in reality, he is struggling a lot.Red Guardian was alright. Didn't enjoy him much. I didn't enjoy his character a lot in Black Widow, and he's the same in this film. He was a bit better and he was the core of the group, but wasn't my favourite.#JusticeForTaskmaster. Completely wasted. What's the point of putting her in so much marketing just to kill her in not even a minute. Why give her a line? The actor deserves so much more respect. They advertised her and her character so much and she didn't get a lot of popularity. \"Oh just wait for the better Taskmaster\" everyone being sexist ngl. But oh well, we just move on.Valentina, no words. Just annoying and has a very punchable face (no hate to the actor, I'm specifically talking about the character).The action was the best part. It was all so much fun. Especially the 1v1v1v1. That knife getting thrown around the place was a cool move. And before Ghost killed Taskmaster, she threw her so far, and I found that funny. I'm glad they didn't nerf Sent,ry he was done right.This film is a 9.5/10 in my opinion. I feel emotionally connected to this film, going through depression and all that. Definetly one of my favourite Marvel films and obiouvlsy one of the best of the Multiverse Saga. And it didn't need multversal elements.Except for the post-credit scene, which was... Fantastic. So hyped for Avengers: Doomsday."

I'm not saying it's an up and down for the movies, I just find this a pretty strange pattern. Last time was okay, and now we've gotten a very solid movie. Thunderbolts is a very nice conclusion of phase 5 of the Multiverse Saga that seems it's very well prepared of what phase 6 is going to offer. It has introduced us as the new generation to the Avangers pretty well with a nice story that sets the Thunderbolts themselves to the test on forming a new team, great visuals that make the action and the stunts seem exciting, interesting characters that have good traits as criminal redemption, and the fact it has built everything for the ending. While I wouldn't consider the best MCU film, it is a very solid conclusion of phase 5. If you are a fan of the Avengers, then I think you are gonna enjoy this one. I mean sure, it's a group of former criminals, but this is also the best movie to watch in preparation of the events that's going to happen in the next phase. As we're about to enter phase 6, this movie is having me more than hopeful for Doomsday and Secret Wars."

          "content": "After the death of \"Black Widow\" Natasha Romanoff, her adoptive sister Yelena Belova finds herself emotionally numb. She continues to take on missions and live a dangerous life, but happiness eludes her. One day, she receives an assignment from CIA Director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine to eliminate a mysterious enemy known as Ghost, who has infiltrated and stolen classified research data. Unexpectedly, Yelena is attacked by former U. S. Agent John Walker. Amidst the chaos, Taskmaster and a seemingly ordinary man named Bob also appear. In the ensuing confusion, they realize they have been manipulated by Valentina. Facing political scandals and the threat of impeachment, Valentina aims to erase all traces of her secret projects, including Project Sentry. She orchestrates a deadly trap, sending her operatives to eliminate each other. Yelena, Walker, Ghost, and Bob, all former agents of Valentina, are now targets in her scheme.As they escape Valentina's pursuit, these lone wolves, who previously had no connections and even harbored animosity towards each other, are forced to unite against their former boss. Red Guardian, arriving to rescue his goddaughter, dubs this ragtag group the \"Thunderbolts.\" This name, initially a joke referencing Yelena's childhood soccer team, becomes their unofficial moniker.In recent years, Marvel films have experienced a noticeable decline in enthusiasm, starting with the underwhelming performance of \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\" Subsequent projects, including series like \"Secret Invasion\" and films like \"The Marvels,\" have received mixed reactions. Although successes like \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" and \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" have emerged, the overall atmosphere remains subdued.Reflecting this somber tone, \"Thunderbolts*\" opens with a Marvel Studios logo devoid of the usual images of the original Avengers, fading into darkness to match the film's mood.The film is directed by Jake Schreier, known for \"Beef,\" with a screenplay by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo, writers of \"Thor: Ragnarok\" and \"BoJack Horseman,\" respectively. Unsurprisingly, the film exudes a strong sense of nihilism and fatigue. It portrays a story of failures striving to overcome their inner darkness and find redemption, resembling a black comedy.Yelena is introduced standing atop a high-rise, gazing over the city. Her heavy, melancholic expression and the sensation of falling suggest a deep existential despair. Although the plot revolves around a mission, Yelena appears more like someone disillusioned with life.Other characters introduced include John Walker, once Captain America, now reduced to undertaking covert assassinations; Red Guardian, a former Soviet hero now relegated to chauffeuring VIPs; and Mel, Valentina's assistant, who often expresses a cynical worldview.The Marvel universe depicted in \"Thunderbolts*\" is notably bleak. These characters, despite their superhuman abilities, are burdened by disgraceful pasts and a yearning for recognition. Yet, the world remains unforgiving, using them as mere tools.This narrative resonates with many who feel like perpetual underachievers, reflecting the harsh realities of life.Fortunately, the film introduces a beacon of hope: Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier. Having once been a Soviet experiment, he now serves as a U. S. Congressman, symbolizing successful redemption. Even the current Captain America seeks his counsel. Bucky's dramatic motorcycle entrance during a moment of despair revitalizes the team. Alongside the ever-optimistic Red Guardian, he helps Yelena and Walker regain their resolve to expose Valentina's conspiracy.However, they soon realize that even among failures, there are those more unfortunate. Bob, a new character and subject of the \"Sentry Project,\" is an ordinary young man with a history of neglect, addiction, and failed endeavors. Reduced to a recluse, he becomes a test subject in Valentina's experiments. In an early escape scene, Bob's internal struggles are depicted. Walker openly belittles him, while Yelena, though silent, subconsciously deems him incapable. To Bob, both see him as useless-one overtly, the other subtly. Thus, when the team faces a crisis, Bob chooses to stay behind, creating an opportunity for them. It's evident that Bob's actions are driven by a desire to prove his worth.This encapsulates the core theme of \"Thunderbolts*\": the yearning to do more, to take on responsibility, and to be acknowledged. When the team is eventually hailed as the new generation of heroes, Yelena doesn't resort to punishing the villain but instead whispers to Valentina, \"From now on, you'll listen to us.\" For these so-called losers, this represents their much-needed second chance.In terms of character development, \"Thunderbolts*\" excels. Yelena's emotional journey is compelling, portraying vulnerability and melancholy that evoke empathy. John Walker's portrayal of a failed man is equally impactful. Bob, as the Sentry, adds depth to the narrative. Conversely, Ghost's role feels peripheral, mainly serving as comic relief and occasional support. Taskmaster's presence is even more fleeting, exiting the story shortly after introduction.Bucky serves as the team's moral compass and symbol of redemption, while Red Guardian provides comic relief and emotional support. David Harbour's performance, especially in scenes comforting Yelena, adds warmth to the group dynamic.Despite its strengths, \"Thunderbolts*\" may not satisfy those seeking a traditional action-packed Marvel film. The climactic battle leans heavily on emotional resolution rather than physical confrontation. Bob's transformation into the Sentry introduces a formidable power, but the team's struggle against him is brief. The focus shifts to saving Bob from his inner darkness, with Yelena attempting to reach out to him. However, aside from Yelena, the other team members lack significant interactions with Bob, making their collective support feel less convincing. This diminishes the impact of the film's resolution.Nonetheless, \"Thunderbolts*\" offers a refreshing take on the superhero genre, emphasizing character depth and emotional resonance over spectacle. The ensemble of flawed individuals striving for redemption provides a compelling narrative, arguably more engaging than the polished heroes of the traditional Avengers. However, fans expecting grand battles and triumphant heroics may find this installment diverging from their expectations.Oh, and don't forget to stay until the end-there's a post-credits scene worth watching."

This film completely blew my expectations out of the water, and I couldn't be more happier it did.PLEASE MARVEL, this is the stuff we want! This film showed many aspects from past great projects that the mcu has put out in the past (winter soldier action, avengers banter) and EXPANDED on these to make it its own unique film. This film made me actually care about characters I hadn't really cared about before (Ghost, Walker, Valentina), and I'm really happy they did, cause they are GREAT!The film does a really good job with allowing people to thrive and show themselves in ways we hadn't seen in the past from these characters, and the BANTER between them all was incredible! Made everyone likeable in their own unique ways.The film also just looks great, with the more stunt work and practical effects they used compared to cgi, it's probably the most polished film we have seen since Endgame in that department.It's also probably the most emotional film we have in the mcu (if you don't want to count Endgame or Infinity War, different type of emotional), diving heavily into mental health and depression, whilst also not going so far into it that the film overall is just too sad or depressing to watch, with plenty moments of comedy mixed into it, but actual GOOD comedy, and was still very serious when it needed to be in the scenes that needed it.I'm not going to dive into every character because I would be here forever, but just overall EVERYONE was great in this film with the roles that they had, the Thunderbolts, Valentina, Bob, Mel, EVERYONE did what they were asked of and played their hearts out, huge props to all of the actors for putting on great performances in this film.Overall, I think this film is an awesome watch for anybody who wants to get back into the mcu, and in my opinion is one of the better marvel projects we have gotten. Period!Please go see this movie, and if you can see it in the theatres. I see the film grossing only 300 million and it makes me sad, cause it's clear we are on a marvel fatigue, and people aren't going to see the movie for that reason. But please! We need more films like this, if this can be the new standard for marvel then we can be right back to old consistent mcu.Great job marvel, can't wait to see what Fantastic 4 is going to do in July!Red Guardian: \"We are the THUNDERBOLTS!!\""

In an era where MCU fatigue has been a genuine concern, this film bursts onto the scene as one of the most refreshing and engaging entries in a long, long time.From the moment the titular team assembles, the chemistry is palpable. It bleeds off the screen, elevating every interaction, every quip, and every moment of genuine connection. Thunderbolts* masterfully blends high-octane action sequences with genuinely laugh-out-loud comedy, all while tackling a serious and compelling central theme that gives the film surprising depth. This isn't just a collection of anti-heroes; it's a dysfunctional family you can't help but root for.As expected, Florence Pugh delivers a captivating performance that solidifies Yelena Belova as a truly compelling character. She brings a nuanced blend of vulnerability and badassery that makes her impossible to look away from. And then there's David Harbour, who once again proves he's a screen-stealing maestro. His Red Guardian is a consistent source of comedic gold and unexpected heart, proving that some characters just get better with age.But as the credits roll and the excitement lingers, a single, nagging question remains: is Thunderbolts* truly that damn good, or has it just been that long since we've had an MCU film truly worth talking about? The answer, perhaps, is a little bit of both. Regardless, Thunderbolts* serves as a powerful reminder of the MCU's potential and a hopeful sign that the best may still be yet to come. Don't miss this one."

Red Guardian is as hilarious as ever, Yelena was a great lead for this movie, John Walker on his redemption arc is something lots of people would be happy to see and Bucky was simply badass the whole movie. Ghost was decent, I wish they potentially gave her a bit more attention but I'm happy with the choice of killing Taskmaster immediately, not only due to the dodgy origins, but also create a sense that the members weren't immortal, which is quite easy to think in a superhero movie. Finally, the void was a brilliant villain who had just reasons for he represents all the torment Bob went through, and how he feels when he lets it win. Yelena confronting her dark past was satisfying to watch and the way they brought Void down was believable, which could be very easily butchered but it was done well. It highlights the importance of friendship and how people aren't alone, no matter how sad they may feel.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this movie, and I can't wait to see this cast in Avengers Doomsday!"

          "content": "I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10.Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts marks a confident step into murkier waters, and honestly, that's where the modern MCU tends to shine best. The film brings together a ragtag lineup of antiheroes Yelena Belova, Bucky Barnes, Red Guardian, Ghost, Taskmaster, and John Walker under the reluctant guidance of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. What follows is a surprisingly introspective, if uneven, character driven story that offers more emotional depth than many recent MCU entries.Unlike the last Captain America film, which felt hollow despite its ambition, Thunderbolts actually delivers some substance. The stakes feel personal, the team dynamics are messy in a compelling way, and Florence Pugh continues to prove she's one of the strongest additions to the franchise.That said, the film isn't without its flaws. At times, the writing feels stilted or corny even. There are moments where you can almost feel the script veering into AI generated territory, lacking the natural wit and rhythm we've come to expect from Marvel at its best.One of the more interesting deviations from comic canon is the handling of Bucky Barnes. While some fans (myself included) may have hoped to see him take up the Captain America mantle as he did in the comics, this pivot doesn't feel like a complete loss. Bucky's arc here wrestling with his past and his place in a world without Steve Rogers, feels grounded, even if it's not the version some envisioned.Perhaps most refreshing is the spotlight given to Marvel's so called \"small time\" characters. Ghost and Taskmaster, once considered background noise in the larger Avengers narrative, get moments to breathe and matter. It's a reminder that some of the MCU's most interesting stories don't always revolve around gods and galactic empires.Thunderbolts may not be a perfect film it's flawed, a little awkward, and tonally conflicted but in its messiness, there's something honest. It's the MCU experimenting, letting characters explore the grey areas of heroism, and that's worth applauding.I'm Rae Serbeck, I Watch and Review all Movies Large and Small!"

The Russian accents definitely help to add the punch to the humour which I found funny so that was great.We got to truly see the power of sentry which was awesome to see and maybe they do have a point on being stronger than all the avengers together. The depiction of him was badass and he looked like a true death bringer.The cast was amazing for this movie and hopefully they can stay together for the future \"avenger\" movies, chemistry on point and they give a good wide range of personalities that each can bring to make themselves standout and be remembered.Man I just wish Bucky would do more badass stuff, like I feel he is being held back or maybe I'm over hyping of what he truly is but still man. Metal arm man.Overall, it was a amazing and fun movie that marvel has been seriously lacking, the story was great, the cast was great, action scenes were fire, sentry portrayed was amazing to see and they all had a arch of friendship.I would really recommend watching it. Future of marvel hopefully."

Especially in the ending which is very sly and fast. From a technical point of view, the direction is sold, comprehensible. The visual effects are coexisting and credible."

Unfortunately, this movie is of course not the best for ONE big reason. It was very short. If movie was only 15 minutes bigger could have to set better 1) the \"love\" between BOB and thunderbolts at the end of the movie 2) also the gost could have set better. I understand that we have seen him in a movie but with only 2 minutes someone who hasn't saw antman 2 wouldn't have any questions. To end up the movie is good really good but have some issues. I recommend it to someone you want an emotional movie bad also with marvel's style."

We had made a deal to go see it if the ratings stayed high after the super fans had already gone and seen it, and after two weeks, it was at 7.6 stars on IMDb!We. Weren't. Disappointed.Thunderbolts* is the best Marvel movie since No Way Home! The characters were amazing, and do you know why?They. Had. Flaws. Flaws that made them relatable. Flaws that made them HUMAN. Flaws that made you LOVE THEM. If a character doesn't have flaws, then what's the point? Nobody relates to a perfect character.Bob was spectacular! He was hilarious and awkward and just a little sweetheart! Yelena was clever and kind (to Bob) and just wanted a friend. The rest, you're just going to have to watch and find out!The story was amazing! The moral was DEEEP. There were nearly NO plot holes or goofs or parts that left us confused! There were perfect things to theorize on and ponder about.There storytelling was spot-on. The cinematography was good! There were parts that didn't use cgi!It wasn't too violent, but a little dark. It had just enough comedy to keep parts light when it was needed.I. Was. Amazed.I would definitely go see it again! Even though we missed like 2 minutes if it because the power at the theater went out...\nBut please, go see Thunderbolts*.Marvel has finally remembered how to make good movies."

I'm not hating on it and if you enjoy it....good for you.This Film is not that special imo. Sure it has a deeper meaning and nice message but it was executed very poorly. Hell, it wasn't even a Thunderbolts Film but more a Florence Pugh Solo Movie (She's my favourite Actress). All the other characters were just there. Taskmaster....well you know it. Ghost.....who tf cares? Red Guardian.... One cool scene and the rest is just generic not funny marvel jokes. Us Agent....i never understood why people see him as a bad guy. And then Bucky. A Character who is only in the movie so they have one of the ,,Old\" Avengers in it. Bob was cool though. None of the characters, except yelena, had any connection to Bob. So the scene where ,,Friends can get you out of darkness\" makes literally no sense. Why do they care for him?! Seconds ago he was terrorizing New York.And of course there is the ending......WHY ARE THEY THE NEW AVENGERS?!? Their Goal was to capture Valentina cause they did all of them dirty (again, this was buckys only motivation at all). Yet in the End they were like ,,Mhhmm we're not putzing you in prison cause you made us the avengers😎\"It's not a bad Film. Don't get me wrong i think its worth watching and not THE example to show why Mcu isn't hitting anymore. But i just don't agree with the hype about and calling it a 9 out of 10 Film."

          "content": "1. Overall Plot - 4/10\nThe plot was not that great in this film. I like the idea of Anti-Heroes working together in almost a Suicide Squad type team, but they didn't execute it as well as it could have been. I like the beginning of the film a lot, and they did a great job setting up the team and the plot, but from there it kind of went downhill. The second half of the film was very, very weak. And other than one cool action sequence, not much actually happened. The movie also has no stakes, consequences, or impacts of any kind. It is also one of, if not the most, predictable super hero movies I have ever seen. Another thing I didn't like was that the movie felt way too much of a depression PSA. We get it the first time. You don't have to do it over, and over, and over again. Especially in the same act...2. Entertainment / Engagement - 9/10\nThe story and characters not being my favorite doesn't change the fact that this movie is still very fun to watch. It is by far its biggest redeeming quality. There is a good mix of humor, seriousness, and action. Because I didn't really care too much about many of the characters, I wasn't super engaged, but still was pretty entertained throughout. Sentry was very entertaining to watch.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 5/10\nThis movie has a ton of emotional drive to it, but it isn't executed well at all. It is force shoved down your throat to the point that it is just annoying. The whole movie feels like a massive depression PSA instead of just focusing on telling a good story. Every time you start to get sick of it and say, ok I get it move on, they just double down and do it again. This is what makes the movie suffer the most, and just makes it very forgettable, and not needed.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 5/10\nThe theme for this one is obviously depression and mental health. The movie really tries to be deep and go into the deeper meaning of depression, but it just misses so hard. Instead it feels like a shallow info commercial. Like they make it feel deep at first, but when you really think about the movie the more you realize that it just feels so fake and exaggerated to the point that it is just annoying.5. Characters - 6/10\nI really don't care for any of the characters in this movie other than Bucky. The Thunderbolts team is made up of side characters from basically only trash MCU projects. Two from Black Widow, which is one of the worst marvel movies. One from Ant-Man and the Wasp, and that movie isn't very good either. And then one from the Falcon and Winter Soldier show, which I didn't like either. I really don't like that they focused the most on Yelena. I don't need to hear about her sob story over and over again. The whole movie got me saying womp womp.6. Acting / Writing - 6/10\nThe acting was pretty average. I am not a fan of Florence Pugh's acting. It isn't bad, but it just isn't great either. The Actress for Valentina was terrible. It was like she's never acted before. It was pretty bad, and one of the worst acting performances in the MCU. What is stopping this from being a four or a three is Lewis Pullman as Bob. His acting was great and carried the movie. His character was intriguing from the first moment we see him. I also really enjoyed watching Sentry, but I wish we got to see much more of him and less of Void.7. Cinematography / Sets - 7/10\nNothing special. Just average, but still good. I loved the way they had Void take people to the void. It was very cool.8. Score / Sound - 7/10\nPretty average. Nothing stuck out to me. Kind of forgettable music.9. Editing / Pace - 2/10\nThe editing was fine. The pacing was terrible. It starts out good, and I like the way the team meets. But even that was rushed and had no buildup to it. And then the movie didn't really even have a climax. It just kind of ended very disappointedly. There was no big action fight scene or anything to keep you wanting more.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 9/10\nThe effects in this movie were very good. I loved the minimal use of CGI. And the CGI they did have were actually good. I particularly loved the Sentry effects. They make him feel so powerful, which he should. The void effects are also very cool. The first use of them and the first shock is insane. It was the best part of the movie by far.Average Score:\n6/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:\n6.7/10\nI had low expectations for this movie. And it delivered about what I was expecting. I don't get why people are saying this movie is great, when it just isn't. It is pointless, lacks a real plot and climax, and is the most predictable MCU movie. It is still an enjoyable watch, and isn't bad by any means, but its nothing spectacular. It's a movie that just has no stakes, consequences or any real impact on the overall MCU."

Of course, it has MCU shenanigans mixed in, but the movie's core is worth it.The casting is excellent. Florence Pugh is the pack's leader, but the group has great chemistry. I was not expecting to like Wyatt Russell's John Walker, but it works great as the group's a-hole. Hannah's Ghost clearly has the least to do, but even she has her proper place as an essential piece in the team.David Harbour and Sebastian Stan only play larger roles in the second half of the movie, but they do deliver. David, in particular, as usual, gives his all, and it shows. Fortunately, the character fits him like a glove. It's great stuff.As per usual in a Marvel movie, yes, there is a lot of CGI, and yes, they show off a lot of good fighting choreography. We expect that. But they have been at fault in one crucial place: the screenplay.It's always incoherent, unnecessary, and cluttered with nonsense; it all feels like it was written by a committee. There is no authorship, artistry, subtlety, or anything else.Not this time. This movie feels small in scope, but it's coherent. A proper theme runs throughout the movie, permeating the character development arcs. The plot follows the theme, and it doesn't feel bureaucratic.Risking entering spoiler territory, this is not another Suicide Squad or Guardians of the Galaxy. It's not a ragtag team of misfits learning to work together despite differences.In this case, they are all alike, and this is the movie's genius: they are all emotionally disconnected, feeling failure, disappointment, and a lack of a larger purpose. The screenplay touches on complex themes like anxiety, boredom, and depression.It's easy to fall into the usual clichés, but this screenplay is smart. It's self-aware, and it visually binds the emotional rollercoaster in the plot and the action, so it doesn't feel like a lecture or yet another YouTube coaching.They even tie in the villain to this theme, and I think it works very well to wrap everything up. I was amazed to see a medium-budget Marvel movie go this deep and still maintain coherence until the end.The casting responded very well to this theme, which made them bond naturally. The plot drives the character development. And there is a satisfying catharsis at the end that feels deserved-all ingredients of a good screenplay.This is nowhere near Avengers territory regarding scope, and I don't think it needs to be. This feels more like an intimate, personal story, and it's good because of that.Kudos to the writers; they nailed it. Despite the name not meaning anything important, Thunderbolts has its own identity, and it doesn't try to be yet another Suicide Squad. It's much better.A very well-deserved 8 out of 10 from me."

          "content": "Since multiple executives from the Marvel/Disney firmament have specifically said they don't make movies for ME, my interest in Marvel movies has waned. A bigger factor, of course, is the all time cooler the MCU has mostly been on the past several years. Black Widow (garbage), Eternals (appropriately titled overlong garbage), Black Panther 2 (stupid garbage - I'm giving you 7 days to prepare yourself before I return and do the thing I should do right now), Ant Man Quantumania (big smelly garbage), The Marvels (laughable garbage), etc.Thunderbolts* is a mostly pleasant return to form for the Super Hero factory. Don't get me wrong. It doesn't measure up to Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk (hey, I liked it), any of the Spider-Man films, The Guardians movies (the best of the MCU), three of the four Avengers titles, Black Panther, the Captain America flicks or Deadpool & Wolverine, etc. Considering Thunderbolts* is packed to the gills with characters no one truly cares about (c'mon, be honest), I was surprised at how well it turned out.As is often the case with these movies, Thunderbolts* takes a little too long to pick up speed. When it does the first two acts are a decidedly lo-fi effort for an MCU offering. This allows for some well choreographed hand to hand combat scenes to resonate while all typically climaxing in the requisite Super Hero draw. There's also a high octane car chase through the dessert punctuated with good humour and a large sized nod to The Dark Knight.The script treads familiar MCU territory as each character grapples with various personal demons while all seemingly having the exact same back story. I suppose well adjusted Super Heroes would make for a boring film. At times MCU moral philosophizing can drag a film down. In this case soundbites like, \"There's a good guy and a worse guy and nothing else,\" made me think about the average nightly newscast in 2025.The crux of the plot revolves around a new character named Bob who later goes on to be called Homelander (actually The Sentry). It is with Bob that the third act of Thunderbolts* goes dark both figuratively and literally. The tonal shift goes slightly overboard and certainly wasn't even hinted at in the bombardment of trailers for Thunderbolts*.Jake Schreier manages to deftly balance his cast of misfits with a fairly abrupt shift from comedy to drama. Thunderbolts* is able to straddle these two solitudes through the power of Yelena's (Florence Pugh) pathos and the Red Guardian's (David Harbour) exuberant optimism.These second rate heroes likely can't sustain an entire phase of the MCU. That said, they did make for a fun yet contemplative yarn that takes its place in the middle of the Marvel pack. Not a bad place to be after a five plus year malaise."

          "content": "For a while, the answer to \"Should I give Marvel another shot?\" was a hard no. Since Endgame, the studio has released 14 films - only two of which (Black Widow and No Way Home) were worth the time. Thunderbolts changes that.Don't start here if you're new. This one's for the faithful. Most of its strength comes from reengagement - revisiting flawed but compelling characters with richer perspective.The marketing was bold. Three days after release, the poster literally changed in my theater. The IMAX countdown even teased Fantastic Four iconography. Marvel's been messy lately, but this was clean. Tactile. Measured.Florence Pugh takes center stage. Her performance is jagged, endearing, and a little infuriating - which works. She doesn't replace Scarlett Johansson, but she doesn't have to. David Harbour, meanwhile, gives a performance that transcends genre. His Red Guardian walks the line between parody and sincerity - something few actors pull off in this space.Wyatt Russell and Sebastian Stan return with mixed results. Russell in particular gets overwritten dialogue, but manages to muscle through the physical demands.Also - where is Agent 13?Comparisons to Suicide Squad are inevitable, but lazy. Thunderbolts has roots. The government villain (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) isn't just a puppetmaster - she's a bureaucratic menace. A Lex Luthor in a pantsuit.Marvel still can't resist stuffing ski masks on background extras. It's lazy. And distracting. But despite that and other small missteps, Thunderbolts works.It's not perfect. But it's real. And it earns Marvel one more shot."

          "content": "The MCU genre is not known for its self-help proclivities, but surprisingly the film breaks into the arena of battling inner turmoil while saving the world as well. Just when you think you know where this film might be going (another avengers' mission to stop world domination) it takes an unconventional route and the archetypal MCU narrative is subverted to make way for something more grounded and insightful and for that, I applaud this.You don't have to have a history of anxiety, depression or even an abusive childhood to find this film's underlying concept impactful. There is also the familiar theme of exploitation of those who feel alienated and forgotten by playing on their fears, resentments and hopes for redemption.It's all hands on deck here. Florence Pugh is alternately nonchalant and fierce. Sebastian Stan brings his trademark rugged charisma and David Harbour has a ball. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is the Machiavellian voice of authority. But it is Lewis Pullman who truly puts his stamp on the film with a riveting performance as Bob Reynolds who once he becomes Sentry/Void, is more powerful than all of the avengers combined. Pullman becomes an intimidating presence and this might be his breakout role. In the end, we get a superhero blockbuster that dares to lurch into sobering material in a manner that never comes across as preachy or heavy-handed. It's a rare MCU film that carves out new territory and is worth watching. Gladly recommended."

          "content": "Thunderbolts stands out because it balances strong action with emotional weight. It is more than just another superhero film with flashy fights and a forgettable villain. The story dives deep into the emotional conflicts of its characters, and a lot of it feels surprisingly relatable. Unlike many films where backstories are just used to explain why someone turns evil, here the pain and trauma are part of the central story. It is not just about heroes stopping a big threat. It is about people trying to survive themselves.The film explores themes like mental health and challenges how we look at morality. It pushes back against the tired idea that anyone who suffers or struggles is dangerous or broken beyond repair. That kind of awareness is rare in big-budget action films.The directing is confident and thoughtful. The acting delivers on all levels, with performances that feel raw without going too far. The cinematography is stronger than expected for a superhero movie. It is dark, but that works here. It is gritty, but not in the overdone way that some darker comic films fall into. It feels grounded and intentional.Overall, Thunderbolts is a bold and refreshing entry in the genre. It reminds us that the best stories are not just about power, but about people."

          "content": "Thunderbolts marks a tonal shift from the high-concept chaos of the earlier MCU entries, especially those from what I'll call the OG MCU era. What sets it apart is its commitment to character-not just in terms of screen time, but emotional grounding. This is a story about people trying to hold themselves together, not gods trying to hold the universe together.Yelena Belova anchors the film effectively. Her grief over Natasha's death isn't just mentioned; it's woven into the DNA of the film, driving the mood and giving weight to the choices the characters make. The Red Guardian returns with pitch-perfect timing as both comic relief and emotional ballast, and the rest of the ensemble-particularly John Walker-adds complexity rather than noise.The film's antagonist, or more accurately its manipulated figurehead, adds a needed ambiguity. The real threat, Valentina de Fontaine, lurks in the margins, and it's becoming increasingly clear (at least to me) that she might be the true villain of Phase Five. Whether the MCU follows through on that remains to be seen, but the groundwork is solid.Some audiences might compare it unfavorably to Avengers: Endgame, but I think that's missing the point. This isn't trying to be a universe-defining crescendo. If anything, it's a corrective to the bombast. It's worth remembering how uneven the middle of the Avengers saga actually was-Age of Ultron through Infinity War included. Thunderbolts doesn't need to be a spectacle. It just needed to be good. And it is."

          "content": "Thunderbolts* is a solid Marvel film that ticks the usual boxes of superhero entertainment and spectacle, but has some admirable themes at heart.For me the strongest aspect is that it avoids being a generic good vs evil superhero story. It acknowledges the darkness inherent in most people and makes it the central obstacle the main characters need to overcome. I like that they are shown to be in a bad place emotionally, starting off quite dysfunctional and their dynamic develops as plot unfolds. The likes of Yelena, Bob, Jack Walker, and Valentina are used particularly well. Arguably you could say the are marginally too many involved, but this is the MCU so you come to expect it.What helps immeasurably are performances. Florence Pugh leads is fantastically and has great support from other cast members. The other standout for me is David Harbour who is mostly an outlet of comic relief, but switches effortlessly when scenes require more emotional clout.If you like Marvel action there is plenty of superheroes at battle to keep most fans satisfied. For me though most enjoyable spectacle is when abilities are used to save people from danger, rather than fight antagonists.It is a 7.5/10 for me but I round up."

          "content": "Is this the start of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's renaissance? Is it one of the best movies of the fifth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? My answer is yes. It's a great first step for Marvel Studios to get back on track with a solid story and no silly humor. The new approach makes the movie fun. That's how Marvel should act. There is no need to do too many experiments that make Marvel movies in this fifth phase drop.Thunderbolts* tells a story where the antisuperheroes consisting of Yelena Belova, Red Guardian, Ghost, John Walker and Taskmaster work together on an unexpected mission. They gathered after a secret mission given by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine. Valentina, who previously appeared as a cameo in several Marvel films and series, is now back with the story that Valentina has become a member of the CIA. Valentina herself is suspected of having hidden intentions with a secret project called Project Sentry at a laboratory in Southeast Asia called O. X. E. Bucky aka Winter Soldier is also back in this movie. Bucky is now one of the members of parliament who tries to investigate the activities of Valentina. In addition to these antisuperheroes, a man named Bob appears mysteriously.Thunderbolts* is one of the best movies from this fifth phase. Thunderbolts* has brought Marvel back to a better direction than the previous movie. Many of Marvel's experiments have made movies in other phases fail and feel bad. Thunderbolts* presents a simple and light story. Unlike previous Marvel movies that opened by telling the background of the characters, Thunderbolts* immediately stepped on the gas at the beginning with the conflict between Valentina and Parliament due to his involvement in Valentina's secret project. Of course, this requires viewers who have just seen Thunderbolts* to watch the previous Marvel movie. It is precisely the past conflicts of the anti-superheroes that become the storyline in this movie. Like the past of Yelena from childhood to adulthood and the mysterious character Bob who became the main conflict of the appearance of The Void itself. Thunderbolts* also has a touch of comedy that feels right and doesn't bring up a lot of silly humor even though there are some humor that feels flat. The storyline feels fast and without much ado at the beginning to the end of the movie which makes the audience not feel that this movie is almost 2 hours long. Wrapped with battle scenes that feel strong and give a mesmerizing impression. This is shown in the scene in the dome where Yelena, John Walker, Ghost and Taskmaster attack each other. Although the action is not too long, it still feels exciting and extraordinary. It was unfortunate to see Taskmater die in the battle that Valentina had arranged.Nevertheless, Thunderbolts* has an unusual story from previous Marvel movies. Thunderbolts* comes with a psychological theme and a sense of regret from each character in the past. The dark impression with a humanist approach makes this movie feel different. No longer featuring heroes who fail and lose and then experience resurrection, this time Thunderbolts* comes with the conditions of the characters who have to fight in the shadows of their past. However, even though this movie has been said to have a clear story direction, it is unfortunate that the resolution of the film's conflict is so anti-climactic. It does not present an epic battle action, but instead closes with dialogues containing advice and motivation. Sentry, as a villain who is predicted to be the strongest villain, must experience the decline of the character itself. Marvel again and always makes its villains feel bland at the end of the movie.Thunderbolts* is a good step from Marvel to get the hearts of their fans. It should be Marvel again to consider and analyze the concept of a film like this. Moreover, Thunderbolts* has confirmed that they are members of the New Avengers. Surely this is an interesting concern considering the dialog in the post credits scene which states that Sam Wilson does not agree with these members. And don't forget to stay tuned for the post credits scene that leaves you surprised. It will be a clue for the next movie and Marvel should do it by presenting a post credit scene that will continue in the next movie. Unlike previous movies that presented many new characters but did not have clarity for the next movie."

Like they are a bunch of misfits, repeated far too much BUT everyone is much more less - which was a great change. No one is pushing that weird comedic flair from the original series that really drags the pace of those. Also Thank god, they were also not as annoying as the original early 20s top Marvel stars (sans the on-or-off Russian Father character played by the Stranger Things Cop). Also, the unparalleled referential approach to story telling was put to the minimum.Actingwise, I personally did not care for anyone (including the much lauded Pugh) though I find it funny that Louis-Dreyfus was cast specifically because someone is definitely a huge fan of VEEP AND is literally written only as Selena Myers.BUT god, the last half- is like the worst of this period of Marvel. Nothing really dies in this films, everything is connected at some way. Then it regressed int the worst of these film: the cloying sentimentally, and the hoodwink referential attitude. Uggh. Also, they suddenly solved by doing the most corniest way. Like, the top honchos could not even like maybe take a minute and make a self contained well made film.Anyhow, since I am human who wants human connection - I still watched it full lol. Still not recommended.PS: If you watch any superhero nowadays, there is campy hilarity looking at those limbs during fight scenes - fighting sensible biology at hand lol."

Even Starlord at the beginning of the first Guardians of Galaxy and we share holding the hand of a loved one dying of cancer in a hospital bed in common. But back to Yelena and how I get her vibe so much, these quotes of hers below explain in such detail the downward spiral of a black hole that I myself went through following the loss of my sister. In my case, much like in the movie if it wasn't for some very good friends helping me see the value in myself. I might not have survived the path I was on. The image of her finding herself on the bathroom floor with a bottle was eerily reminiscent of how I saw myself. My friends literally and figuratively saved my life and somehow this quirky little MCU movie unexpectedly took my right back to that place. I saw myself back then in Yelena from the movie's opening line. I really couldn't believe how much this movie's message touched me as I watched it. I highly recommend Thunderbolts* to anyone who has previously found joy in the MCU because this movie truly is a return to form. But I will warn you, if you have lost a loved one and especially if you've lost a sister. This movie hits so hard so don't forget to bring some tissue. The Yelena quotes that hit me the hardest in no particular order: \"My God stop! If you cared you would have called!! I would've heard from you!!! I lost my sister again but Forever...and you disappeared!!!!\" \"There's something... wrong with me. An emptiness. I thought it started when my sister died, but now it feels like something bigger. Just a... void. Or maybe I'm just bored.\" \"I don't have anything anymore. All I do is sit, and look at my phone, and think of all the terrible things that I've done, and then I go to work, and then I drink, come home to no-one, and I sit and think about all the terrible things I've done again and again and I go crazy!\""

From the first lifeless scene to the painfully predictable finale, it feels like everyone involved was sleeping on the job and including the writers, the director, and possibly even the actors.The plot is a sleeping pill disguised as a blockbuster, recycling tired tropes with zero originality. The characters are cardboard cutouts, delivering cringe-worthy one-liners that land with the energy of a sleeping sloth.

          "content": "\"Thunderbolts (2025) isn't your typical Marvel rollercoaster - it's the twisted cousin who shows up at the party with scars, secrets, and sass.Directed with dark energy and surprising restraint, this film gives space to misfits like Yelena Belova, US Agent, and Bucky Barnes, while subtly questioning the morality of government-run superheroes.The action? Brutal. The humour? Sharper than Red Guardian's beard.Florence Pugh leads with charisma and emotional depth, and Wyatt Russell's performance as John Walker finally breaks out of the shadow of his Captain America past.Not every moment lands - the pacing dips midway, and Taskmaster still feels underwritten - but Thunderbolts earns its place as Marvel's anti-Avengers. A film that asks, \"What if the villains are just heroes with broken GPS?\"A risky, riveting chapter. Bring on the chaos.\""

          "content": "Just as Brave New World was trying too hard to be The Winter Soldier, this movie is trying too hard to be The Avengers. It's not always successful, but it is one of the better post-Endgame Marvel movies and shows that the troubled studio is making moves in the right direction.The biggest problem for the movie is the conflicting tones. There's the usual banter that has become a staple of Marvel movies since Guardians of the Galaxy, but without James Gunn it's hit or miss and too often gets in the way. It's that way here, the movie works best when it focuses on the dramatic. Exploring the character's traumatic backgrounds is by far the most interesting aspect. The themes of depression and regret work best. The fact that this is what factors into the primary threat and the conclusion, rather than just another CGI-heavy brawl, make this one of the better conclusions to a Marvel movie similar to X-Men: Days of Future Past and Ant-Man and the Wasp. It's refreshing and poignant to see a different kind of conclusion.The story is good, even if it's just a rehash of The Avengers. A disparate group of people brought together by a single threat end up saving the world. It worked in 2012 and to a lesser extent works now. One issue is that the movie places a lot of emphasis on Yelena. The Avengers managed its different personalities equally. Each got equal time and equal moments. This movie seems pretty focused on one. Yelena has most of the emotional beats and is the guiding force for most of the movie. She is well developed and Florence Pugh is the backbone of the film. John is well-developed and has the best moments outside of Yelena. Wyatt Russell had some great depth in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier that he brings back here. David Harbour's Red Guardian once again steals every moment he's in, showing that despite being the comic relief he can show a lot of depth and pathos. Bob is one of the best new additions to the franchise in a while. Ghost is just kind of there most of the movie. Taskmaster is completely wasted, almost as if Marvel gave in to the criticisms of Black Widow rather than trying anything to redeem the character to fans. There's rumors she originally had a different story that would have been pretty entertaining if they kept it. Winter Soldier is kind of an odd choice as he does so little that he's completely superfluous. It's almost like Marvel didn't know how to keep him involved and shoehorned him in.Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Valentina Allegra de Fontaine is the weakest part of the movie. She was introduced as a kind of dark version of Nick Fury, but she acts like her character from Veep. She's too cartoonish and silly. She propels the plot too often through her incompetence.There are also some pacing issues. The group escaping the Vault takes far too long. But once the movie is going it works. The four-way battle in the Vault, the desert highway chase, and the fight in the tower all work well.The movie mostly works on its own, it just suffers from the obvious comparisons to The Avengers. The ideas work, especially the themes of depression, trauma, and regret. There's probably a better cut of the movie with less jokes and more emphasis on what does work. Still, it shows that Marvel is at least trying to regain the quality that seemed lost after Endgame."

          "content": "I absolutely loved this film. One aspect I deeply appreciate about Marvel's recent direction is its growing commitment to addressing complex and important social issues-particularly mental health-through compelling visual storytelling. By integrating such themes into its narratives, Marvel not only creates awareness but also contributes to the normalisation of mental health discussions in popular culture. This film, in particular, exemplifies that effort beautifully.The character dynamics stood out to me as a strong element of the story. I was especially moved by the way the narrative conveyed that those who feel like outcasts or misfits are still worthy, still significant. It offered a powerful message of belonging and solidarity-that even if one feels out of place, there is always a path to connection and community. The theme of collaboration-of needing one another and finding strength in unity-was sensitively handled and emotionally resonant.A particularly striking and poignant element of the film was the portrayal of Bob. His experience, shaped by emotional trauma and mental health struggles, was rendered with remarkable depth. The depiction of the \"void\" as a metaphor for his internal state-his sense of isolation, misuse, and emotional disconnection-was visually and narratively powerful. I truly appreciated how the film not only represented this visually but also wove it into the dialogue, reinforcing the theme and ensuring its emotional impact was fully realised.Overall, I found this film both exhilarating and meaningful. Marvel has once again succeeded in combining entertainment with substance, and I was thoroughly moved by the care with which this story was told."

By shifting the stakes to a more grounded character-driven playing field Marvel breathes some much needed fresh air into their universe.One of the other immediate strengths this movie has is the allowance to let serious moments have the space to breathe without being undercut by jokes, (there are still humorous scenes, one fantastic sequence in particular comes to mind, but jokes don't pop up at inopportune moments). This is important because there are incredibly relatable challenges around mental health anchoring the central theme of the story.There is much to say but this isn't a spoiler review so one final, hopefully helpful, thought I have is this-Thunderbolts has some of the strongest character work for an MCU film in quite awhile. I cared about these characters and what happens to them and because of this I'm looking forward to seeing them again."

I also liked they where not explaning background story of every character their where small flash back of every character which was good. My favorite was wyatt Russell. I cannot say what i what i fell about sentry being nerfed i have a thoery here i think it was shown in the movie that sentry the power of 1000 exploding sun but in comics it was a million exploding sun so\nwhat i think will happen someone (probably dr doom or sentry himself ) will inject the serum again which will make sentry more powerfull but it will make him to forget his memory of thunderbolts after that he may become a ruler of a sector in battelworld."

The Story was well written and writers did a good job showing the scars behind the superheroes we love. This approach puts me in the same mind set as the struggles we see with Peter Parker in Spiderman 2 with a much deeper meaning dealing with actual trauma. This was overall the best movie marvel has released since End Game for me and I can't wait to see where they take this team of New Avengers in the future films. As a Sentry fan this film gets a 10/10 for me I love it 💯💯"

So, today when I entered the cinema my expectations were not so high. But throughout the movie I kept wondering when will the dull part begin!Instead, I got epic visuals, heartwarming human emotions, satisfying throwbacks for a long term MI fan. When the credit rolled I had nothing but respect for the makers, for the entire team, not just of this movie but for every movie since MI 1996.Overall, it might not top Mission Impossible Fallout but it will stay equally memorable to me. It did its job well which is to conclude the franchise in a spectacular way, without going over the top with action (think of Fast and Furious franchise).I surely liked it better than Dead Reckoning because there were more of likeable characters rather than annoying characters. It was like a bunch of good people coming together to fight a noble cause, something that was missing in the previous movie. Some people might find some of the scenes being too lengthy but I didn't mind all of the hard work being played a little longer than required. Watching Tom Cruise giving it his all was once again as thrilling as it was 25 (or so) years ago.As the movie said: our lives are the sum of our choices. Watching this movie was one of the best choice I ever made. So, if you are an MI fan don't miss this in cinema. It's going to be memorable, it's going to be epic!"

          "content": "Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning serves as the grandest and boldest farewell to arguably the greatest action franchise of all time. Yet, it lacks a true sense of finality.The film shoulders a colossal burden, attempting to deliver a worthy goodbye to Ethan Hunt and the iconic franchise. It aims to provide satisfying conclusions to a bloated roster of side characters while also setting up inevitable cash-grab sequels. Additionally, it strives to outdo every previous installment by going bigger and bolder than ever. While it excels in some areas, it falters in others.One of the film's biggest challenges is managing its vast ensemble of characters. The script occasionally struggles to balance them all, resulting in scenes where some characters randomly appear and disappear, seemingly out of convenience rather than logic. This inconsistency can be jarring, pulling the audience out of the experience.In typical Mission Impossible fashion, the film promises the most spectacular set pieces yet-and it delivers. These grand, meticulously crafted action sequences are thrilling to watch. However, their constant back-to-back presence somewhat dampens their impact. Once the audience becomes accustomed to the relentless spectacle, the element of surprise and tension starts to wane.The stunts, while still impressive, carry a bittersweet note. Unlike previous installments where Tom Cruise's daring feats were fully captured on camera, this time around, roughly half of the action scenes rely on noticeable green screen effects. Though understandable, given Cruise's age and safety precautions, it slightly detracts from the visceral thrill of witnessing genuine stunts, making the danger feel less real.Performance-wise, this installment shines, particularly with Angela Bassett delivering one of the most emotionally charged portrayals in the franchise. The script's emphasis on deeper emotions allows for some of the finest acting moments in the series.However, the editing feels somewhat sloppy, giving the impression that substantial material was left on the cutting room floor. While the brisk pacing keeps the film engaging, it sometimes feels as if we're only witnessing the start and end of scenes without the journey in between, leaving a sense of incompleteness. The cutting is fast, but not in an exhilarating manner-instead, it's disorienting.If this truly is the final goodbye to the Mission Impossible series, it's been an unforgettable ride. Despite its flaws, the franchise remains the pinnacle of action cinema in my book, and its legacy will undoubtedly endure for generations. I've said this before, and I'll say it again: we are witnessing a master at craft. Cherish it while you can.This message will self-destruct in five seconds."

Sorry, but that's just not good writing - it's exposition dumping.The rest is basically run-of-the-mill action sequences and plot devices that lead to a pretty predictable and not-very-exciting plot.

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning attempts to blend high-octane action with modern anxieties about artificial intelligence, but the result is a hollow, bloated film that mistakes noise for substance and spectacle for storytelling.At its core, this is a movie that doesn't understand the subject it tries to tackle. The portrayal of AI is laughably vague and rooted in outdated clichés-clearly written by someone whose grasp of modern technology is, at best, superficial. It reduces complex systems to buzzwords and omnipotent digital forces that defy any kind of internal logic. The film treats AI as both all-powerful and conveniently fallible, depending entirely on what the script demands at any given moment.The action sequences-once the defining strength of the franchise-have become formulaic. Tom Cruise runs. Tom Cruise clings to moving vehicles. Tom Cruise survives the impossible. These moments, once exhilarating, now feel obligatory. Each set piece is dragged out far too long, escalating beyond reason until tension gives way to fatigue. The repetition dulls their impact, and without meaningful stakes, it's hard to care. The inevitability of the heroes' survival robs every confrontation of suspense.Worse, the film seems uninterested in narrative coherence or emotional depth. Character development is non-existent, and most interactions feel like placeholders between the next explosion or high-speed maneuver. The plot, thin and implausible, serves only as scaffolding for increasingly improbable action. There's no real arc-just a steady drumbeat of louder, faster, and more until the credits roll.Ultimately, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a film trapped in its own delusions of grandeur. It clings to outdated storytelling methods, relying on spectacle to mask its lack of substance. It may satisfy those looking for three hours of escapism, but for anyone expecting a meaningful evolution of the franchise-or a competent exploration of contemporary themes-this movie offers little more than disappointment."

He's still being chased by all kinds of people. And he and his team are once again doing these insane, almost impossible missions that somehow push the limits every time. The rest of the team seemed to get more screen time this time, and there were a few cool scenes where it cut between them fighting in their own dangerous situations-those parts were especially intense and exciting.At the beginning of the film, there was a montage of clips from past Mission: Impossible movies, and it was so lit.At the end, there's no new mission for Ethan. Maybe this really is the end of a franchise that's lasted nearly thirty years.Tom Cruise is still killing it-both as an actor and doing all those crazy stunts. He moves like he's still in his early thirties. The fact that he does most of these dangerous scenes without a stunt double is seriously impressive and shows how dedicated he is.I watched the movie at 10 a.m. On the 17th, New Zealand time.

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is bombastic to put it mildly, given all the fast-paced exposition and visually resounding action setpieces.While after the Hitchcockian narrative of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, this concluding chapter somewhat may feel a bit inadequate - especially with all those lots of scenes in caves and lairs and prisons with no astoundingly risky turn - the highs are even higher than the lows seem lower. Let me tell you, everyone will be googling \"Mission Impossible 8 submarine scene\" a week for now.The underwater chapter is indeed breathtaking and quite original piece of filmmaking and a nice addition to M:I franchise which saves the movie big time. That 20-minute sequence with submarine is perhaps the most original piece of action written for action-oriented narratives since 1996's Mission: Impossible's own aqua cafe sequence between Ethan and Kittdridge, directed brilliantly by Brian De Palma. The suspense as Ethan so assiduously tackled all those aquatic, James Cameron-isque challanges was palpable. The realism and authenticity added the rest.Else, they have recycled tropes all over the place in order to pay homage - the gala which is rendered into a jail before the gathering itself is even exhibited - no fancy cars, garish costumes, stupendous decorum, dances, masks, bluetooth talk, etc. In here. I missed the trains as well.And narratively, there also exists this thing called predictability, and it's here to stay in the movie - the biggest weakness of The Final Reckoning. The movie is, perhaps, the least memorable for its twists - or the lack thereof - when compared to all the other M:I movies in the franchise, probably tied with Mission: Impossible 2. But that's not to say it is bad, or average or even above average - no! It's hella great!!In terms of action-based storytelling as well, this may seem like a step backwards from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Most scenes, when considering the movie is nearly 3 hours long, is quite limited or superfluous otherwise. But all of that pays off in the final act, trust Mr. Cruise. Because that brings us to the biplane chase sequence.After 150 minutes of absolutely no motorcycles and cars chasing each other, though plenty of Cruise sprinting, the red and yellow old-school biplanes going after each other in South African skies is something that should adequately feed all the ravenous audiences. It's suspenseful, it's engaging, it's REALLY dangerous; though the villainous Gabriel character is still bland and bad, like the previous entry.The diversity, without throwing into our faces what their genders are, is probably the quintessential example of how these things should be done. Hannah Waddingham in charge of aircraft carrier was something that really paid off. I didn't like the \"lady boy\" person wearing that vest and donning horrible hairstyle in that submarine. Angela Bassett seemed a natural as a president and didn't feel forced to assume a masculine aura just because she's a female US President. Thanks to all the brilliant women in the movie to forsake that awful cliché line \"you don't think a woman can do it\" - you show them subtly rather than preaching non-stop about such superfluous substance like in some Marvel movie.Overall, a decent enough Mission: Impossible movie but a brilliant actioner, nonetheless, given how the series has always fared when compared by Hollywood's standards. Kudos to Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie.7.5/10."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a bit of a disappointment, coming off the particularly high highs of Fallout and Dead Reckoning. The stakes are heightened narratively, with the end of the world being imminent throughout, but you don't often feel the desperation; you're mostly just told about it. And that's one of the things that holds this film back. It's so weighed down in exposition and dialogue scenes that aren't necessarily that much worse than such scenes in the other films in the series, but they're inferior enough that they start to drag. And there's not enough action here, which feels weird to say. There needed to be one more set piece, preferably during the first hour, because this is a long movie and the first hour or more is honestly a bit dull. The funny banter was also much less funny, when they even attempted humor. It's kind of a dour movie, which makes sense with the stakes, but also, I didn't really feel those stakes. So I would've rather just had that usual breezy team chemistry and joke-making.Speaking of stakes and showing things, I would've loved a set piece in a populated area? Or an action scene that felt more alive/crowded/in a place that felt real. In The Final Reckoning, there's an extended one with Cruise alone, one near the end (and on some of the posters for the film) involving some small planes, and then a handful of small shootouts and fist fights. There's nothing that's as big or as exciting as the whole train sequence in Dead Reckoning, and that film had some city action (plus a great car chase) and the whole airport scene. It's fresher in my mind than The Final Reckoning, even though I saw one two years ago and the other two hours ago. There's more tension and a feeling of danger when you can see civilization and bystanders, I think. And with everyone in the world being in danger because of the plot, it was weird to feel like no one (other than the main heroes and villains) was in danger during the action scenes.The finale of this movie is smaller scale, but that sequence is a knockout. It's almost worth the price of admission, but you do have to slog through some dreary stuff beforehand. The end of the world is nigh, but mostly you just hear about it, or some high-ranking government officials discuss things in board/bored rooms (and some of those scenes feel like if they were pushed into territory that was any more over-dramatic, we'd have Dr. Strangelove-esque comedy).The more I think about it, the more I realize this was kind of disappointing, even if I really loved the one big action scene that will, eventually, be the only thing I remember about this. I'm torn between like a 3/5 or a 3.5/5, and think I have to go more toward the former, just because this is too long for something with so little action. It needed to show more of the world, and we needed at least one sequence with more people and things in it. I feel like Dead Reckoning had about two or three times more great action than this, and the same can be said about Fallout. Dead Reckoning was a few minutes shorter, and Fallout was like half an hour shorter. Neither cost as much, but both felt more expensive. More bang for your buck watching those, and fewer bucks spent by the filmmakers to make them. The Final Reckoning feels pretty expensive, but not $300-400 million expensive.They got a little lazy with The Final Reckoning. They didn't get lazy in the couple of particularly flashy scenes, but they needed more big scenes and they shouldn't have had the film feel so empty. Too much telling, not enough showing. The lack of a consistent villain throughout hurt - Gabriel was a compelling presence in Dead Reckoning, but he's not in this one as much, disappearing for long stretches at a time.The Final Reckoning comes alive in parts. The plane stuff is thrilling. 90% of the movie, or maybe even a little more, fluctuates between being a tiny bit disappointing and very disappointing. I guess overall, I'm quite disappointed they couldn't keep the momentum going; these films had just kept getting better, from the second onwards, but no more.This really will be the Final one, I Reckon. Can't see it turning a profit, either."

          "content": "There are some actors who do not just play a role. They live it. They breathe it. They are it. And Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is exactly that. Watching The Final Reckoning feels like sitting in a dark room filled with decades of memories, missions, betrayals, and near-death experiences and quietly realizing it might be the last time we see this man sprint toward danger for our entertainment. If this really is the end, then what a journey it has been.This film is not just about espionage, global threats, or saving the world. At its very core, it is a cinematic love letter to Tom Cruise. From the very first shot, the camera practically worships him. And honestly, we do too. He is Mission: Impossible. It's almost as if the film pauses just long enough to let us appreciate the legacy he's built. The real bruises, the real fear in his eyes, the real wind slamming against his face thousands of feet in the air. When they say he does his own stunts, this movie is the ultimate proof of that.There's one sequence, a 20-minute spectacle involving planes, that had us gripping the edge of our seats. Not because it was over-the-top, but because it felt so damn real. The positioning of the cameras, the roaring sound of the engines, the barely visible tremble in Ethan's muscles. All of it screams authenticity. You could feel the gravity. You could feel the weight. And you could tell Cruise was putting every drop of himself into it. It is art through adrenaline.But The Final Reckoning is not perfect. And maybe it was never meant to be.This installment chooses not to waste time diving into backstories or emotional flashbacks. It is mission first, emotions later. And while that does keep the pace laser-focused for the most part, it also comes with a cost. Some fans may feel like the heart, the soul, the \"why should I care?\" moments, are few and far between. At times, it feels like the movie is sprinting only toward its mission goal that it forgets everything else.What we admire, though, is how The Final Reckoning ties itself beautifully to the past. It is not trying to create a brand new mission. It is not throwing a bunch of new characters into the mix. It is solving what Dead Reckoning left behind, and in doing so, it loops itself tightly around the other past six films. It closes loops. It answers questions. It brings emotional closure to threads that have been hanging for years. There's a certain bravery in doing that, of focusing on one mission and choosing not to open new doors just for the sake of future films.And then there's the villain. This antagonist is not just a bad guy, he is intangible. He is near God-like. The stakes are sky-high. It genuinely feels impossible. Like, actually impossible. It puts Ethan and his team in a corner where every second counts. Time is running out. Stake is at all-time high. It is everything we want in a Mission: Impossible film. It dares to make us believe the heroes may not win this time. That someone might not make it out alive.Here's where the main issue lies; this final installment felt very long-winded. It feels like it wants to tell you everything. It seems like it takes itself seriously... way too seriously even. It really does feel like it makes itself looks complex much more than what it is and what it's supposed to be.Some scenes also stretched out very long, like they wanted audience to listen to every word or watch at every action that took place. The pacing is very slow. One scene can go up to 7-8 minutes of what could have been cut to just about 3-4 minutes. It wants it to be very detailed but here's the thing. It's dour. It can be a bit dull. And because of that, some audience may lost interest in the movie. It gives you a lot of expositions that can feel too much for some especially if you're not that invested with the franchise or if you've forgotten a lot of details from the previous movies.There is also an underwater sequence teased in the trailers that promises something epic. And visually, it delivers. But emotionally and logically? It breaks the very rules this franchise has set up for years. This is the first time it felt like the story needed Cruise to have a bit of CGI help. A bit of plot armor. And that hurts. Because we know he is capable of doing the impossible. But here, it feels like the movie cheated its way to impress the audience. And that matters to us.And yes, the tone itself is gritty. It wants to be raw. It wants to be as realistic as it can. It wants the audience to immerse itself with Ethan Hunt to complete this final mission. Some may get into it. Some others may just feel tedious waiting for the next scene to happen. But here's one thing they forget; with all the grittiness that lies, it forgets to be entertaining for the mass market. The entertainment value in this is lacking for general audience. Everything that's entertaining with Fallout was almost devoid here. What made Fallout great was even with all the grittiness and the grainy tone, its entertainment value is top notch and high octane. It knows its target audience, it has the right balance of action, comedy, drama and romance. But The Final Reckoning forgets that part. Just serious faces doing serious things for almost 3 hours. The film forgets how to have fun. It forgets that people come to be thrilled and entertained. And that lack of balance makes the ride feel a little heavier than it should be.And finally, the ending. Is it satisfying? In some ways, yes. It gives us closure. It gives us enough to walk away with peace. But is it great? That's debatable. It could have used more 'heart'. It could have reached deeper. It ends with the feeling that maybe, just maybe, we're not actually done. That there might be more in the vault. And in today's Hollywood with reboots and sequels era, that's not hard to believe.Verdict: This one takes itself seriously. Way too seriously. It drowns in exposition, stretches scenes beyond their breaking point, and forgets that people came here to feel alive, not just overwhelmed. It forgets to breathe. It forgets to have fun. But maybe that's the point. The Final Reckoning is a heavy, brooding farewell that wants to honor Ethan Hunt and Tom Cruise with the gravitas of a cinematic eulogy. Because this feels like the last time we'll see him this raw, this real. His 20-minute plane sequence alone is worth the ticket. If this really is the end, The Final Reckoning isn't flawless but it is fearless. Thank you, Tom Cruise."

However, not all are to my liking - the twist wasn't as impressive as previous movies and the plot felt a bit linear and thin. It's almost 3 hours so I feels like a road trip rather than a roller coaster. Despite this, I enjoyed the ride and it reminded me of what MI is really about: \"We live and die in the shadows, for those we hold close, and those we never meet.\""

Continuing Cruise and McQuarrie's intrepid crusade against the rising use of AI, it's hard not to enjoy the duo at home in their element, delivering yet more jaw-dropping stunts and globe-trotting adventure, overflowing with overly complex plot and escalating complication upon complication. In many ways, this is less an action film and more a disaster flick. Where worst-case scenarios were once implied, they are now visualised with apocalyptic projections. Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Recokoning completely embraces its grandiose nonsense. It acknowledges itself as huge, fun, silly, and emotionally rewarding, never attempting to restrain its exuberance, and we love it for that. A sentimental sendoff that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible. Ethan can rest easy now. Mission accomplished Tom."

When I read the negative reviews from critics, it made me wonder whether the last installment in the Mission Impossible series was really going to be a letdown.But they could not have been more wrong.I have been a fan of the series from the beginning and have been looking forward to this finale. I'd admit that Dead Reckoning didn't do it for me on the first watch, but I learned to appreciate it after watching two or three more times. I was, of course, looking forward to The Final Reckoning. Like any normal fan would.The actions, the acting, the stunts, were obviously amazing. Tom Cruise had made sure to never lack in that department in this series. Almost every action scene in this movie had me at the edge of my seat; my heart pumping with adrenaline. It's one of the many qualities of this series--it keeps you on the edge and glued to your seat, anxious for what's coming next.But what really got to me the most was how the movie had a heart. It wasn't all about the boom-boom pow, or the fancy gadgets, or even their signature mask disguises. It was about the characters and how their stories were ending.I didn't really focus much on the story, to be honest. The whole \"fate of the world\" and \"end of the world as we know it\" had been used so many times. It's definitely not new. But I honestly don't think that was the main point of the movie. It wanted to have a heart and it didn't fail to deliver that. There were moments where I was near to tears just because of the nostalgia it gave. As a fan, I couldn't really ask for more. I loved these characters. Seeing their final hurrah really just tugged my heart in all the right ways.I don't understand how some people didn't like it. It was a 10/10 in every aspect. Maybe even more. It was more than a movie. It was an ode to the fans, a goodbye letter to those who had loved and stayed from the very start. And it did this so perfectly that I was moved to tears in the end.I will say this again: DO NOT listen to the critics or the negative reviews. If you are a true fan like me, this movie would be everything you've ever hoped for it to be."

Also, one new character, which was never featured before in a Mission Impossible movie, proves they were banking on a different outcome in the last U.

Meanwhile, positions of authority are consistently filled by flawless, strong, independent women or members of minority groups. One such character-whose sole narrative purpose is to be tough, competent, and operate in a \"male-dominated\" field-ends up saving Ethan, of course, in a moment meant to prove her superiority.This kind of subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) messaging really soured the experience for me, which is a shame given the otherwise excellent action and lead performance."

It balances adrenaline-pumping action with heartfelt character moments. Every frame feels deliberate, every line of dialogue purposeful. The tension is relentless, yet never overwhelming - the pacing allows the story to breathe and gives weight to the emotional stakes.Tom Cruise, as always, is simply phenomenal. He doesn't just perform stunts - he lives the role of Ethan Hunt. But this time, it's different. There's a maturity in his performance, a deep emotional undercurrent that adds richness to every decision Hunt makes. You can feel the burden of years of sacrifice, the toll of being the one who always chooses the mission, the people, and the world over himself. It's not just about saving the day anymore - it's about legacy, love, and closure.The supporting cast also brings their A-game. The camaraderie, loyalty, and silent pain shared between the team add layers to the story. And the villain - without spoiling anything - is formidable, intelligent, and deeply symbolic of everything Ethan has been fighting against all these years.Visually, the movie is stunning. From jaw-dropping action sequences that defy belief (yes, Tom did that again!) to quiet, intimate moments that hit you right in the chest, the direction is nothing short of genius. The cinematography and score elevate the experience, blending nostalgia with innovation.There were scenes where I held my breath. Moments that brought tears to my eyes - not just from the stakes, but from the emotional resonance of seeing this chapter close. It's rare that an action franchise can also tug at your heartstrings, but The Final Reckoning does exactly that.This isn't just a farewell to a character. It's a farewell to an era. A cinematic triumph that reminds us why we fell in love with Ethan Hunt in the first place - his relentless spirit, his loyalty, and his heart.If you've grown up with Mission: Impossible, this finale will feel like saying goodbye to an old friend. And if you're watching for the first time - well, you're in for something truly unforgettable."

Unfortunately everything around these set pieces is mediocre. The characters are bland, the movie seriously lacks powerful characters both on antagonist and protagonist team. The loss of Ilsa, under utilization of Benji and Luther and lackluster villain make the movie boring outside the set pieces. The mission stakes are too grandiose and convoluted for maximum impact.This film has lots of \"melodrama\", which is just is gruesomely boring, or tacky or manufactured by too much thought. On top of this melodrama there is way too much fan service by means of montage, callbacks, character introductions and so on. Also after Ilsa, the overarching love/care act for Grace feels manufactured, out of character somewhat, and lacks depth.Weirdly the most expensive and longest entry has the appearance of having less action than other entries.(not sure if calculating exact minutes) Here I am counting as action also heists and other \"plotting scenes\", because even though not strictly action, they carry movie forwards in similar fashion.Unfortunately this movie is disappointing and falls behind Part 1 and most of the entries, maybe being on par with MI 1, as it also suffers from hugely and is carried by two set pieces."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Last Reckoning marks the end of an era, offering a thrilling yet reflective conclusion to one of cinema's most enduring action franchises. While it may not surpass the franchise's high-water marks-such as 'Fallout' or 'Ghost Protocol'-it still delivers a gripping, emotionally charged experience that honors Ethan Hunt's journey and the team that stood beside him.Tom Cruise once again commits wholeheartedly to the role, performing daring stunts with the same intensity we've come to expect. But beneath the explosive set pieces lies a deeper, more introspective tone. Hunt is no longer just the indestructible spy-he's a man reckoning with the consequences of decades spent on the edge, chasing justice in a world that rarely plays fair.Director Christopher McQuarrie blends heart and spectacle with skill, even if the narrative occasionally gets bogged down by overstuffed plotting and a few familiar tropes. The villain, while serviceable, doesn't quite reach the heights of previous antagonists, and some supporting characters deserved more development. That said, the film's pacing remains tight, and the action sequences are as sharp and kinetic as ever.What 'The Last Reckoning' does best is bring emotional closure. There's a sense of finality in its quieter moments-a farewell that respects the audience's investment over nearly three decades. It may not be the most dazzling entry in the 'Mission: Impossible' canon, but it's an earnest, high-stakes conclusion that stays true to its core: loyalty, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of doing what's right.In the end, it's a satisfying send-off. 'Mission: Impossible - The Last Reckoning' may not be the series' finest hour, but it's a worthy and engaging finale to the Ethan Hunt legacy."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Final Chapter) is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most iconic action franchises of our time. As someone who has followed the Mission: Impossible series over the years, I can confidently say this final installment exceeded my expectations and delivered an unforgettable cinematic experience.From the very beginning, the film grabs your attention with a high-stakes opening sequence that sets the tone for the rest of the story. The pacing is tight, the stakes are higher than ever, and the plot manages to be both complex and easy to follow. The writers have done an excellent job of weaving together elements from previous films, giving longtime fans a sense of closure while also keeping things fresh and exciting.Tom Cruise, once again, proves why he's one of the most committed action stars in Hollywood. His portrayal of Ethan Hunt is as intense and emotionally grounded as ever. You can really feel the weight of his choices and the sacrifices he's made over the course of the series. Cruise's stunt work continues to impress-there are scenes that had the entire audience holding their breath. Whether it's the daring motorcycle leap off a cliff or the tense hand-to-hand combat on a speeding train, every action sequence is crafted with precision and realism.The supporting cast also shines. Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and newcomers like Hayley Atwell bring depth and chemistry to the team. Their interactions add heart and humor to the film, balancing out the intense action. The villain is also well-developed, with a motive that feels timely and relevant, tying in themes of technology, power, and control.Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography captures breathtaking locations-from the deserts to snowy mountains to densely populated cities-and uses them to elevate the tension and visual storytelling. The practical effects and minimal use of CGI make the action feel real and grounded, which has become a trademark of the franchise. The soundtrack is another highlight, adding energy and emotion without ever overpowering the scenes.One of the things I appreciated most about Dead Reckoning - Final Chapter is how it respects the audience's intelligence. The plot isn't dumbed down, and the emotional arcs are given time to breathe. This isn't just a movie about explosions and car chases (though there are plenty of those); it's also about trust, loyalty, and the personal cost of doing the right thing.There are moments of genuine suspense, where the outcome is uncertain, and character decisions carry real weight. The emotional beats land effectively, especially as the film reflects on the journey Ethan Hunt and his team have taken over the years. Fans will appreciate the callbacks and subtle nods to earlier films.While the movie is packed with action, it never feels bloated or overlong. Each scene serves a purpose, building toward a powerful and satisfying conclusion. It wraps up storylines in a way that feels earned, without relying on cheap tricks or fan service. By the end, I felt a mix of excitement, satisfaction, and a bit of sadness knowing this is the final chapter.In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Final Chapter) is a must-watch for action movie fans and anyone who has followed the franchise. It delivers thrilling action, strong performances, emotional depth, and a fitting end to Ethan Hunt's epic journey. My overall experience was very good, and I left the theater thoroughly entertained and impressed. It's a true testament to what blockbuster filmmaking can achieve when handled with care and passion."

Did Tom Cruise trick you with his eyes and smoldering look? Let's see if the modern audience shows up to support billionaire Tom Cruise, whose butt we get to see multiple times during the movie.There's a lot of homework to follow the plot, so I suggest you watch the whole franchise as homework.As an action movie fan, it was a long 3 hours to endure, for just 5 min of epic action.

Like the old generation X crowd-pleaser \"An engaging story\" the Elvis cover \"A little less conversation\" and the hard-hitting \"Memorable villains\".Compare old guests like Jon Voight from the first album and Seymour Duncan Hoffmann from the third one with Esai Morales who has joined the latest tour and hardly can carry a tune. Pom Klementieffs was a nice positive spark, though. She can both dance and growl!For me - 'The Final' sadly felt too much like one long jam session. At least the setlist ended on high note, but the epic swansong I was hoping for? No!"

I've seen a few early reviews criticising the silly plot and the overexaggerated stakes. Granted, both things are pretty over the top, but that's exactly what we've come to expect from this franchise.Between climbing the tallest building in the world, clinging to the side of an airplane, beating up Henry Cavill while free solo climbing, jumping a motorbike off a cliff and landing on a moving train, and now to all the things in this movie, this series has never been anything but silly and overexaggerated. And that's exactly why this movie works.This film boasts probably the best stunts ever put to camera. You may credit that to the insane budget or the strings Tom Cruise is able to pull... I credit it to the guts of steel of the leading man. This film is an absolute adrenaline rush making 3 hours fly by, and pulling together the last 30 years of this insane franchise. It was an absolute blast!Cannot reccomend it enough!"

This movie has everything, convincing story, hand combats, car chases, plane chases, underwater sequences with eerie bgm that will even satisfy horror movie fans. Tom Cruise excels his previous movies and brings audience to the edge of the seat while performing death defying stunts. But they could have worked on the screenplay to showcase how Entity is disrupting plans and getting smarter, both Gabriel and entity are silent villains and show up only later. Do watch it in theatres if you like Action movies or if you are a fan of MI series and Tom. BUT mind you this is a very serious movie, feels like the world is about to end not the usual jokes with benji like other MI movies. Although I think this couldnt be the last movie in series as it doesn't feel like one and Mission Impossible as a series needs a much well written farewell."

          "content": "'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' is the 8th and possibly final film in the franchise. Pretty impressive that Tom Cruise has been steadily making these for 30 years, without over-saturating the market. This is a direct sequel to 'Dead Reckoning', with Ethan (Cruise) in possession of the key to stop the malevolent AI called \"The Entity\". This means he comes out of the shadows a bit, and interacts with the US President (Bassett) and General Sidney (Offerman).The plot means Ethan has to retrieve something from a sunken submarine, which is arguably the tensest scene in the film, as well as possibly the most unbelievable, but is expertly done. We also get to see the team from the previous film back - long-timers Luther (Rhames), Benji (Pegg), Kittridge (Czerny), plus returnees Grace (Atwell), Paris (Klementieff) and antagonist Gabriel (Morales). The best call-back though is Donloe (Saxon) and how he's important to the story. As much as it's all about Ethan, it's always good to see the IMF team in action.Similar to the last film, it's shot around the world - London, Norway, South Africa. The stunts in the bi-planes flying over the South African coast are particularly stunning, and amazing to know that Cruise is literally hanging on those planes himself. While perhaps not as cohesive as 'Fallout' or 'Dead Reckoning', at 2 hours 45min there's plenty of action to get through. Less espionage, and more \"convince the armed forces not to blow each other up\", making sure the stakes are high. Less trademark-Tom-running than usual, but plenty of fight scenes, bomb diffusions and stunts galore."

Missing that this time should've given the clue that this is supposed to be more like the first three than what we've been getting recently.All these movies worked in a different plane than ours, but never really felt like a true sci-fi, but this time it felt like they were almost ready to embrace it as dystopian, that too, a plain generic one, which doesn't exactly work in my opinion.It has a couple of well-made set pieces, but doesn't fill the movie with them. The amount of exposition and retcons in this movie is unbelievable, especially the first hour is tedious.The chemistry between Grace and Ethan in Dead Reckoning was perfect, but here it felt forced, which was so unnecessary.Before this, whenever Mission: Impossible knew that the plot was becoming too generic, they cleverly infused the movie with set pieces that perfectly complement the plot, but here, even the design of the set pieces is generic and too few, far and in between. There's so much focus on the lame, plot-hole-filled generic plot that it was hard to believe it's a Mission: Impossible movie.But even with all those issues I had with the writing and design of it, the making is still top-notch. The cast is strong, and it is shot impeccably. They were trying to go for heavy call backs and nostalgia, giving weight to the plot, and even though it's not fully successful, it works to some level. And even when the action scenes aren't as innovative as this franchise is known for, they are much better executed than most others who try this.So, even with all my problems, I did enjoy it, it's okay, but my experience can only be described as underwhelming."

Does Ethan embark on his ultimate mission against the entity? And how does he take it on?Tom Cruise once again proves why he's the ultimate action star, dazzling audiences with his incredible stunts and signature style. Christopher McQuarrie and Eric Jendresen deliver an exhilarating screenplay, packed with fast-paced sequences, intricate intercuts, and relentless twists. The emotional depth in certain moments adds a strong connection, while each character is crafted with purpose, playing key roles that enhance the gripping narrative.Technically, the film is a masterpiece-jaw-dropping action sequences, edge-of-the-seat thrills, and breathtaking visuals make for an unforgettable cinematic experience. The music elevates every moment, ensuring maximum impact. That flight chase and submarine sequence alone are worth the ticket price! A standing ovation to the entire team. Without a doubt, this film has the potential to break records at the worldwide box office.For the best experience, I highly recommend watching all *Mission Impossible* films. And if you haven't seen *Dead Reckoning Part 1* yet, be sure to watch it before diving into *Final Reckoning*!"

This franchise has pushed the boundaries of action sequences and introduced the cinema lovers to some exotic locations. While doing all this over a period of almost 30 years and 8 films there has been one constant force driving the franchise which is Tom Cruise as the iconic character Ethan Hunt. With the final piece of the puzzle, Mission: Impossible The Final Reckoning, Ethan Hunt continues on his mission from the previous movie The Dead Reckoning with some unique challenges this time around.As the previous part ended in an almost cliffhanger this film continues the journey of Ethan Hunt and his team continue to fight against two antagonists with one being the AI known as Entity. The movie starts with a bit of a time gap from where it ended previously to show the negative impact that Entity has had over the world and also sets up the new arc for some characters. Ethan continues his pursuit of the antagonist Gabriel who has been playing games with Ethan and team from the previous part while the governments try to get ahold of the Entity in their own ways. Ethan unlocks one puzzle after another to find ways to stop Entity from taking over the world and also ensure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands of Gabriel. The intense screenplay doesn't really leave too much time for the audience to think and analyze. It comes as no surprise that the movie has its fair share of emotional scenes and also some fun nostalgic moments. It'd be better to recap your knowledge of the previous movies before watching this movie to have a great experience. The movie does lack a strong antagonist over the two parts and the ending almost seems very similar to some other parts as well. The movie also leaves a part of the past unexplored which kept teasing the audience over two parts.This time the adventure takes us through some incredible underwater and up in the air stunt sequences. The movie turns into a very intense immersive experience when it shifts to the IMAX ratio for some key sequences. This movie probably has the least man to man combat scenes compared to the previous parts. That doesn't take away anything from the adrenaline rush as there are many adventurous scenes. The technical departments of the movie continue to operate at the highest level.At this point of time, my words can barely do any justice in describing how good Tom Cruise is. The whole world knows and everyone is in awe. Compared to the previous movies, Simon Pegg doesn't really have a whole lot of quirky moments but is still very impactful. Ving Rhames completes his journey in the series with a strong goodbye. Hayley Atwell's character turns slightly serious in this part and most times only ends up being a spectator. I could say that Pom Klementieff's character is one of the most well written characters of this franchise. Angela Bassett, Nick Offerman and Holt McCallany shine in their limited screen presence. I cannot reveal much about some other key characters which are written and played well as it could be a spoiler. Esai Morales' role in this film is not as intense as it was in The Dead Reckoning and the mystery+intent around the character could have been better.Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a very well thought out conclusion for a hallmark franchise."

We know how it works: if the movie earns enough money, they keep shooting, so I'd expect on some spin-off or another part in which Ethan Hunt will be saving the whole universe;). Who knows - maybe this is really the last chapter, or maybe the creators are planning to squeeze something out of the tired and, let's face it, quite old Tom Cruise.Okay, but how is it really? Is the supposed final chapter is a worthy ending to the series, or quite the opposite? I will talk about it from my perspective, as a person who saw only the previous part and \"Fallout\".Christopher McQuarrie is responsible for directing, and he and Erik Jendresen are responsible for the script. The plot is a direct continuation of \"Mission: Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One\". IMF team members along with agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) continue their search for Entity - the artificial intelligence that has infiltrated the intelligence network around the world.The goal of this AI is the annihilation of humanity, and the key slogan is \"Sevastopol\". Gabriel (Esai Morales) - a follower and executor of Entity's will, who wants to create a \"new and better world\" is stampling on the heels of the main characters. To prevent a global disaster, the heroes must obtain the source key, located on the wreck of a Russian submarine. They have 72 hours to do it and if they succeed, the world will be saved. If not - game over.I'll start with the fact that the first half of the film was, unfortunately, tragic. Two years have passed since the previous part, so it was appropriate to make a meaningful summary. The creators decided on a few-minute editing of the summary, which is a chaotic conglomeration of scenes. Cut after cut, it's hard to understand who is who, who is on which side and what it's actually about. Total mess of editing and scripting. Unfortunately, this impression accompanied me for most of the film.When the \"action\" finally began to start, the film began to slow down... The pace slowed down, became monotonous and, frankly, boring. There was perhaps one moment when I felt tension, the scene where Ethan goes deep under the water to search the wreckage where the key to victory is located. The scene was realized quite well and have made some emotions. There was another scene that delighted me, more with the performance than the tension itself. It's the scene with the plane (it's not a spoiler, because you can see this sequence in the trailer), where Tom Cruise again shows his stunt skills, and it looks impressive, but narratively it's a bit of \"wrapping\": Ethan falls, he's on the plane again, he falls again, and so on...As for the action - there is a lot of it. But when it comes to the plot... don't expect fireworks... A lot of running, shooting and explosions, but the story is quite boring.To sum up: \"Final Reckoning\" is certainly a beautiful laurel for fans of action cinema and fans of the series. We have everything we know from the previous parts, but unfortunately, often in a weaker version. If you love this series - it's worth watching - either at home or in the cinema. If you are indifferent, it is better to wait until it hits streaming platforms. And if you decide not to watch this movie, you won't lose anything."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible The Final Reckoning isn't the best of the series (that's Rogue Nation/Fallout), but it's a fun time at the theatre, even though a number of factors might dissuade some from accepting this mission.Partly a trip down memory lane, the film directly references events from previous films, but audiences need not have seen them to understand. One flashback in particular is simply brilliant in its reveal, answering a question that's bothered me for years. There's surprises at every turn, some of which were genuinely jaw-dropping.And then there are the stunts, which I think one-up the BK and plane sequences from the previous films. Cruise is simply nuts, but it all makes for fantastic action, especially on a real IMAX screen. While there's a lot to love here, there are a few things that frankly are hard to figure out. The usually precocious Atwell is sidelined here, relegated to that of an Ilsa Faust. And speaking of, M:I8 sorely misses her. It wasn't the burgeoning relationship with Hunt that we miss, it's the grey she projected and how that impacted Hunt. Instead, we get a lot (too much?) of Cruise here, separated from his team, and one feels that vacuum. When they all do hook up, it's great. Even though The Entity is somewhat sidelined, it's still a menacing creature, ready to end the world in nuclear fire. Gabriel, seemingly The Entity's alter-ego, is good but not great, as is Paris whom I was hoping would become the team's version of John Wick. Not so here, but perhaps with future installments we might get lucky.M:I8 is another win for Cruise/McQ, even though it overtly misses the deeper connections to MI:7. When it succeeds, it absolutely triumphs, delivering action sequences that could be the best of the series. Don't be scared by the runtime as it paced really well. Go see this in IMAX as I did, but don't partake in too many concessions. You're bound to miss something if nature calls."

A good cinematic experience but disappointed in context to story telling. Some of story crafting look convenient and does not focus on contemporary narrative. The recap for me look too long. Although it seems lengthy so that people who does not watch previous movies can understand it. I still think the first half can be made shorter and some part of action can be made more compelling in making story more compelling."

A zapping movie indeed, worth a watch.It follows Hunt in his quest to end the virus called \"The Entity\". The stunts of the movie are also very good and expected from the Mission Impossible series. The movie definitely hasn't underachieved. The one under the submarine was also pristine. What the movie lacks from is a fast pacing and also a pretty underwhelming ending scene.

          "content": "Mission: Impossible has long been the benchmark for what action cinema should be-a bar set so high that no other franchise has quite reached it. That being said, the latest and final installment of the franchise falls flat compared to its preceding films such as Fallout and Dead Reckoning. However, keeping in mind that these movies set such a high standard, and judging the film subjectively, it still stands as an amazing action thriller.The film's worst and best moments are split between its two halves. The first half starts with noticeable hiccups: poor editing, awkward flashback sequences, and excessive exposition from previous installments. This drags down the experience and pulls you away from the traditional Mission: Impossible excitement. While the first half does contain some tense moments and impactful dialogue, it overall feels dragged out and could have been summarized in 30 minutes. However, once Ethan Hunt begins his search for the Sevastopol, the film starts shifting gears, and you finally begin to feel the experience you came for is just around the corner.The second half corrects nearly everything the first half does wrong. It contains the majority of the film's action and moves away from excessive backstory exposition. While the action sequences are far less frequent compared to previous installments, the film makes you wait for them in a way that builds tension. When the action does arrive, it's so worth the wait. It begins with the underwater submarine sequence, and from that moment on, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end credits. The set pieces are visually mesmerizing, enhanced by brilliant sound design-especially during the entire submarine sequence.Every character delivers a strong performance, with Tom Cruise once again leading the pack. No character feels like deadweight; each plays a vital role in moving the story toward its conclusion. In the end, despite its flaws, this is a must-watch film and a remarkable experience-an emotional farewell to one of the most iconic action franchises in cinema history."

This film picks right after Dead Reckoning and go straight into the plot without wasting time and what happens for next 3 hours is filled with action, adventure, some of the craziest stunts pulled off by Tom Cruise with some emotional moments which raised the stakes of the story but when movie ends it leaves you desire for more because something felt missing which made last few films great. I don't know either it was faulty screenplay or lack of good story or even lack of many dramatic moments which took away the soul of this movie.. I can't say further without spoiling some story but you'll get that when you see that.. now talking about technical aspects i loved the practical effects and some crazy stunts especially that underwater submarine sequence which is one of the best underwater sequence I've ever seen in any hollywood movie, it was intense and jaw dropping.. the second one is climax taking place on some old style plane and that was adrenaline pumping epic moment of this movie, I was edge of my seat the whole time but still Fallout had a better helicopter sequence than this and maybe it looked good on paper but climax on plane is not much thrilling as it was in last movie which took place on a crashing train.. I disliked the decisions they made in regards to some particular characters but still it was great to see those moments.. now talking about action and fight scenes, this movie surprisingly lacked too much action and long fight scenes but only in comparison to the previous part but since this was said to be the last film in franchise i expected them to go into all on action territory but it doesn't sacrifice the intense storytelling in exchange of cheap thrills action scenes (Fast and Furious lol) overall there are many fight scenes which I enjoyed even though I expected more.. Anyways The Final Reckoning is a good MI film but I hope Tom Cruise and Paramount decide to make another one because fans deserve better finale than this this because it has a sense of finality but still I believe more stories can be told with a proper ending next time.. This film is a must watch for the fans of this franchise, action adventure lovers and most importantly Tom Cruise...Mission Impossible The Final Reckoning is released today in many international countries and for USA and rest of the world in opens next week don't miss this out and watch it in IMAX for witnessing jaw dropping stunts and hearing Dolby Atmos sound effects which will enhance your experience..."

It forces its themes on you, the side characters are nothing more than that and the plot itself is much simpler and weaker than any other Mission: Impossible film. But goddamn, this film is good at what it does well.Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt is fantastic. His acting is brilliant, the character writing is the deepest it has ever been and the culmination of his traits and ideals is easily comparable to what the MCU achieved with RDJ as Iron Man. Bringing back plot points and characters from previous films was an absolutely genius stroke. And even though it feels retconned to hell, it just...works. Everything about it just works as well as it possibly could.The direction is what we've come to expect from McQuarrie at this point. Well-done and gets the point across. But the cinematography and action direction this time around takes the cake so hard. The entire underwater sequence, which Cruise rightfully hyped up beforehand, is almost unforgettable. Naturally increasing, realistic stakes, ethereal wide shots, some of the best set pieces of the franchise yet. And more than anything else, seamlessly connecting into the plot and themes in an almost criminally perfect manner. Can't wait to rewatch it over and over again.And finally, the music. It isn't standout. It isn't doing anything innovate or new. But just like the rest of the film, it has perfected itself at the cost of becoming cliche. The music might not blow your mind away like certain scores, but certainly elevates a scene to incredible heights because of how well it is handled and edited in.In the end, The Final Reckoning will probably invite a lot of discussion. It is certainly not a perfect film, but in my opinion, it does exactly what it sets out to do. And it does it with style. It is as good as you want it to be."

The eighth film doesn't follow it's previous films as the initial scenes are dedicated to evoke the nostalgia. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt once again shines and stuns the viewers with the stunts. Though his efforts are laudable, the screenplay is rather a mixed bag with uneven pacing, especially with the drama. The whole submarine segment paid off while the lengthy biplane scene is made worthy by Tom Cruise. These scenes on IMAX screen was worth the theater visit. However, the film's tone is very serious and gives very little room for the franchise's signature humor. As pointed out earlier, it started out as a swan song and later they changed their mind, this heavily shows in the screenplay. Overall, it's a decent watch thanks to two solid segments."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is the victory lap follow-up not only to the setup of its immediate predecessor, but also as the final instalment of the franchise. And it succeeds on its sincere, and sometimes sombre, deliverance of its callbacks, pay-offs, and send-offs.Tom Cruise delivers one of the more emotional turns as Ethan Hunt out of all the performances he's given in each instalment, this time moreso conveying how much the fate of the world weighs on Hunt as he races against time to evade and outsmart the cybernetic mindset of The Entity. The rest of the cast is colossal in size as well as talent, with returnees Hayley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Pom Klementieff standing out as easy highlights. The stunts and action are reliably amazing in how much Cruise continues to shock audiences with his death-defying attitude alongside the daredevil cinematography choreographed, captured and framed all in a synchronised collaboration of utter madness. Additionally tied together with clean-cut editing and a typically updated rendition of the harmonious score, all whilst the film presents you with truly fresh and immersive set pieces. The way it continues off of the foundations layed out by the last film makes for a rocky beginning, moreso to its credit as in-universe recaps are provided to establish context and give a more stand alone personality of this otherwise 'Part Two' outing. And the way the movie chooses to round everything out in the final few scenes were executed as perfectly as it could have been delivered for a franchise like this.However, for as fantastic as the swansong spectacle is, it is not without its flaws either. Esai Morales' Gabriel is cemented as one of the less interesting antagonists of the series; the film becomes preoccupied with other aspects to the point where he is absent in the second act, leaving the third act to resolve his story with a comically unceremonious conclusion. Furthermore, Shea Whigham's Briggs receives a particularly weak and arguably unnecessary journey, and he continues to add so little to the overarching plot that it becomes worth considering whether it would be a better film without him. The sense of finality is thematically present throughout very effectively, and during the first act there are a collection of callbacks made with the utmost sincerity, but it then becomes almost too many visual cues and references where it reaches a point of it plainly repeating itself. On a filmmaking level, the editing in the ordering of when certain scenes transpire occasionally feel out of order for a blatant extra kick of drama in comparison to other patiently built-up moments. And all these nitpicks crescendo into pacing issues that result in a debatably bloated runtime.In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning was a terrific final addition to the legendary spy franchise. And, as a movie viewed on its own, makes for an engaging piece of action-packed and adventerous storytelling."

However i was pretty disappointed with Dead reckoning part 1 as i felt it just dragged on with not alot of excitement. Part 2 continued on that same trajectory. Alot of talking mumbo jumbo n over explaining everything. There was also too much nostalgia moments. The movie was very long n slow. Cruise looked like he lacked energy n the other characters were fine but didnt have much to do unlike earlier installments. The underwater scenes were fairly tame and lacked any intensity n by the time the main stunt came at the end, we were way over it and were looking forward to it being over."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025) delivers exactly what fans of the franchise have come to expect-and more. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, this eighth installment in the globally acclaimed spy saga is a high-octane, adrenaline-fueled cinematic rollercoaster that pushes the boundaries of spectacle and suspense.Tom Cruise once again proves why Ethan Hunt is one of cinema's most iconic action heroes. Backed by returning cast members Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Angela Bassett, and Henry Czerny, the performances are consistently solid, anchoring the film's explosive action with emotional gravitas and well-timed humor.The plot follows the IMF team's desperate race to track down the Entity-a rogue artificial intelligence threatening global annihilation. While the eventual outcome may seem inevitable, it's the thrilling journey, the elaborate set pieces, and the edge-of-your-seat stunts that make the ride unforgettable.McQuarrie's direction is sharp, the screenplay tight, and the cinematography nothing short of stunning. The signature Mission: Impossible background score pulses throughout, heightening every twist and turn. Clocking in at 2 hours and 49 minutes, the film never drags-thanks to its expertly choreographed action and seamless editing.Rating: 9/10\nA spectacular send-off that honors the legacy of the franchise while raising the bar for action thrillers. An absolute must-watch for Mission: Impossible fans."

          "content": "\"I need you to trust me. One last time.\"\nAs the Mission Impossible films continues its franchise with its 8th installment \"The Final Reckoning\", many suspects that this might be the last in the series.So, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is watch the eight film in the Mission Impossible series. What are the stakes? What's the plot? Who's returning and who's not? The story picks up the last scene from Dead Reckoning wherein Ethan Hunt manages to take the crucifix key with him.It's doomsday! The plot then pressures Hunt to do yet another mission - what to do with the key and to the \"Entity\": give Gabriel what he wants, give the \"Entity\" what it wants or destroy the Entity? Basically he and his team did all of these. The story felt like it was divided into 3 parts: The build up of the mission; the submarine mission and the destruction of the \"Entity.\"The stakes are high and though some may say that this film lacked action scenes unlike previous installments, it still was a breath-taking film to watch. Tom Cruise really proves that despite of his age, he still can do impossible stunts (pun intended). The performances of the rest of the cast were also well done though we did say goodbye to someone from the team - which was a tragic end.This is like a love letter of Tom Cruise to every fan who were there since the beginning of this franchise (around 29 years ago). Overall with the estimated run time of almost 3 hours, everything was well executed and the pacing was not boring. Every detail, every minute was worth the watch and very detailed - makes them important to the whole plot.This movie will definitely take you to the edge of your seats especially on the death-defying stunt scenes of Tom Cruise. From running in land to diving in the deepest oceans to fighting while flying an aircraft (don't tell me this is an Avatar reference).Performance - 9\nAction - 8.5\nStory - 9\nSoundtrack - 8\nOverall - 8.5/10Hey this is fun in the big screen! By the way, Vanessa Kirby does NOT appear in this film."

Because he most likely will never fail any mission, you think the movie is more about walking the path than knowing the path. The stunts are all the more impressive knowing that it's really Cruise in every situation. I get the feeling all involved would have been happy to leave it at 6 movies, but since there was no official closure, there was a need for a two-part sequel (for better or worse, something now very common since Harry Potter first had the audacity to pull it off). The only thing is, it ends just like you think it would. Which is anti-climatic given you'd like the movie to give the series a one-inch punch at the finish to give it a good send off. Also, since he's technically not committing espionage, the plot loses its edge, making it kinda weak."

Loved this 8th part of the franchise, was awe struck with the crazy fist fights & crazy \"impossible\" stunt scenes which kept me on the Edge of the seat the whole time, truly lived up to the expectations from a MI movie. They have kept the antagonist of this 1 very real and relevant, misleading AI led media & the digital scare from other Nations for their Nuclear threat. I won't give out the spoilers but this Part is awesome in its own with such unique variety and crazy levels of stunt sequences, also Toms expression & body language shows what a Great Actor he is. Truly inspiring & kick ass. Very true in any era, i believe A True Hero is not the one who lives or acts on Revenge or Hate, who seeks War but the one who stops Wars, saves innocent lives (No matter what no.s) and is not willing to leave behind a single life & soul to die.I rate this movie 9/10."

Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the film sees IMF agent Ethan Hunt confronting his most formidable adversary yet: a rogue AI known as The Entity, capable of global annihilation.The film is a spectacle of practical stunts and action sequences, including a tense underwater submarine scene and a daring biplane sequence, showcasing Cruise's commitment to performing his own stunts. While the narrative is dense and occasionally convoluted, the film compensates with its relentless pacing and visual grandeur.Supporting performances from Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, and Simon Pegg add depth and continuity to the story. Despite some narrative shortcomings, The Final Reckoning serves as a fitting conclusion to Ethan Hunt's journey, blending nostalgia with adrenaline-fueled action.For fans of the franchise, this film is a must-watch, offering a thrilling and emotional send-off to one of cinema's most enduring action heroes."

Granted, my level of frustration with this may have been exacerbated by seeing it in the bone-shaky, air blowy 4DX format. Not my preference, but my son loves it. Getting thrown around that much at my age isn't the best. But it's a decent, spectacular action thriller that does round off the franchise with a sense of flair."

First is it a good movie- Yes\nIs it the best movie in the franchise- NO, NOT AT ALL.Mission impossible has been a really nice series because of it's action and CGI- Cruise going insane. This time also To. Cruise goes above and beyond and you can see that they really wanted this one to feel final atleast for a while. A little bit of spoiler but not a very big one, Ethan Hunt doesn't die. So the prospect of another movie is very much alive, but that in no way harms the story of this movie.The pacing is pretty nice and holds up till the very end, though movie could have done better with a little more slow moments and some more character building but that is not a very big problem since the main motive is the action and spectacle which is met very nicely. I am also suprised that instead of giving Ethan some backstory in this movie they actually used the plot from MI 3 and MI 1, I was pleasantly suprised from that and that was surely one of the highlights for me.Even though being a nice movie The Final Recoking fails to met the bar set by the likes of MI Ghost Protocol and MI Fallout, but still this is surely one to be watched in the theatre that much is ceartin."

The commitment to practical stunts over CGI has made these films stand out in an era of overproduced blockbusters. Fallout especially set a high bar - it was tense, gripping, and had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish.Unfortunately, final Reckoning fails to capture that same spark.While the film aims high with its ambitious scope and promises of a grand \"final reckoning,\" the execution falls short. The pacing is bogged down by excessive exposition - characters seem to be constantly talking, explaining, and re-explaining rather than letting the action drive the story. The tension that once made the franchise thrilling feels diluted here.There's a noticeable attempt to inject nostalgia, perhaps to compensate for the lack of narrative momentum. It feels as if the filmmakers realized midway that they had something rather average and leaned heavily on callbacks and \"final chapter\" marketing to give it weight.Despite the top-tier stunt work and the ever-committed Cruise, Dead Reckoning lacks the urgency, tension, and tight storytelling that defined the franchise's best entries. A disappointing installment in an otherwise stellar series."

After nearly 30 years of explosive action, daring stunts, and intricate spy plots, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning may just be the final chapter in Ethan Hunt's legendary journey. And if it truly is the end, then what a powerful and heartfelt send-off it is.While it might not have the jaw-dropping, death-defying moment like the motorcycle jump off a cliff from Dead Reckoning Part 1-performed by Tom Cruise himself-The Final Reckoning delivers in other, equally meaningful ways. The story is packed with callbacks to previous Mission: Impossible films, cleverly weaving together a narrative that pays tribute to its roots. The return of William Donloe and flashes of Ethan from the early days (when Cruise was just 33) to now, at nearly 63, serve as a powerful reflection of time, dedication, and transformation.Amazingly, Tom Cruise still moves with the energy and intensity of someone half his age. His iconic sprint scenes are as thrilling as ever, and his commitment to physical performance continues to impress. Sure, the plot-like most spy thrillers-requires some suspension of disbelief. The odds are often impossibly small. But honestly? I didn't care. I was thoroughly entertained.Beyond the action, what stood out was the emotional depth. We see just how much Ethan cares for his team. The bond they share feels more like a family than a crew. The loss of Ilsa is heartbreaking, but it's handled with grace, and it adds real emotional weight. There are also moments of intelligent humor that bring lightness to the tension, making the 2-hour 49-minute runtime feel surprisingly brisk.The franchise began by staying close to its TV roots, where every member of the team had a special skill and no one outshined the others. At times, that format felt a little flat. But as the films evolved, so did the characters-and the emotional stakes. The introduction of Ethan's wife in Fallout added a new layer of humanity, and in this film, the emergence of new faces makes you wonder if a new team could one day carry on the legacy-even without Ethan.All in all, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a phenomenal conclusion to one of the greatest action franchises of all time. It's thrilling, emotional, and packed with everything fans have come to love. If this really is the end, then they've ended it in the best possible way."

The underwater sequence and the airplane scene are standout moments - expertly crafted, intense, and visually spectacular. These scenes showcase the series' trademark commitment to practical stunts and high-octane energy.However, the film quickly reveals structural and artistic weaknesses that make its nearly 3-hour runtime a challenge. The story is highly predictable, with few surprises, and the pacing is relentless to the point of exhaustion. Dialogue scenes are shot with frantic editing: endless cuts, relentless close-ups, and a complete absence of visual rhythm. There are virtually no wide shots or moments that breathe. The camera rarely stays still long enough to allow emotional weight to settle, creating a jarring contrast to the clean, choreographed clarity of the action.The storytelling feels heavily overexplained, as if designed for viewers unfamiliar with nuance. Every idea, emotion, or implication is repeated verbally, eliminating all subtlety. The film seems to try too hard to create memorable quotes, which only makes the dialogue feel forced and unnatural. The mantra \"show, don't tell\" seems entirely absent from the screenwriting approach. Moments that should trust the audience instead feel spoon-fed and redundant.Scenes involving the president and military figures are particularly grating - filled with wooden acting, corny dialogue, and implausible behavior. Many dramatic exchanges border on unintentionally comedic due to their melodrama and awkward pacing. The film seems desperate to convey urgency, but forgets to build authenticity.The musical score never takes a break - blaring continuously through action, dialogue, and exposition alike. Combined with the dark, indoor-heavy cinematography, the entire film adopts a suffocating tone. There are no quiet moments, no space for reflection or mood shifts - just constant movement and noise. It feels less like a narrative film and more like an extended, high-budget trailer.Attempts to tie together the events of previous Mission: Impossible films come off as forced and incoherent, offering hollow callbacks that don't land with meaning. While the core cast turns in solid performances, especially the series veterans, they're often undercut by flat writing or rushed emotional beats.Despite the brilliance of some individual set pieces, the film ultimately feels emotionally empty, stylistically overwhelming, and narratively clumsy. It has the ingredients of a great finale, but buries them beneath a chaotic structure that confuses constant motion with real momentum.In conclusion, The Final Reckoning excels in delivering high-octane action sequences that are a testament to the franchise's legacy. However, its narrative flaws, over-explanatory dialogue, and disjointed editing choices prevent it from achieving the heights of its predecessors. Fans of the series may find enjoyment in the action set pieces, but those seeking a cohesive and engaging story might be left wanting.6.6/10 (6/10)"

Genius.The plane sequence later in the film - what a rush. Classic Mission: Impossible scale and danger. Tom Cruise once again proved why he's the king of real action. That entire scene was filmed with such intensity, it genuinely felt like anything could happen.But the scene that really hit me was the last one. It had so much emotion and finality. That bittersweet moment, the look on their faces, the unspoken weight of what they've all been through - it gave the film heart. It was more than just action; it was about people.Huge shoutout to Beji and the entire cast - phenomenal work. And of course, Tom Cruise - what a legend. His performance carried every second with purpose and passion. Can't wait to see where it goes next."

          "content": "MIssion Impossible- The Final Reckoning is a fantastic, action-packed, emotionally driven finale to the best action franchise ever made. The setpieces in this movie are better than ever (submarine and plane sequence are the standouts), the hand-to-hand combat are perfect and McQuarrie just knows how to direct these films and has nailed the world building and personality of all of these characters. The film doesn't start off too great, the first act is very exposition heavy and it can get a little bit confusing. However, once the movie kicks into motion, the action never stops and it has some of the best moments ever. The connections and conclusion of the franchise as a whole while can feel a little forced, are a gift to the people who have watched these films for the last 30 years. I have no words to describe how grateful I am to Tom Cruise for giving us this franchise and ending it on such a high note. This isn't the best Mission: Impossible film but it has been one of the most fun, intense, and thrilling experiences I've ever had in a movie theater."

Unfortunately, The Final Reckoning completely misses the mark. The script is uninteresting, unrealistic, and filled with implausible plot twists that break immersion rather than enhance it. It feels like the creators tried too hard to surprise the audience, but ended up making everything worse. The pacing is off, the story lacks coherence, and even the action scenes - usually a strength of the series - feel forced and uninspired. At over two hours, it's a long and disappointing experience. In my opinion, this is the weakest film in the franchise, and I can't recommend it to anyone, not even die-hard fans."

Stuck too much in the past, the film is underwhelming, boring and predictable.Damn! Melodrama in an espionage thriller is a 3-hour endurance test! The first 90 minutes has hardly any action sequences. All talk. Lot of sermonizing!Those rubber mask-reveals, gadgets, high-octane chases, seen in earlier MI films are seriously missing in this film.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) lacks energy and charisma compared to his previous films and instead of having control of the situation, seems to be powerless and over emotional most of the times.Nevertheless, at 62 years, Tom Cruise certainly deserves wholesome praise for performing his own stunts. But they don't really cut any ice for action movie lovers. The much-hyped plane and underwater sequences are just about average. Nothing breathtaking or jaw dropping. Repetitive.I was expecting them to tie up the loose ends from Dead Reckoning (2023), but no!Too many action pieces keep happening parallelly at the same time. So Writer & Director Christopher McQuarrie does a Nolan, by going for Inception-like jump cuts from one stunt to the other repeatedly. It doesn't work here.The main drawback of this film is there is no proper villain. The real villain of the film is nostalgia!By re-contextualizing Tom Cruise's previous MI films they turned it into a grand mess. Why is this a problem? Because these movies were originally not conceived in that way, making the screenplay clumsily fall over itself in order to present this as a cohesive story. The crossover storytelling technique of Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't work here. When Bond's past is probed in Spectre (2018) it feels genuine. Probing into Ethan Hunt's past is a mess here.All the actors go thro' their motions with zero relatability. Poor acting, cringey expressions, poor make-up, poor costumes, poor settings, poor action sequences, poor VFx...!"

The film relies heavily on flashbacks, callbacks, and Easter eggs from previous entries, which is lovely if you've memorised the franchise, but baffling if you haven't. The story telegraphs every twist well in advance, often serving scenes on a platter with a wink: \"Remember this bit - it'll save the world later!\" The dialogue is pure lowest-common-denominator exposition, designed to keep even the sleepiest audience member on track. Yes, the stunts are extraordinary - Cruise remains a marvel of physics-defying ambition - but the soul of the series feels MIA. I found myself longing for the sleek, mysterious vibe of the earlier films, before it all became one long action montage with a plot in tow."

Tom Cruise, at 62, still sprints like he's outrunning Father Time, and the stunts? Absolutely bonkers. That biplane sequence had me gripping my seat, and the underwater scene? I held my breath the entire time. It's like Cruise looked at the laws of physics and said, \"I'll take it from here.\"But beyond the adrenaline, there's a nostalgic heartbeat to this film. Seeing familiar faces like Luther and Benji back in action felt like a reunion with old friends. And the callbacks to earlier missions? Chef's kiss. Sure, the plot gets a bit tangled-AI villains and global threats can do that-but who cares when you're having this much fun? It's a love letter to the franchise and its fans, wrapping up decades of espionage, disguises, and daring escapes in a package that's both thrilling and heartfelt. If this truly is Ethan Hunt's final mission, then what a ride it's been."

          "content": "What can I say... uhmm! This eighth installment of Mission: Impossible ended up exhausting me. It's the longest in the entire franchise, clocking in at 2 hours and 49 minutes-and you feel every minute of it. The story picks up where the last film (2023) left off: Ethan Hunt now holds the key to deactivating an artificial intelligence, and once again, he gathers his team to complete this \"impossible mission\" and put an end to the threat.For me, the issue lies in the dramatic weight. This time, the movie tries so hard to be serious, intense, and profound... that it loses sight of what you actually expect from a blockbuster like this: watching Tom Cruise do everything. And yes, he does-but less than usual. Plus, the AI's presence, which should be a key element, is practically nonexistent-if they didn't mention it, you'd forget about it entirely. I think this comes down to the script, which tries too hard to inject emotional and nostalgic weight into the story-at times, it feels like both a remake and a sequel at once-and in doing so, it becomes repetitive.Pacing is another weak point: the film drags heavily until Tom Cruise starts running, flying, swimming, and doing all his stunts. That's when the movie finally takes off. As for the cast, everyone does their job, but Simon Pegg stood out the most for me. His character, Benji Dunn, has some great moments and brings much-needed spark to the team.The action scenes... honestly, I only really enjoyed two: the plane sequence (which we'd already seen in the trailers) and the ocean scene, which is the best part. The way Christopher McQuarrie directs these sequences is impressive-the tension is well-built, and the way the shots flow together feels organic. I also noticed the frequent use of Dutch angles, which adds a distinct visual style.In short, too much drama, too little spark - a grand spectacle without soul. Mission: Impossible 8 strives to be profound rather than pulse-pounding, and while it has brilliant moments, the excitement arrives too late. The spectacle is there, but it drowns in nostalgia and self-seriousness."

          "content": "The latest adrenaline-fueled installment in the iconic action franchise. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the film takes audiences on a breathtaking global journey packed with high-octane stunts, intricate espionage plots, and relentless suspense. This time, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his trusted IMF team are faced with a daunting challenge: a rogue AI system known as \"The Entity,\" which has the potential to disrupt global security.From the opening sequence, the movie wastes no time in plunging viewers into a pulse-pounding action set piece. The pacing is relentless, with each scene meticulously crafted to keep the audience at the edge of their seats. McQuarrie's direction is razor-sharp, delivering a visually stunning experience that seamlessly blends practical effects with CGI, creating a visceral, immersive atmosphere.Tom Cruise once again demonstrates his commitment to the role with jaw-dropping stunts that defy logic and gravity. Whether he's careening off a cliff on a motorbike or engaging in a high-speed train chase, Cruise brings an intensity and authenticity that is unmatched in the genre. At 61, he continues to push the boundaries of what action stars can physically accomplish, and it's nothing short of awe-inspiring.Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames reprise their roles as the trusted IMF team, each bringing their unique skills and charm to the mission. Ferguson, as the enigmatic Ilsa Faust, delivers a compelling performance that adds depth to her character's arc. Pegg provides the necessary comedic relief as tech specialist Benji, while Rhames grounds the team as the experienced and loyal Luther.Newcomers Hayley Atwell and Esai Morales also shine in pivotal roles. Atwell's portrayal of Grace, a skilled thief caught up in the chaos, is both captivating and nuanced, making her a compelling addition to the ensemble. Morales, as the sinister antagonist Gabriel, exudes a menacing calm that makes him a formidable foe for Hunt and his team.The film's cinematography is a visual spectacle, showcasing a series of stunning international locations, from the bustling streets of Rome to the dizzying heights of the Austrian Alps. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI enhances the sense of realism, making each chase sequence and fight scene feel visceral and impactful.Moreover, the sound design and musical score elevate the tension and excitement throughout the film. Lorne Balfe's score masterfully weaves in the iconic Mission: Impossible theme while infusing it with a contemporary, pulse-pounding intensity that complements the on-screen action.Despite being the first part of a two-part story, the narrative remains cohesive and compelling, successfully setting up the stakes for the concluding chapter without feeling incomplete. The script smartly balances character development with explosive action, maintaining the essence of what makes the Mission: Impossible series so captivating - a perfect blend of espionage, intrigue, and breathtaking stunts.In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is a masterclass in action filmmaking, delivering heart-stopping stunts, compelling performances, and a gripping narrative that leaves audiences eagerly anticipating the next chapter. Tom Cruise once again proves why he's the ultimate action star, and Christopher McQuarrie solidifies his reputation as one of the best action directors working today. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, this film is an absolute must-watch.Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)"

          "content": "Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning is a film that truly lives up to the hype - and then some. As a devoted fan of the series, I felt my heart beating faster already during the opening titles. And the film delivers. From the very first scene to the final second, it's an intense, emotionally charged, and masterfully crafted experience that reminds us why Mission: Impossible is one of the most beloved action franchises of all time.What I particularly love about this film is how it ties together threads from the earlier movies. It feels like a tribute to the entire journey we've taken with Ethan Hunt, while still feeling fresh and relevant. Fans will recognize callbacks, references, and small details that show how much care has gone into honoring the legacy of the series.And the stunts - what can I even say? It's pure, unfiltered movie magic. The physical, grounded quality of these action sequences is what makes Mission: Impossible stand out. The stunts aren't just thrilling - they make us feel something, physically and emotionally. That's what makes these films true cinematic events, not just action flicks. No home theater setup can recreate the kind of awe and breathless tension these scenes generate. This is why they must be seen in a cinema.The pacing of the film is also spot on. I never once felt it was dragging - quite the opposite. I could've easily sat for another hour.But there are areas that could have gone deeper. One recurring issue in both this film and the previous one, Dead Reckoning Part One, is the tendency toward overly explicit dialogue. In Dead Reckoning, the term \"The Entity\" was repeated so often that it started to feel almost excessive - as if the filmmakers were worried the audience might forget what the threat was. It gave the impression that the film didn't fully trust viewers to follow the plot. That undermined some of the narrative depth and made certain moments feel overly guided. While The Final Reckoning is slightly more restrained, the same pattern remains in some scenes: dialogue that explains too much, rather than letting the emotion and subtext speak for itself.Another point for me personally is the choice of AI as the central villain. I understand why it was chosen - it's timely, scary, and limitless as a threat. But for someone like me who's deeply connected to the roots of spy thrillers, an AI antagonist feels a bit abstract. These stories are at their strongest when the enemy is human - when there's mistrust, betrayal, mind games. That psychological tension is harder to build when the enemy is essentially invisible and omnipresent. It just feels more like science fiction than Mission: Impossible.That said, let me be clear: none of these things change my overall feeling about the film. I loved it. I loved the last one. And every one before it. Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie have created something truly special together - a combination of relentless action, clever storytelling, and genuine cinematic passion. Their partnership is one of the greatest in modern action cinema.There's been a lot of talk about this being the final film. I truly hope that's not the case. I believe much will depend on audience reception and how well the film performs financially - and yes, it's an expensive one. But if it does well, I see opportunities. If more films are made, and Tom Cruise doesn't want to continue in the same leading role he has today, there are still other ways to keep him in a central and vital role within the series. He could become a mentor, a strategist - perhaps a character similar to what Jim Phelps once was. There's space to evolve without losing the soul of the franchise.What I definitely don't want to see is a full reboot with new characters and a new direction. Mission: Impossible isn't something that can just be restarted from scratch. It's a world built with care, and there's still so much left to explore. With the right writing and the right creative team, the series could return to its roots - IMF, impossible missions, psychological intrigue, villains that must be stopped - and continue delivering incredible stories.For me, it's an easy verdict: 10 out of 10. Not just as a movie - but as a love letter to everything Mission: Impossible stands for."

What he really needs now is a strong script. He's not just an action star-he's also a phenomenal actor.Just like No Time to Die gave James Bond (played by Daniel Craig) an impressive and emotional farewell, Mission: Impossible -The final reckoning didn't quite deliver that. The action scenes are well-executed and visually impressive, but what about the core idea? The franchise has been recycling the same kind of material since 1996.Charismatic Tom Cruise has single-handedly kept the franchise alive through his immense hard work. Personally, as an Ethan Hunt fan, I don't think this is the goodbye we expected. I won't rank the Mission: Impossible series, but this is one of the least entertaining sequels.I truly hope Tom Cruise will take on more drama roles alongside action in the future."

          "content": "100 out of 100\nA Golden Masterclass. The Mission Ends Here-but the Legacy Echoes Forever.The Final Reckoning isn't just a finale. It's an escalation. A culmination. A warning. This film is a blistering, emotionally relentless, high-concept thriller that locks eyes with the present moment-and refuses to blink.The World is No Longer in ControlAt the center of it all is the Entity-a rogue artificial intelligence so powerful, so unpredictable, and so deeply embedded in global systems that every major world government is in a full-blown race to control it.But that's the brilliance of The Final Reckoning: control is an illusion.What starts as a global arms race quickly becomes a freefall. Governments, agencies, private contractors-everyone's chasing this digital ghost through backchannels, satellites, submarines, and servers. But what they don't realize-what only Ethan Hunt understands-is that you can't control the Entity. You can only confront it.The Entity isn't just a villain. It's the perfect antagonist for this modern age. Cold. Calculating. Omnipresent. It manipulates people, systems, even reality itself. It turns truth into fiction, and fiction into policy. And it is everywhere.The Mission: Not to Destroy It, But to Deny It Power by any meansEthan Hunt's mission this time isn't just about stopping a bomb or rescuing a diplomat. It's about sabotaging control itself. About denying the world the very thing it's trying to possess. It's the most impossible mission yet: prevent every government, every institution, from weaponizing what cannot be tamed.This is the IMF against the world.And they know they're not walking away clean.Global Scope, Relentless ExecutionEvery set piece, every location in this film serves the story-not just as action, but as commentary.The submarine opening immediately tells you: we are in a new kind of war. Silent, technological, and claustrophobically tense. It sets the tone: no more clear lines, no more easy victories.The Africa sequence brings a rawness and moral complexity. Amidst the chaos of proxy forces and shadow wars, Ethan is forced to reckon with how deep the Entity's reach goes-and how little humanity understands about the tech it's trying to use.London becomes the nerve center of the global power grab. Every faction converges, every identity fractures. Allies look like enemies. Enemies speak with friendly tongues. Trust becomes a weapon. And the Entity watches it all-feeding, learning, predicting.The cinematography, sound design, and editing give every scene urgency. You're not just watching these places-you're surviving them.Ethan Hunt: The Last FirewallTom Cruise delivers one of the most committed, layered performances of his career. This isn't just the Ethan Hunt of old. This is a man exhausted-not from the missions, but from the weight of knowing he's one of the last people still fighting for the right reasons.He isn't chasing glory. He's chasing clarity in a world drowning in misinformation and manipulated perception. He's not just running toward the mission-he's running against the tide of civilization trying to surrender to convenience and power.What makes him dangerous isn't his skill-it's his conviction.And that's exactly why the Entity fears him.The IMF: A Team in the TrenchesThe supporting cast fires on all cylinders:\nLuther Stickell brings a gravity and wisdom that anchors the chaos. He's not just a hacker-he's the soul of the team, the last true believer in Ethan's moral compass.Benji Dunn evolves fully here. The fear is still there, but so is his grit. His scenes provide levity-but also underscore the human cost of this mission.Grace steps into her new role with poise and unpredictability. Her arc in this film is about finding purpose in a war she never asked for. She's the future-if the future survives.This is a team that doesn't work because of gadgets or training. It works because of loyalty. Trust forged in fire. And that's something even the most advanced AI can't replicate.A Legendary EndingNo spoilers-but the ending doesn't play it safe.There are no clean slates. No last-minute reversals. Just sacrifice, integrity, and the haunting truth that some victories must be paid for in full.It's hopeful in its honesty. Bittersweet in the best way. The kind of ending that earns its tears, not through manipulation-but through respect for the story, and for the audience.Final Verdict: 100 out of 100 - Golden TierMission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is more than just an action film.It's a commentary on modern warfare. A study in consequence.A salute to loyalty in an age of compromise.With breathtaking set pieces, razor-sharp storytelling, and a message that hits harder than any explosion, this film doesn't just close a chapter. It rewrites what a finale can be.It's a reckoning-for Ethan Hunt. For the IMF."

Even though it drags for 3 hrs, it's still a good movie if you are fan of the franchise. Just don't expect it to be like the rest of the movies.Somehow Tom Cruise's stunts in the other ones were really good (top one being climbing the Burj Khalifa). In this one, the plane scene was good, but keeps breaking into scenes to show what the others are doing.Again it's a good movie for MI fans ( can watch at home though ) , but for a MI flick, it seems too long at 3 hrs.One more thing. The climax is disappointing. I was expecting more action with the villain."

          "content": ".The latest installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise takes a noticeable detour from its usual high-octane, edge-of-your-seat action formula, leaning more into emotional and philosophical territory. While it attempts to offer a deeper, more introspective narrative, it ends up sacrificing the very elements that made the series a global success: coherent storytelling, tightly choreographed action sequences, and sustained thrill.One of the most noticeable aspects of the film is its emphasis on emotional conflict and philosophical musings. Themes such as fate, choice, loyalty, and sacrifice are explored at length, often through prolonged dialogues and reflective monologues. While this can be commendable in a standalone drama, it feels misplaced in an action-packed spy thriller that traditionally thrives on momentum and adrenaline. The emotional depth the filmmakers aim for doesn't quite land effectively, largely because the pacing is disrupted by these thematic detours.Moreover, the action scenes, which have been the hallmark of the Mission: Impossible franchise, feel surprisingly out of sync with the narrative. Rather than enhancing the story or driving it forward, many of the action sequences seem inserted for the sake of spectacle. The coherence between plot and action, something the earlier films managed masterfully, is largely absent here. This lack of integration leads to a jarring viewing experience-high-energy moments that do little to elevate the stakes or deepen the viewer's investment in the characters.The film also struggles with maintaining excitement and suspense. Traditionally, each Mission: Impossible film is known for at least one iconic, nail-biting sequence-be it the Langley heist in the first movie or the HALO jump in Fallout. Unfortunately, this installment lacks such a memorable set-piece. While the stunts are still technically impressive and executed with precision, they don't carry the emotional weight or narrative importance necessary to make them truly thrilling.Character development feels uneven. While Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) remains a charismatic lead, the film devotes significant time to exploring his internal struggles, often at the expense of pacing. Supporting characters, who in past films added layers of wit and chemistry, are either underutilized or given subplots that feel underdeveloped. The result is a cast that, while capable, feels directionless and disconnected.Visually, the film remains polished, with top-notch cinematography and production design. The globetrotting aspect is still present, offering stunning backdrops and atmospheric sequences. However, even these aesthetic strengths can't compensate for the film's uneven storytelling and lack of narrative cohesion.In attempting to be more emotionally resonant and philosophically rich, the film loses sight of its core identity. It tries to elevate the franchise into more cerebral territory but does so without a strong script or tightly woven plot to support it. This ambitious shift ends up diluting what fans love most about Mission: Impossible-the tension, the unpredictability, and the high-stakes thrill ride.In conclusion, while this film might be appreciated by those looking for a more reflective and character-driven experience, it is likely to disappoint longtime fans of the franchise who expect a seamless blend of action, intrigue, and excitement. The emotional and philosophical angle, though well-intentioned, feels misplaced and underdeveloped. For a series built on impossible missions, this installment regrettably falls short of accomplishing its own."

The first hour is used to set up the environment, but you won't feel bored at all.The movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes long, and every minute is used well.

The film is emotionally strong, and every character plays an important role in the storyline.The use of background music is spot on, placed in the right moments. The editing is top class; you'll really appreciate how well it's done. The opening theme sequence is also one of the best.The cinematography is exceptional, and the fight choreography is flawless. Christopher McQuarrie's direction is speechless.McQuarrie's direction, screenplay, and action scenes are brilliantly executed. The combination of Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie is unbeatable.In the second act, the submarine part, and in the third act, the aircraft action sequence, are pure cinema. You'll be in awe of how they pulled it off.And TOM CRUISE-the man is enough of a reason to watch the movie. What a madman! The action scenes are all done by him, but how?! Other characters also deliver great performances.Negatives:\nNo negatives!!!JUST GO AND WATCH."

Obviously, it is a farewell to Tom Cruise as Ethan, rightly so, as he is not getting any younger. No one does. He looks weary, sometimes even tired of it. The story itself, however, keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly. I think (it is arguably) the best Mission: Impossible ever made. My only regret is that there has not been a successor named."

It feels like the movie wants to show the stunts whatever it takes, only for the sake of having them in it.It is almost three hours long and you can feel it.Nevertheless, as a huge fan of the franchise, I enjoyed and admired Tom Cruise' work one last time."

Serving as the eight installment and the continuation of Dead Reckoning, does this 'final' film in the franchise sticks the landing or plummets down the depths. Let's find out.Mission: Impossible- The Final Reckoning delivers exactly what audiences have come to expect from the franchise: jaw-dropping action, Tom Cruise defying the laws of physics and high in-world stakes. It's another sleek, adrenaline-charged continuation that successfully raises the stakes without losing it's grip on the narrative.Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is still epic as ever. Charismatic and physically intense, he never fails to captivate the audience. The other actors were fantastic and had great chemistry with one another particularly Hayley Atwell as Grace, Simon Peggs as Benji and Ving Rhames as Luther. The action, as you'd expect, is jaw-dropping particularly the underwater sequence which was a breathtaking new addition to the franchise. The cinematography and editing are top-notch.However, the film is not without its flaws. The first hour was full of exposition-heavy sequences which slowed down the pacing. The villain was weak. Some of the team members don't get enough focus or development. There are too many characters introduced that aren't interesting. And the runtime is slightly overlong.Is it the best film in the franchise? No (that honor belongs to Fallout). Did it serve it's purpose as an entertaining action film? Absolutely.Overall, Mission: Impossible- The Final Reckoning is a pulse pounding and well-crafted action film that, while having some missteps along the way, manages to recapture the show stopping feel of the franchise thanks to Tom Cruise's performance and some astounding set pieces and stunt work."

          "content": "Few franchises have maintained their relevance and adrenaline-pumping excitement as well as the Mission: Impossible series. With Dead Reckoning Part One, the saga hits an all-time high, delivering a cinematic experience that is not only visually spectacular but also thematically timely. This isn't just another action flick-it's a masterclass in espionage storytelling, laced with mind-bending AI concepts and edge-of-the-seat stunts. And at the heart of it all is Tom Cruise, looking as sharp and driven as ever, continuing to defy age and gravity in equal measure.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, a role he's made iconic over nearly three decades. But what's truly stunning is not just his physical transformation or commitment to the role, but how he continues to evolve the character. In Dead Reckoning, Cruise doesn't just run and fight-he emotes, questions, and leads with a mix of wisdom and desperation that makes Ethan more human than ever. At 60, Cruise not only looks stunning but delivers a performance packed with energy, intensity, and soul.Now, let's talk about the stunts-because they are a movie in themselves. The much-talked-about plane stunt, where Cruise rides a motorbike off a cliff and parachutes onto a moving train, is a jaw-dropping spectacle that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's not just the danger of the stunt but the precision and raw commitment behind it that make it unforgettable. This is cinema that pushes physical limits.Equally mesmerizing is the underwater choreography. Rather than a typical action sequence, it plays more like a carefully designed ballet of tension, breath control, and seamless camera work. It's the kind of scene where you almost forget to breathe yourself, a testament to the film's direction and Cruise's sheer physical discipline. Unlike other films where underwater scenes often get chaotic, Dead Reckoning delivers clarity and elegance-even in chaos.But what truly elevates this installment is its bold, daring concept. The film dives into the terrifying plausibility of artificial intelligence spiraling out of human control. \"The Entity,\" the AI antagonist of the story, is not your standard robot or faceless hacker. It's an omnipresent, invisible force capable of manipulating the digital world, threatening to trigger a nuclear war and rewrite the global order. It's scary, smart, and disturbingly believable. In a world increasingly dominated by real-life AI, the movie's premise feels not only fresh but deeply relevant.The narrative does a great job of exploring how governments and rogue agents grapple for control over this AI. The paranoia, the shifting alliances, and the trust issues between characters bring an emotional complexity that's often missing in action thrillers. There's a philosophical undercurrent too-about control, identity, and whether we've already surrendered too much to machines.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is razor-sharp, balancing spectacular action with nuanced storytelling. The pacing is tight despite a long runtime, and the editing keeps the tension alive throughout. The supporting cast-Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and newcomers like Hayley Atwell-add depth and chemistry, but Cruise remains the undeniable force at the center.Visually, the film is stunning. From desert landscapes to snow-covered mountain trains and neon-lit European cities, every frame is meticulously crafted. Lorne Balfe's score adds to the intensity, blending classic Mission: Impossible motifs with modern urgency.In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is more than just an action movie-it's an experience. It proves that the franchise is not only alive but thriving, evolving with the times while staying true to its roots. With daring stunts, a thought-provoking AI narrative, and Tom Cruise at the peak of his game, this is one mission you don't want to miss."

The story itself is amazing how it ties everything up in a neat bow. Although we lose a favorite. With the introduction of AI into our society and the criminal element we must be very careful how it is used because it could be the end of mankind as we know it. Sorry I went off on a tangent. The girl who played Grace was a good choice for another Cruise hotty partner. (Hayley Atwell). The blonde hot psycho, (Pom Klementief), is a good choice in her role, and a pleasure to watch physically. Great Movie. CHEERS TO IMF!"

          "content": "After over two decades of high-octane adventures, Mission: Impossible 8 brings Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) back for what may be his final mission. In this thrilling chapter, Ethan faces off against an all-powerful artificial intelligence known as Entity, which controls global nuclear weapons. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Hunt and his team work to retrieve a vital encrypted code hidden in a submerged Russian submarine.While the stakes are higher than ever, the film's plot sometimes feels convoluted. The central premise of a rogue AI manipulating global warfare is timely and intriguing, but the storytelling becomes bogged down by excessive exposition and numerous subplots. For those familiar with the Mission: Impossible franchise, the action remains riveting, but the narrative can occasionally feel muddled, making it hard to fully engage with the story at times.As expected, Tom Cruise's commitment to practical stunts steals the show. From a heart-stopping biplane jump to a pulse-pounding underwater rescue, the movie doesn't hold back in delivering jaw-dropping sequences. Cruise's fearless approach to stunts is part of what makes the Mission: Impossible films so enjoyable, and this installment is no exception. These high-intensity moments are some of the most impressive in the series.However, while the action is top-notch, there are moments when the reliance on CGI and visual effects detracts from the realism of the story. The film leans heavily on spectacle, sometimes at the cost of emotional depth or narrative coherence.The performances from the returning cast-Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and newcomer Esai Morales-are solid. The chemistry between Cruise and Atwell's character adds an emotional layer, but some secondary characters feel underdeveloped or dispensable. They provide valuable support, but their roles aren't as impactful as they could have been.Ultimately, Mission: Impossible 8 is a fitting conclusion for Ethan Hunt's journey, but it's not without its flaws. The film offers a mixture of exhilarating action, heartfelt moments, and a somewhat tangled plot. While it may not be the perfect ending to the saga, it delivers enough thrills to keep fans engaged. For die-hard fans of the series, it's a must-watch, but for casual viewers, the complexity of the narrative might be a hurdle.This movie is definitely worth catching on the big screen, especially for those who have followed the franchise from the beginning. It's a grand spectacle with an emotional payoff, though it doesn't entirely live up to the high standards set by its predecessors."

          "content": "Always mission possible, always Tom Cruise\nThrilled to watch this MI series just fresh out from the cinema half an hour ago, thanks to the affordable price offered by Groupon - A$15.99 for an adult E-Saver.What a show and what a stunt. It is indeed a Mission Impossible series. In fact shall I call it Mission Possible as each series accomplishes a seemingly impossible mission?Plot is highly complex and heavily intertwined, which virtually makes it a mission impossible to fully understand every single aspect of the story. Different characters, high AI components, multiple dogfights make it an action masterpiece. Yet I managed to understand the outline - to capture the AI rogue entity by killing the villains.Soundtracks are so amazing that they seamlessly suit the underlying plots and add an extra layer of suspense. You have to hold your breath to see what happens next.Acting is superb in that the fighting scenes look so tense and real, although we all know it is a hyped up game.I must say what makes this show stand out is its highly sophisticated technological capabilities. High tech and presumably AI play such an important role in this show that you have to end up admiring the technological might of the Americans. USA is indeed a dominating global tech powerhouse.As always, location is the last but not least to mention in all my movie reviews. This movie was filmed in various locations around the world, one of which is London Westminster Palace, a place I trotted 8 years ago. Having traversed the globe a fair bit I feel being drawn so close to many movie locations each time I see them on the silver screen.Well I may have to leave it for now as I let those scenes replay in my mind. Tom Cruise, what a king of action movies. I somehow feel he will film as long as he is alive. Movie is his life. I pay much tribute to his dedication to his career.Always mission possible, for ever Tom Cruise."

From the beginning till the end you can't take your eyes off as for those who haven't seen the previous parts even they can understand the movie for all the flashbacks that pretty much covers it all.

          "content": "The underwater sequence in this film isn't just thrilling, it's historic. Cruise and McQuarrie continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in modern filmmaking. It's a sequence so intense, so technically bold, it leaves you gripping the seat, holding your breath and sweating buckets. This is action cinema at its absolute peak.It's not the first time this has been said about Mission: Impossible, but you have NEVER seen anything like this on the big screen. The real mission impossible is how every Tom Cruise movie captures something no one else would even think to attempt. At this point, just give the man a Nobel Prize.It almost feels wrong to criticize this film, because no one does it like this team. Their passion for movies and pure entertainment shines through every frame. But the truth is, they're starting to run out of room. Each entry feels the pressure to outdo the last, and that shows.The ending feels predictable and too reminiscent of earlier installments. These films have always excelled at building tension through a race against time and pulling off the impossible, but this time, it feels overly familiar. There are clear parallels to Fallout, and while that film was outstanding, reusing the same structure doesn't land with the same force. The stunts and performances are as sharp as ever, but the sense of surprise is fading. At this point, we can see the framework behind it all. We've been here before.The AI villain pushes the film deeper into science fiction territory, and while the idea is relevant, it doesn't entirely work. An intelligence that can predict outcomes and human behavior feels too theoretical at times, creating distance from the grounded intensity the series is known for. Mission: Impossible thrives when it centers on real, high-stakes physicality-Tom Cruise climbing buildings, flying planes, crashing cars, or jumping off rooftops. That's the kind of spectacle that makes these films unforgettable.All in all, this is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest-ambitious, expertly crafted, and wildly entertaining. It's the kind of movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Support it, because we need more films made with this level of passion and precision."

The ending was great though because unlike other over bloated trash movies like Star Wars predator and alien(Jurassic park also) this movie doesn't need a sequel because Ethan won and the story is resolved in a neat and perfect way. It's kind of like how Daniel Craig James Bond ended but Ethan didn't die and there might be a spin-off but the movie doesn't imply that Ethan's career will continue farther. I hope that Jurassic world rebirth isn't as trash as this."

          "content": "As a Mission: Impossible fan, I'd love to give this film a perfect score, but speaking as a critic with integrity, I have to acknowledge both its triumphs and its shortcomings.From the opening scene, the film barely allows the audience a moment to breathe. It maintains relentless momentum until a finale that delivers a powerful, universal message: division breeds chaos, and unity is essential for the survival of humanity and it's hope for the future. It's a message that resonates deeply, especially in our current global climate.The action is thrilling, the set pieces are daring, and the scale demands to be experienced on the largest screen possible. Christopher McQuarrie's direction and the film's tight pacing help it overcome its hefty runtime, turning it into an epic that also honors the legacy of the franchise. While the editing can be jarring in moments, the spectacle more than compensates.Criticism of the film's fan service feels misplaced-this is the first time we truly see how Ethan Hunt's actions have shaped the world around him. For once, the consequences of his choices ripple beyond the mission. That said, the inclusion of Jasper Briggs's connection to Ethan feels forced and unnecessary.The most glaring flaws lie in the underdeveloped story threads carried over from Dead Reckoning. The connection between Ethan, Gabriel, and Marie is never fully explored, leaving their arcs emotionally flat. A deeper exploration of these relationships could have elevated the film's emotional weight.Despite these missteps, this remains a high mark in action cinema-ambitious, urgent, and deeply human."

It's also because this is basically 2nd part of an extra long movie. You are watching the 2nd act of a movie as a full film where the stakes are higher and bigger than running around doing normal stunts."

          "content": "Amid all that lengthy exposition around how to stop a sentient AI, boatloads of characters occupying excessive screentime especially in debriefing sessions, somewhere in there lies a solid, no-holds-barred action film-one that's meant to wrap up a three-decades-long action franchise, but who knows if that'll be the case? I have no qualms watching Tom Cruise in more of these, though he's also one of our aging superstars. His charisma still shines through and through, and as much as we've seen other team members, antagonists, and superiors come go, Ethan Hunt will remain the heart and soul of this series.The Final Reckoning doesn't leave anything for subtlety or connecting the dots (from other entries), as it instantly cuts away to flashbacks the moment an Easter egg is dropped or a character from an earlier film is brought back. It suffers from a weak baddie-Gabriel (Esai Morales) gets the worst end of the stick. When they even show Philip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian for just a few seconds, I couldn't help but think what an absolutely terrifying bad guy he was. Even Solomon Lane (a fantastic Sean Harris) was so badass. The writing renders Gabriel as a tier-2 baddie, only next to the AI. So, the scenes involving fail to deliver the terror (or the European upper-cut).It takes a good 75-80 minutes for the first MAJOR set-piece to get going, and without a doubt, Ethan Hunt's underwater expedition is superbly staged, performed, and captured. There is zero dialogue, just Hunt moving through claustrophobic spaces, trying not to get crushed under torpedos while trying to retrieve something important. This is a standout for me (as I'm also an underwater diver), and I was nearly on the edge of my seat. The final set-piece is also quite fun, but I couldn't help but wonder why Gabriel and his co-conspirator chose those old AF planes to flee (..just to add to our \"engine-blown\" worries, I guess?).The score (Max Aruj & Alfie Godfrey) is only used to amplify tension in some of the \"bigger\" scenes, but my pick for the best theme song rendition still goes to Michael Giacchino (from Part III). Fraser Taggart's visuals were astounding especially where they needed to be - under water and up in the air. Eddie Hamilton tries some quirky edit patterns to condense the exposition, but even then, the extent of a 3-hour long film is wholly felt. On the plus side, the film is consistently engaging, thanks to the wholesome presence of Simon Pegg, Hayley Atwell, and Greg Tarzan Davis.P. S. Pom Klementieff (as Paris) is my favourite in the team now!"

Without giving away much, Luther's singular contribution is too amazing to believe. He has a better brain than the AI god.The underwater claustrophobic scenes are awesome, the climax on the retro planes is good but i liked the train scene of dead reckoning better as it has better visual impact.But go for the action, nostalgia and of course, Tom Cruise. Special mention to Tramell Tillman. His character evoked the best response from the audience."

This movie lacked some twists & turns and was alot predictable the entire time.Althought this movie lacks some necessary elements but yet keeps you hooked until end coz of emotional scenes, in starting they give a summary & that kinda connects us giving Nostalgia.Apart from the underwater sequence/chapter which was indeed breathtaking, action scenes somewhere seemed to be a stepback as compared to other projects in this franchise.With diverse casting, irrespective to gender or race, this movie sets a classic example, Hannah really made an impression, whereas Angela seemed like she was born to president, then Pom as well had lesser but a good impact as well.Cudos to Tom & entire team for this epic ending they gave to Ethan Hunt's Legacy!"

The first half of the film is basically just getting from Point A to B, then explaining something about the entity OR talking about past events that happened prior these Film... there are many flashbacks. We realize really that these scenes were shot without a script. No character besides the Original three (you know which I mean) have a strong personality. Weak character-work, weak plot, weak story.But these Action scenes are one of the greatest you could ever experience. Your eyes just glue to the screen. From the part on where Hunt arrives on the Submarine, the film finally gets to do what it does best. The submarine sequence is one of the greatest things you could experience in a cinema. In a film, where people overly talk and explain things with extremely loud music and sound effects, they take off almost 20 minutes for just humming, bass, and breathing. A scaling masterpiece in every way...This is Made to be watched in IMAX. Especially the sequence."

It's hard to shake the feeling and perception that Ethan Hunt comes from the imagination of a self absorbed control freak. Our little group left the theatre having the best laugh at some of the outlandish absurdity of some of the scenes we witnessed......But ... Hey.... Don't let that spoil it for you, put all that to one side (?) and you'll enjoy the ride immensely !!"

          "content": "One of the worst movie in my opinion. All the other movies of the series were good but this one was below par in my opinion. Movie was so slow paced. Everything was expected. There was not thriller at all.There's no real urgency-everything unfolds at a sluggish pace, making the nearly three-hour runtime feel like a chore. What's worse is that nothing feels fresh. Every major twist is telegraphed well in advance, and the \"surprises\" fall completely flat. There's no suspense, no edge-of-your-seat moments-just a lot of noise and movement with no emotional payoff.Tom Cruise spends most of the film running and jumping, as always, but this time it feels meaningless. The action, while still technically polished, lacks soul. It's as if the filmmakers relied on stunts to distract from the lack of a coherent plot. There's barely any character development, and the central conflict-stopping an evil AI-is treated with such shallow storytelling that it never becomes compelling.The supporting cast, which has always been a strength of the series, is completely underutilized. Hayley Atwell, introduced with promise in Part One, is wasted here. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are mostly pushed aside. And the absence of Rebecca Ferguson's character, who added emotional depth in previous films, is deeply felt and never addressed in a meaningful way.Ultimately, Dead Reckoning Part Two feels like an empty spectacle. It has all the external markings of a Mission: Impossible film-fancy gadgets, globe-trotting, and Cruise doing death-defying stunts-but none of the heart, tension, or clever storytelling that made earlier entries stand out.For fans who have followed Ethan Hunt's journey over the years, this final chapter is a letdown. It's not just a disappointing ending-it's a reminder that even the most reliable franchises can lose their way. A slow, expected, and thrill-less ride with little reason to care."

But Ethan is also the person who is responsible for what may be the end of the Earth - and the end of cyberspace. I'm not kidding about that. Hunt alone bears that gargantuan burden. He also caused the problem so now is the only person on Earth who could actually save it. Why? Because most men would never be able to endure the pain and impossibility of what he needs to do except for Hunt, which of course, we know he will endure.The plot makes absolutely no sense at all as and as an excuse for several silly battles that occur with very high budget set pieces, which is what will impress most of a mindless audience. So many components of this production which takes itself so very seriously engage fully and completely into b-movie territory. Most of us were laughing at the self-love cruise provides for this film during the first hour, and how he is deified throughout the rest of the movie. He looks old and strange, and this this is a love letter to himself. None of it makes sense and the film Marches along for 2 and 1/2 hours with everyone. Sporting extremely grave faces of concern knowing that the fate of all existence lies in the hands of Ethan Hunt because he is just super amazing. Add in the silliness with ai and virtual reality, It has become mission preposterously funny. I know I'll get a lot of down votes by mindless fans, but this is seriously great stuff to get a few beers and laugh your head off with friends while mocking the screen."

As a fan of MI franchise I now think it peaked with MI: Fallout. Part II is continuing first part issues with bad writing, nonsensical plot, uninspiring action with a few standout sequences and dialogue bordering on satire/comedy. Action scenes and tricks are repetitive and nothing new or exciting. Movie feels sometimes as intentional parody on itself with unnecessary long prologue and constant flashbacks to previous series but even this does not work because of abysmally lazy story writing. For 400 mil budget you can come up with something much better. I hope Ethan Hunt is gone for good, if anything just to save his legacy from humiliation."

The earlier MI films were pretty rough, but the franchise grew on me with each installment. Fallout remains in my top 5 action movies of all time. Even Dead Reckoning was a blast and far better than I expected. But Final Reckoning? Sadly, it's a major letdown.What Went Wrong:Tries to be \"story-driven\" with a weak story. MI movies are known for intricate subplots with subtly integrated action like adrenaline-packed hand-to-hand combat, and stylish chase sequences. This film shifts focus to narrative and dialogue-but the story just isn't strong enough to carry that weight. It loses the core MI vibe.It feels... forced. With two-part finales, you'd expect a tightly planned arc (like Baahubali or Infinity War-Endgame). But this feels like a vague follow-up that was stitched together after Dead Reckoning, more to fulfill a contractual \"finale\" than to genuinely wrap things up.Underwhelming action. Sure, the action is decent-but it's not finale-level. This franchise has delivered iconic sequences in the past, so anything less feels like a step down. None of the action scenes blew me away.The \"finale\" ambiguity. There's no clear end to Ethan Hunt's story-no retirement, no closure. It leaves the door open for a possible 9th movie. So is this really the final reckoning? Doesn't seem like it.Unnatural connections to previous films. MI movies have always been loosely connected, but this one tries to force callbacks and resurface old characters who barely matter to the current plot. It feels like a patchwork fix rather than a well-crafted homage.What Worked:As always, the BGM slaps.A couple of action set pieces stand out, but they aren't enough to elevate the whole experience.Final Thoughts:This movie had the potential to be an emotionally satisfying, explosive finale. Instead, it gave us lazy writing and a boring screenplay dressed up with MI's signature stunts. It's not unwatchable-but it's painfully average.My Rankings for the MI Series:1. Fallout - 8.72. Dead Reckoning - 8.33. Rogue Nation - 7.84. MI 3 - 7.45. Ghost Protocol - 7.16. Final Reckoning - 6.77. MI 2 - 4.88. MI 1 - 4.5."

Tom Cruise, still clinging to the Ethan Hunt persona like a man refusing to admit his midlife crisis, delivers a performance that feels more like a parody than a lead role - a strangely ageless action hero with a god complex, solving global crises while defying logic, physics, and any sense of humility.The plot, if you can call it that, spirals into techno-babble and eye-roll-worthy coincidences, making suspension of disbelief not just a requirement but an act of self-deception. Add to that a cast seemingly assembled more from a diversity checklist than a casting call - clearly echoing the VP of Walt Disney's casting memos - and the film feels more engineered than inspired.And just when you think it couldn't get more bloated, it ends without really ending - a lazy setup for another sequel rather than a satisfying conclusion. There's entertainment buried somewhere beneath the bombast, but not enough to justify the runtime or the self-importance. Two stars for the effort, but this mission should have been declined."

This time the director Christopher McQuarrie thought of making a Nolan-type movie but utterly failed. I am not sure what McQuarrie and Cruise were trying to accomplish. Only the fighting scene in the air between Ethan Hunt and Gabriel and underwater scene of Ethan Hunt are breathtaking. This last movie of the MI franchise is a big let down."

He was there!However, even with all of the clumsy exposition, I still found myself completely lost for much of the time, such is the confusing, badly-written techno-babble tosh that passes for a script on this occasion. I guess this mightn't have been so bad had there been plenty of well-choreographed thrills and spills along the way, but The Final Reckoning is also light on edge-of-the-seat action in comparison with earlier entries in the series - for a three hour film, the number of exciting scenes is very disappointing: we get a brief fight in a wooden cabin, a protracted sequence inside a flooded, wrecked Russian submarine that is surprisingly lacking in tension, and then it's a long slog to the airborne finalé, which is impressively handled but utterly preposterous.I realise that ridiculous plot twists, incomprehensible high-tech twaddle and crazy stunts have always been a part of the franchise, but in this particular outing, everything is so far-fetched and improbable (Hunt survives hypothermia and the bends with no ill effect and everyone seems to know how to defuse a nuclear bomb) that it almost feels like a parody, right down to the relieved character at the end saying 'He made it... he actually made it!', or some such clichéd garbage.3.5/10 generously rounded up to 4 for IMDb. If this is the end of the franchise, it's not a great way to go out."

Directed with masterful precision and packed with jaw-dropping sequences, the film delivers everything fans could hope for-and more.From the opening scene to the final frame, the pacing is flawless. There isn't a single dull moment. Every beat moves the story forward, balancing action and emotion with remarkable finesse. The narrative never drags, yet it gives enough time for viewers to feel the weight of the characters' decisions. Each set piece is meticulously placed to raise the stakes, building up to a powerful, emotionally charged climax.The ending is especially noteworthy-not just for its cinematic grandeur, but for the emotional punch it packs. It feels like the perfect culmination of Ethan Hunt's journey so far. It's satisfying, thought-provoking, and leaves the audience with a sense of closure while still teasing what's to come. It's clear that every choice in the finale was made with care and respect for the character's legacy.The music deserves special mention. Lorne Balfe's score intensifies the suspense, amplifies the emotion, and makes the action sequences even more thrilling. The iconic theme is used creatively throughout, echoing Ethan's internal struggles and triumphs. Music, here, isn't just background-it's a storytelling tool, seamlessly integrated into every moment.One of the most surprising elements of the film is its emotional depth. While the franchise has always flirted with themes of loyalty and sacrifice, Dead Reckoning digs deeper. Ethan's choices carry real consequences, and the emotional arcs of supporting characters are given genuine weight. These moments of vulnerability make the action even more impactful, as viewers are reminded of the human cost behind the spectacle.Speaking of spectacle, the stunts are out of this world. Tom Cruise once again proves why he's the gold standard in action cinema. The practical effects, the real locations, and Cruise's unwavering commitment to authenticity make the action feel visceral and thrilling. From death-defying jumps to intense hand-to-hand combat, each stunt feels fresh, dangerous, and utterly exhilarating.But beyond the explosions and espionage, this film is a heartfelt tribute to Ethan Hunt-a man who has risked everything to do what's right. The script acknowledges his growth, his pain, and his unwavering sense of duty. It's a respectful, poignant portrayal of a character who has become an icon.Tom Cruise is simply brilliant. He delivers a performance full of nuance, energy, and emotion. Whether he's sprinting across rooftops or confronting inner demons, Cruise commands every frame. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances that elevate the film's emotional stakes and camaraderie.In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning is more than just an action film-it's a cinematic event. With perfect pacing, a gripping ending, powerful music, emotional storytelling, breathtaking stunts, and a heartfelt tribute to a beloved hero, this is easily one of the best entries in the franchise. A must-watch."

          "content": "Huge fan of the series, but the final two films left me utterly disappointed.The writing has become on the nose, cliché and massively overwritten and the plot stumbles along with: this happens, then this happens, like a child telling a clunky story.It doesn't make you feel anything, especially because every five seconds someone adds: 'everything has led to this...'Of course the stunts are amazing, but why would we care unless we care about the characters and the story?Montages and cameos try to tell you relentlessly about why you should care, but they weigh the story down so much, it feels like watching trailers for other movies while in this one.Christopher McQuarrie has delivered some wonderful scripts and movies in the past, but somehow he's managed to turn in a piece of work that's both overwritten and undercooked. Could have done with a really good script editor and maybe a college student studying film to explain why the stakes have become non-existent.I care deeply about this series, but I can say I'll never watch these final two again."

A rumor said that Ethan goes to a villain in the alternative (the original) story. True or not, I prefer it to this; Ethan and all the staff abuse Mission Impossible.There used to be fabulous, exciting car chase, motorcycle chase, a city tour, disco and nightclub, opera or concert, and a little twist of fellows. Those are what I think the concept of Mission Impossible itself and the Impossible Mission Force is going to solve it.In this movie, all of them are sitting on a chair in a dark cave or tunnels. Explaining to us what is happening and who is going to die. And Ethan is out there for his glee sky or underwater walk.Nothing fancy, or bright scene to make my heart beat fast. Especially, the roles for Erika and Paris and the way they act are very disappointed. Erika tuned into the President of the United States from the CIA vice-president. Since she appeared in the series, all she could do is to abuse authority for nonsense. Paris speaks nothing useful or does anything helpful, compared to the former extraordinary agent Ilsa Faust.And no idea who is fighting against what? This lacks many things, many things important and had them in the previous episodes except M: I 2. See no evil."

          "content": "What I find most spectacular in \"The Final Reckoning\" is how poor the writing is. Most blockbusters don't care that much about their actual plot, but they rarely fall as low as this new \"Mission Impossible\". Very little makes sense, while some of the action scenes provoked giggles in the (small) audience in my theater (we are told repeatedly that Ethan will need special equipment for his deep dive, until he doesn't).The villain (if that's what Daniel is) is barely present and just a smirking caricature. They tried to give him a backstory in the previous film but that's all forgotten now, no personal animosity with our hero, just a guy that needs to be caught. No info on who bankrolls him now, who are the guys working for him, how they keep popping up from nowhere, etc. They could at least have made him into the leader of the cult around the AI, for example, to tie in a few loose ends. But clearly nobody cares here.And they're wrong not to care: \"Mission Impossible\" has also been enjoyed by folks around the world for its twists and turns, manipulations and setups, not just for the action. There's none of that here, which is a mistake. Average audiences can only take so much action before their attention will drift away.The A. I. itself is incredibly wasted and only features in one tiny scene... We are told it now controls \"cyberspace\" (who still uses that word in 2025, seriously??), but everyone can safely travel and do their usual routine as though nothing were the matter. The first film established some (vague) kind of digital manipulation, but this has all disappeared from the new film.In reality \"The Final Reckoning\" feels like an overlong third act that has been stretched into an actual feature film. That's not, I think, the best way of enticing audiences into theaters, especially if you're trying to sell this flick as Cruise's last one (who seriously believes that?)."

In here there's a 2 hour entry like a \"prelude\" for Tom Cruise final act that is let me say SPECTACULAR. So the real movie starts at 1 hour and 45 min. For me there was no real tension. Whatever the writing though to pinpoint the stakes was flooded with constant whispering, dramatic if not hilarious slow motion and character placements that felt like a L'Oréal\nCommercial.Tom Cruise is the best of what he does. I have lots of respect for the man and his input to cinema. For me this entry is a bit of a downer, not real story. Of u could see the first one skip 1 hour and 45 min of the second one and watch the remaining hour as a 3rd act will make a fantastic movie of 3 and a half hours long. Like I said to much planning and explaining, poor direction choices.Felt more like a legacy tribute to the job that Tom Cruise has put in this movies than a sequel conclusion. The last hour of the movie a 10. The first 1 hour and 45 easily a satire. They were heaps of different ways to make it better."

However, the movie feels a bit lengthy, and the story lacks that special spark to truly stand out. There's a noticeable impatience in the direction, with some sequences feeling rushed while others drag unnecessarily. Since Avengers: Infinity War, no action thriller has managed to leave a lasting impression on me, and unfortunately, Mission Impossible - The Final Reckoning is no exception. The action is thrilling in parts, but the emotional depth and narrative strength fall short. The film tries to raise stakes but struggles to keep the tension consistent. Overall, it's a decent watch for franchise fans, but I expected more."

It is a mostly meandering process of trying to fit in as many characters as possible while retreading old plots. This is enhanced by the overly long run time. One sequence which is supposed to be suspenseful just ends up dragging on and on. The rest of the action and set pieces are, again, adequate though a number of fake out deaths cheapen some of the impact. As for the movie's billing as the \"final\" installment of the series; it falls well short. The audience has sat through 7 movies over 30 years with these characters only to receive an ending not overly different from 3-4 of the other movies in the series. Disappointing."

          "content": "Since the previous installment, I've had a feeling that the narrative structure from Dead Reckoning to Dead Reckoning Part One was heavily influenced by Tom Clancy's The Hunt for Red October and The Sum of All Fears. Additionally, elements of the 1964 film Fail Safe are also present. That film depicted a scenario where a technical glitch led the U. S. military to mistakenly bomb Moscow with a nuclear weapon, prompting the Soviet Union to retaliate with a nuclear strike. To prevent a full-scale nuclear war, the U. S. President, speaking to the Soviet Premier via hotline, chose to sacrifice New York City to demonstrate America's sincerity in not pursuing further conflict.Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One integrates plot elements from all of these films. It features a Russian stealth submarine, global panic over nuclear launch capabilities, and even a storyline involving the destruction of a domestic city to reassure foreign powers and prevent a world war.It's clear that this spy franchise, born during the Cold War, still cannot escape the looming fear of nuclear war, even after eight film installments in the 21st century. In the tense geopolitical climate of the post-pandemic 2020s, this pervasive fear resonates even more deeply with audiences.Narratively, Dead Reckoning Part One also reminds me of the interwoven storytelling used in The Dark Knight.The plot is quite complex. Ethan Hunt holds a key everyone is after. An autonomous AI entity called \"The Entity,\" bent on global annihilation, wants him to use the key to access and preserve its source code in an underground bunker-so it can survive post-nuclear devastation. Meanwhile, Gabriel, a former enemy from the previous film who was \"fired\" by the Entity, seeks to regain control over it. The U. S. President also wants the key to save the world from destruction. The film reintroduces characters from earlier installments, expanding the \"Mission: Impossible Universe\": the computer expert from the first film, who was reassigned to Alaska for over 30 years after Ethan stole the NOC list; the son of Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight in the first film), now an agent driven by personal vendetta against Ethan; and the revelation that Ethan's past missions indirectly or directly contributed to the creation of the Entity. The film also explores the President's admiration for Ethan's past achievements, along with recognition from the captain of the USS George H. W. Bush and a nuclear submarine commander. These figures place their trust in Ethan and his team to carry out a \"mission impossible\" to save the world. (This storyline is nearly a direct lift from The Hunt for Red October, featuring Jack Ryan.)Director Christopher McQuarrie's approach is to let multiple characters discuss the same issue, explaining to the audience-line by line-what's happening and what must be done. Initially, the mission is complicated by jargon, but it always boils down to Ethan Hunt needing to take direct action. This culminates in Tom Cruise performing extreme stunts, notably retrieving the source code from a submerged submarine and fighting the villain on top of a plane in the final sequence.From a narrative standpoint, McQuarrie does a great job. Despite being 2 hours and 49 minutes long, I never felt the story was dragging. The pacing was well executed.However, despite its grand scale and swift pace, Dead Reckoning Part One clearly gives off a sense of routine. This feeling was already present in Dead Reckoning, the previous installment. Every Tom Cruise-led Mission: Impossible film now feels like a lengthy episode of The Adventures of Tom, regardless of the character he plays. It's all about Tom Cruise performing stunts and charming women. The formula has become so fixed that the plot alone can no longer maintain immersion-I don't feel like I'm watching a movie, but rather watching a superstar do his thing.The fatigue in Dead Reckoning Part One is perhaps even more noticeable than in its predecessor. Take the stunt sequences: the previous film had Cruise jumping off a cliff, presented with long shots and wide angles to emphasize the solitary act. Though we know he'll be fine, it's still impressive. But in Part One, both the submarine escape and the plane fight use mostly medium shots and close-ups, which makes them feel less grand in scale. During the submarine escape scene, when Ethan is rescued by the female lead, McQuarrie opts for multiple blended close-ups, perhaps trying to show romantic tension between Ethan and Grace. However, Hayley Atwell's presence pales compared to Rebecca Ferguson's character, who exited in the last film. While Grace is given moments of fear and crisis due to language barriers, it doesn't add much emotional weight. Most characters, apart from Tom Cruise, feel like they're just going through the motions. Even Simon Pegg, who usually steals scenes, feels mechanical. Ving Rhames' character makes a major sacrifice, but it doesn't carry enough emotional power.Overall, Dead Reckoning Part One is grand in scope, but weaker in emotional depth compared to its predecessor. Although several new characters are introduced, they fail to elicit real empathy. In the end, we're just watching another Tom Cruise solo adventure. But with the eighth film in this franchise, even that is starting to wear thin. The recurring reference to \"May 22, 1996\"-the release date of the first Mission: Impossible-feels like emotional blackmail, especially when characters read the message and become visibly moved.Though the film doesn't conclude Ethan Hunt's story, it ends with a silent farewell-characters parting with just looks of trust and friendship, suggesting an open ending. But personally, I feel it may be time for Tom Cruise to let go. The Mission: Impossible universe can continue, but perhaps it's time for Ethan Hunt to finally retire."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning marks the climactic end of a franchise that has redefined action cinema over the last three decades. Helmed once again by Christopher McQuarrie and headlined by the ever-committed Tom Cruise, this final installment delivers everything longtime fans have come to love-pulse-pounding action, complex espionage, emotional stakes-and elevates it further with introspection, high-concept tension, and a satisfying sense of closure.Picking up directly after the events of Dead Reckoning Part One, The Final Reckoning thrusts Ethan Hunt and his team into their most daunting mission yet. The Entity-a rogue artificial intelligence that has slipped beyond human control-is manipulating global systems, threatening to unravel world powers and rewrite the balance of power. As governments scramble to either destroy or capture this digital ghost, Ethan is forced to operate in the shadows, racing against time to find the last piece of the key that can shut the Entity down for good.What sets this film apart is its balance between relentless action and philosophical depth. Unlike previous entries where the threats were physical or political, here the antagonist is intangible yet omnipresent. The Entity is faceless, invisible, and terrifyingly plausible, embodying fears of unchecked technology and lost control. McQuarrie smartly explores these themes while keeping the narrative grounded in the emotional core of Ethan's journey.Tom Cruise delivers a powerful performance, not just physically (though his stunt work continues to amaze), but emotionally. Ethan is more vulnerable here than ever before. He's a man burdened by years of sacrifice, haunted by the people he couldn't save, and now forced to choose between the mission and his humanity. There's a weight to his decisions, a sense that every step forward costs him a piece of himself. Cruise taps into that weariness while still radiating the determination and moral clarity that define Ethan Hunt.The returning ensemble cast shines as always. Simon Pegg's Benji and Ving Rhames' Luther provide not only technical support and comic relief, but emotional grounding. Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust remains a standout-her relationship with Ethan is both complex and deeply felt. New characters are introduced as well, including a coldly calculating former IMF agent turned antagonist, Gabriel Stone, who knows Ethan's tactics inside and out. His presence adds a personal, psychological edge to the conflict, heightening the stakes.The action sequences are, as expected, extraordinary. From a snowbound train sabotage to a zero-gravity infiltration of a high-security orbital data relay, the stunts are both innovative and grounded in practical effects, with Cruise pushing the limits of physical endurance. These scenes aren't just spectacle-they're tightly woven into the plot, driving the story forward with each set piece."

It's evolved since the 1996 original, but that's the fun of the series. These movies take the espionage genre then sprint out of a building, dive out of a plane and land on a highway while enemies give chase. The Mission Franchise has become the blueprint for how to excel at telling a story through its massive stunt sequences and this eighth (and final?) film aces what this series does best. Director McQuarrie does a spectacular job of creating tension throughout, setting the stakes right at the top of the film and never letting up. His and Tom Cruise's commitment to the practical stunts really sets these films apart from any other in the genre. The Final Reckoning feels like it's tying a bow on the Mission movies by tying it deeply to the other entries and if that's the case, I'm okay with it. This film has a sense of dread hanging over it, that I'm not sure another Mission could top. I do miss the humor from the previous films, but it would be out of place in this \"two minutes to midnight\" story. The Plane sequence in the finale is pure adrenaline and kept me literally on the edge of my seat. I had an amazing time watching this in the theater. A true class act in how to build tension, thrill the audience and execute stunts. 8/10."

As in the previous instalment, the main antagonist is humanity's ultimate boss, artificial intelligence. MI:8 is certainly less far-sightedly prophetic than, for example, Terminator 40 years ago, the problem is now just around the corner, but at least as dramatic. Drama is again the general leitmotif of the plot. The choice between Armageddon or absolute Armageddon, that's as good as it gets. After 30 years, there's a final atmosphere in many respects, not least because Tom Cruise is now noticeably ageing. Even the unfavourable long hairstyle doesn't change that. Old comrades-in-arms, the indispensable team, lots of cosy flashbacks, the usual plan, the usual stumbling blocks. Plus apparently a quota of women, er, female power. A mission that is doomed to fail? Not a spoiler, but what is? The journey is the goal here, and it feels choreographed like a ballet. A flaw? Probably, but also the reason for not a minute of boredom. The question of realism is put aside at the start of the film anyway. In return, you're rewarded with superlatives that are no longer to be expected, as well as a queasy feeling when you take the background story out of the cinema. And the moral of the story? Use pen and paper!"

SPOILERS to follow.I did recently re-watch MI 1 and remembered that it was just as much about the mystery, plot twists and story as it was about the action.In the end this is not a bad Mission movie, but it is a bad movie due to being way too formulaic. Even bringing back the mi1 character felt formulaic.I really enjoyed dead reckoning and was genuinely sad when Rebecca Fergusson son's character died.With this one it was so much about the \"podkova\" , \"the poison\", the nukes and the action, that the characters served as means to get to the next set piece and not the heart of the story, which left me disappointed.At least since MI5 we had the love story angle, which \"died\" in dead reckoning. There is none of that here, just a weird semi-colleagual connection to Hayley Atwell's character.True that we get the friendship angle hitting hard due to Luther's untimely demise, but come on, they made him sick, so it wouldn't matter as much and quickly added another member to the team.As for the action, it really overstayed it's welcome.The whole submarine dive for example - search, escape and survival felt unnecessarily complicated and oversimplified at the same time.Do you really expect me to believe that you can navigate through a sunken Russian sub without having seen the plans for one or doing any real preparation.As a whole they really backed themselves into a corner with this Ai story, making it feel more like a Bond than a Mission movie. Saving the world or controlling an Ai is not what I expect from a MI, but rather infiltrating, extracting and finessing, and an occasional jump, car chase and dive.Probably I will rewatch it, but I am hoping for a new, fresh beginning."

          "content": "The Mission Impossible series comes to a memorable end with this eighth installment (although who knows if Tom Cruise doesn't have another one up his sleeve - he's still incredibly fit ;)).I've been a huge fan of this action series since the very beginning and watched the previous installment, \"Dead Reckoning\", about seven times, so I remembered well what had happened and where it left off.Nevertheless, it takes almost an hour for the sequel to pick up where the first part left off after a two-year wait. A lot has happened in that time, and much of it is explained in flashbacks, referencing even the very first and third parts of the saga. But was all that really necessary to complete the saga?The story about an artificial intelligence that first seizes all existing nuclear weapons and then aims to destroy humanity is indeed a timely topic, but the plot is quite confusing. I had some trouble following the plot and understanding the sequence of events during the first hour (but hey, maybe I'm just overthinking it). Looking back, I found this first hour somewhat lengthy and downright unexciting. Only after the 60-minute mark does the actual mission resume, and the action - the kind we know and love - kicks into gear. Only then does the audience finally get what they came for.Unfortunately, in this part, we also have to say goodbye to a beloved character we've known since the very first film. Dramatically, it makes sense, but it's not entirely convincing. In the last movie, Luther was healthy - suddenly he's sick - yet it's never explained why. His work, known as the \"poison pill,\" is ultimately what can shut down the AI. But even here, I wondered: was his sacrifice really necessary?Back in \"Dead Reckoning\", I already had a hard time accepting that Ilsa had really died and secretly hoped she might not be gone after all. She and Ethan had been through so many missions together after Rogue Nation and Fallout, and they had visibly grown emotionally closer. Grace, on the other hand, had made life and the mission difficult for Ethan, and they barely knew each other. So it was puzzling that he was forced to choose between the two in the end.All in all, \"The Final Reckoning\" is still a solid high-paced action movie with a mission that, like all the previous ones, seems impossible - and yet isn't. I would have accepted it if Ethan had died, but I'm even more relieved that he survived - and with that, the hope for another sequel remains. Hope dies last, right?Compared to Part 7 (which becomes especially clear if you watch both films back-to-back), this one loses a bit of its shine and glory and doesn't fully convince. Part 7 had many more great action sequences, left no room for doubt in the audience's mind, and delivered overwhelmingly convincing action entertainment from start to finish. \"Final Reckoning\" unfortunately couldn't fully match that and has lost some speed, so it has to settle for a lower position."

I don't understand how McQuarrie could have thought, \"Yeah, this will fly.\" It's an insult to the audience's intelligence, but oh well... There are other inconsistencies, like in the cave scene, but that one is more forgivable-similar to scenes from the previous films. But the submarine scene? That one just doesn't work at all. It's pure nonsense. Thankfully, it doesn't ruin the movie."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is the latest and eighth film in the series. It is once again partly directed, co-written, and produced by Christopher McQuarrie, who also directed the previous three Mission: Impossible films.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is still trying to stop the AI Entity before it gains too much access to the online world and starts posing a threat to humanity. Due to the level of access the Entity already has, Ethan finds it hard to trust new people during his mission. As a result, he has to rely on a few familiar faces within and outside the IMF to complete this mission.This new Mission: Impossible film continues the story from the previous installment, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (2023). Although it serves as a kind of second part to the same story, a considerable amount of time is still spent on explanatory moments. As a result, the beginning of the film can feel a bit slow-like having to sit through theory before getting to the practical part. The film also includes some flashbacks from the previous seven films, aiming to tie them together more as a coherent series. However, since most of the earlier films were relatively standalone apart from a few recurring characters, this effort may come off as a bit forced.That said, you don't need to have seen all seven previous films to understand this new installment. Watching the seventh film could be helpful, though, as this one continues many of its plot points. For long-time fans, seeing moments from past films again can be a nice touch.This is likely the final Mission: Impossible film featuring these characters and actors. In the future, the series could be revived with a new cast.Like its predecessors, this film was shot on real locations, which are beautifully captured and contribute to the realism. Tom Cruise once again performs his own stunts, just as he has in previous films. Some situations he finds himself in-like hanging from a flying plane or being underwater with limited oxygen-are reminiscent of earlier films. This time, however, he opted to go even bigger and more dangerous, taking more risks to deliver greater excitement and entertainment for the audience. That alone might make the slow start worth sitting through.In addition to Tom Cruise, other familiar faces also return, though at times there are perhaps too many characters involved. While the film generally balances them well, not every character feels essential, and the time spent on some of them can come across as unnecessary. With fewer characters, flashbacks, and exposition, this nearly three-hour-long film could have been shorter-and possibly avoided some of its more sluggish moments."

Without a basic grasp of what the series is about - and more importantly, without having seen Part 7 (which is essentially the first half of this finale) - you'll be utterly lost. Honestly, Part 7 and 8 could have easily been merged into one tighter, albeit longer, action movie.Mission: Impossible 8 feels like a loosely connected string of action scenes, some of which are indeed visually stunning - though narratively thin. Whether Tom Cruise really did all the stunts himself is anyone's guess at this point - it's getting harder to believe. And while his physical commitment is still impressive, it's hard to ignore that age is catching up with him. You also start to notice that his facial expressions seem to come in just two flavours these days.The plot feels overstuffed, as if the writers didn't quite know what else to throw in, and hoped sheer volume would do the trick. Some lines of dialogue are painfully outdated - like when a supposedly strong, intelligent woman whispers, \"Ethan, only you can save the world... who else if not you?\" Even as an ageing white bloke, I found myself wincing.There are some genuinely nice callbacks to earlier instalments - including the welcome return of Rolf Saxon - which long-time fans will surely appreciate. And to be fair, the cast includes several strong performers from other top-tier productions.For die-hard fans of the franchise who must see this (hopefully final) entry, it's probably a must-watch. For everyone else - there are certainly far better action films out there right now."

          "content": "With a reported budget somewhere in the vicinity of $300-$400 million, no one could accuse the final (with what I suspect should come with a very big ?) Mission: Impossible film from resting on its laurels with collaborative partners Tom Cruise and his directing buddy Christopher McQuarrie giving audiences more of what they've come to expect from one of Hollywood's most impressively consistent brands that started out with a bang all the way back in 1996.Working together on the series since 2015's Rogue Nation and delivering what is considered the best film in the franchise with 2018's Fallout entry, McQuarrie and Cruise have set themselves a significantly high bar for entertainment and expectations that wasn't quite met commercially with 2023's Covid-19 affected Dead Reckoning and isn't reached with this close to 3 hour epic that provides much in the way of high class spectacle and popcorn munching fun but also feels overly long in the tooth and devoid of early spark, that makes this closing statement on the Ethan Hunt world an enjoyable one without being an overly memorable one.Following on directly from the events of Dead Reckoning, Final Reckoning takes its time to get going as we pay respects to past occurrences dating all the way back to Hunt's first foray into the world of the IMF while also setting in motion the key elements of this journeys plot, that basically sees the world teetering on the edge of implosion with a dangerous A. I system wrecking havoc across the globe with only Hunt and his ever willing team of compatriots able to potentially save the day.Hoping to prove to us for an eighth time that these missions are in fact possible, Cruise's Hunt must traverse the lonely late night streets of London, negotiate with presidents, go for some ice cold dips in the ocean and enjoy a precarious joy ride in the skies if he is to overcome the odds and conquer evil for those he will never know yet while Cruise is ever willing at the age of 62, there's something slightly underwhelming about much of Final Reckoning's first 90 or so minutes that only really begin to reach the levels we have become accustomed too around the half-way mark, making this the type of big screen experience you're likely to ever only seek out for one go around.It's absolutely the equivalent of first world problems in a viewing manner when you can sit back and not be overcome with joy and wow-factor by a team so committed to providing large-scale spectacle and amusement but when you take the time and consider what the first part of Final Reckoning entails, you can't help but escape the feeling Cruise and McQuarrie overestimated the work they were doing, with Final Reckoning likely to have benefited greatly from stronger early set-pieces, less heavy-handed dialogue and a tighter edit to enhance the overall feeling of the film weighed up as a whole.There's still no denying that when the film hits its marks it hits as well as any other big budget blockbuster could muster, a thrilling final stretch will make you sit back with a giant smile on your face while Cruise's unmatched commitment to his role as an entertainer and some emotionally charged character movements will work well for the series long-term fans but there's an underlying sense that Final Reckoning is slightly on the wrong side of self-indulgence and mis-guided confidence, something that wasn't such a factor in the series peaks of entries 3 - 7.If Final Reckoning does indeed end up being the final bow for Cruise and his Impossible gang we can be thankful for the quality years of viewing experiences we've been given courtesy of their pride in providing cinema fans a reason to celebrate the big screen blockbuster experience and while this \"farewell\" doesn't end with a mighty bang, there's still enough reason for fans to support one last go around the sun for one of film histories most surprisingly consistent and likable properties.Final Say -Unable to overcome its more indulgent nature in all instances, if you can suspend your disbelief sufficiently Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is still top quality Hollywood filmmaking that might not match the best of its namesakes but still gives us plenty to enjoy along its way to a breath-taking final stretch.3 1/2 open ocean Uber's out of 5."

He sets the benchmark so high it seems impossible to overcome.2 scenes submarine and the plane chase are the only cheers for the action lovers. Submarine scene is more like a tense drama rather than action.Tense nuclear situation was engaging.Cons: gloomy music! Could have been better as previous films also concentrated on music singles and iconic songs associated with the franchise.Linking from the first part, well 30 yrs in the making looks bit odd yet functional.Sad reminders after every few minutes that you are watching the finale rather than forwarding the film.Too slow at the start, too much narration esp in the first half, it could be cut short by 20 mins.Summary: if you are showing the global situation then Hollywood must also consider the point of views of other countries and few scenes from its leaders or commanders could have really make it more realistic and more engaging.There could be chase from different special ops teams from other countries which would light up the final impossible task."

That said... was this an unintended parody?Let's be honest: this franchise probably wasn't meant to last this long. What started in the '90s as a sleek spy reboot has mutated into a bloated, over-serious epic that takes itself far too seriously. 'The Final Reckoning' is, to me, the weakest entry yet.Where to begin? It's sluggish. We're talking nearly three hours of globe-trotting, Botox grimacing, and endless exposition. Why so much talking? We're not cracking Cold War codes here - just chasing yet another all-powerful AI (how timely), which, by the way, genuinely feels like it wrote this script itself.And Tom Cruise... bless him. But he's doing everything he can not to admit he's ageing, even as the camera gently tries to crop out the toll of gravity. We've reached the point where Ethan Hunt no longer runs to save the world - he runs to outrun time itself.Special shoutout to the laughably lazy choice of submarine name: Losharik. As a Russian speaker, this was pure comedy. No one in the writers' room even googled it, did they? Love that for them.Yes, there are a couple of solid action scenes, but they're strung together by dialogue-heavy filler and emotional arcs that never land. It's like the film is asking for a standing ovation it hasn't earned. What happened to the fun? The absurd but self-aware thrills? Now it's all heavy-handed messaging, slow zooms, and moral crises.This franchise didn't age well. It should have ended two films ago - maybe even four. As a send-off, 'The Final Reckoning' feels more like a mercy killing disguised as a tribute."

Cruise's commitment to practical effects and daring sequences-especially the motorcycle cliff jump-elevates the spectacle.

I went to see this with my dad; he's younger than Tom Cruise, and his addition to the review is that his shoulder started hurting just from watching what Tom does on screen.The Mission: Impossible franchise has become one of my favorites over the last two decades. Ever since Ghost Protocol, the series has been on a consistent streak, delivering some of the best spy films packed with thrilling action and phenomenal stunt work. These are movies made to be experienced on the big screen.Final Reckoning ties together some threads from earlier installments, but it does so in a way that doesn't require you to have seen all of them, except maybe the previous film. You'll still be able to follow the story and enjoy the ride.For some viewers, the high level of suspension of disbelief might be a hurdle. But for me, if anyone can make the impossible feel possible, it's Tom Cruise.There are multiple sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. The submarine scene had me gripped with tension. It was one of those scenes where you don't even realize you're holding your breath, and it had me completely nailed to my seat. The biplane sequence was another highlight: beautifully performed, and it honestly (over)delivered on expectations.Mission: Impossible movies don't need to try hard to win me over, but they always go the extra mile, and it shows. I'll probably be catching this one again before its theatrical run ends."

It's a bit confusing the concepts just a little bit erratic and all over the shop. Some scenes didn't make sense. It's like the logistics of where we're going and where they needed to be all of a sudden, they were there.The big ending action with the aircraft was good just wasn't as believable and his impressive as the first half the previous movie my opinion but it seem to be a bit of a drag for me."

This was an all right conclusion, but I think it's one of the weaker movies in the franchise. The story is just okay, like in most of these movies (wich is fine, since we're here for the action), but even the action can feel a little underwhelming when compared to the previous movies. The action itself isn't necesserally the problem, but I think there should be more of it. I was often bored in between the action scenes. I actually kind of liked the political side of the movie, but most of the side characters were pretty bland (in my opinion), and I thought it was very predictable, especially the second half of the movie, wich I thought dragged on for way too long.Overall, it's a fun enough time, and you should definitely see it if you're a fan of the franchise, but don't go in expecting the best Mission Impossible movie, it's not."

E. M. Song) through nuclear weapons.That would have been bad enough, but this edition also introduces the viewer to \"Podcova\" and Luther's magical \"Poison Pill\".The later has Ethan going to enormous lengths to retrieve it, when he could have saved us all the heartache by accepting the damn thing from Luther in the first place, but then we wouldn't have this fantastical story that defies gravity, logic, physics and every other law known to man.The saviour of \"Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning\" are some spectacular action sequences.The stunts are ridiculous and that's why it's called Mission Impossible...if it was easy anyone could do it.If James Bond and Keystone Cops had a love child it would be \"MI:TFR\".At one talky point in a boring script Nick Offerman as General Sidney states, \"We are in the entity's reality now!\".I'm not kidding.Somehow the Parks & Rec star keeps a straight face, just before he dies after taking a bullet to his chesty medals.Watch out for: a touch of horror movie that reminded me of \"Lord of the Flies\" where the boys find the pilot.In \"MI:TFR\" we meet the crew of the submarine that torpedoed itself and sank to the ocean floor.Submarine footage is worth price of admission alone and makes up for some of the bad science, like free diving at 300 plus feet in arctic waters without a pressure suit or even a mask, but that's ok because they bought an inflatable decompression chamber on line that fits you and your lover...apparently.Then again any excuse for Tom to show off his naked torso and countless hours spent in a gym.Just shy of 3 hours this is the longest runtime in the history of this franchise, so sit back get comfortable in Gold Class and order something expensive because you deserve it for making it through this marathon.MI has always had a sense of Scooby Doo mystery machine about with the fake faces and ludicrous bombs and this last instalment is no exception.\"Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning\" maybe the end of these epic adventures, yet it doesn't feel like we've seen the last of Ethan and his band of merry men and women.We who live in the shadows can only look on in awe as MI comes to a grinding halt like a freight train that's run out track."

Our protagonist Ethan Hunt and his merry band of IMF members ( Benji, Grace, Paris & Co.) have to race against time to locate him and stop a rogue AI software known as \"The Entity\" from destroying the world.The first half might seem a tad bit slow as Ethan and team try to locate the sunken Russian submarine Sevastopol which holds the original source code required to stop the Entity . The first hour, weighed down by flashbacks, appears to stall the momentum rather than building it.The second half is where the real action starts with Tom cruise performing death defying stunts , which sometimes seem way over the top, but highly entertaining ... The dog fight with Gabriel in the climax being the highlight of the film.However what was missing in it was the adrenaline rush inducing iconic MI BGM playing while our hero rescues the world from annihilation..i was actually praying for the music to start.. but alas it never did and so did the impact of this iconic scene !! 😭Also the absence of a human antagonist lessened the tension. Replacing the flesh and blood villain with an all-powerful Rogue AI software might seem a let down as the plot seems similar to the Terminator franchise- something that we have seen many many times.Visually, the film is polished & pleasing to the eye. But grandeur alone isn't enough. As the final chapter of a franchise known for pushing boundaries. I felt the makers played it safe, depriving the audiences of an out of a box kind of a climax ,as seen in some of the previous films in the franchise.Was this film good .. yeah definitely!!Was this the best one churned out by the franchise... Definitely not ... Unfortunately 😔Going with 3/5 for this one .. adios 🙂!!#sanjuzzreviews #MissionImpossibleTheFinalReckoning\n#TomCruise #hayleyatwell #SimonPegg #VingRhames #moviereview #filmreview."

However, I found myself wishing for more hand-to-hand combat scenes, which have always been a highlight of the franchise.Assuming this is indeed the final installment, I believe the story could have taken a bolder emotional turn. Ethan sacrificing himself after saving the world, perhaps falling from the airplane after the final fight, would have added a deeper emotional impact and provided a powerful end to his journey.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. While it may not surpass some of its predecessors, Final Reckoning is still a solid and satisfying conclusion to the Mission: Impossible saga."

          "content": "Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning left us with a tantalising cliff hanger. The world was on the edge of AI induced armageddon, and only Ethan Hunt possessed the key to potentially save humanity. Quite the springboard for The Final Reckoning, which picks up these threads and ties them in a satisfying final reckoning indeed.I won't go into many specifics of the story, but it will certainly prove satisfying to long time fans of the franchise. A smorgasbord of familiar faces light up the screen with a few call backs to earlier instalments in the franchise. The good thing is they don't feel like awkward fan service, and work well in the context of the story. What this film also does really well is work almost as a standalone film. I think if you've never seen a Mission film before, you could rock up the cinema and have a good time watching this without being particularly lost. The stakes and the allegiances are all spelled out pretty clearly. I do think the film is maybe a tad too long for what is it. The story is fun and engaging and full of great action, but it is maybe dragged out a touch too long. This never really stops it being a good time though.As mentioned, the film is full of great action and the stunts on display here are marvellous. The trailer displays the big one where Cruise hangs off a biplane, and this lives up to the hype. Another sequence inside a submarine is expertly shot, eeking every ounce of tension out of the scenario. If I was being overly critical I would say the film was lacking in combat work. A few more hand to hand combat scenarios would have been fun as I always like those, and there have been some great ones in the franchise before. Overall though, what is presented on the screen in fantastic in terms of the stunts. Well worth a watch on the biggest IMAX screen you can find.The performances in this film are what you'd expect from a Mission film. Lots of the same faces are here doing the same thing they've done before. The emotional stakes are perhaps a little higher here than in previous films, which gives the cast a chance to stretch their acting chops a little more, and they all do a fine job.Overall, this is a very satisfying, fun, and impressive follow up to Dead Reckoning. Whether you are a Mission die hard or simply looking for something to do on the weekend, you won't find much better than rocking up to your cinema and buying a ticket for the Final Reckoning!"

          "content": "Harry Houdini famously said \"I always have on my mind the thought that next year I must do something greater, something more wonderful\" and it seems Tom Cruise (TC), McQ and gang have adopted this approach in the last two movies, only problem is that it's victim to the law of diminishing returns. Yes you can put your main actor in a higher degree of stuntman danger and you can try to be even more clever but it ends up being like overstuffing a Christmas stocking with too many toys to play at once or so much ice-cream you get sick and a headache. More, more and more doesn't automatically mean better, bigger doesn't mean greater. Sadly the cracks in this latest MI movie had already shown in the last MI movie like a plane or submarine starting to come apart at the seams.So the components are good, some great actors, spectacular set pieces and high production values with military equipment worthy of a world superpower but there's one foundation that a good movie needs and McQ proved that many years ago - a great script. The writer of Unusual Suspects, McQ seems to have fallen under TC's spell of pushing boundaries without ensuring the story that underlies it makes sense. The first part of the film has so must exposition it needs an Austin Powers Basil Exposition to add some much needed humor. This film seems to have fallen into the same malaise as the last James Bond film, No Time to Die, it took itself so seriously at times that it overlooked the primary purpose of entertainment. In fact it was like TC, McQ and others wanted to emulate No Time To Die but take it to 11! But instead of adding another great edition to the MI franchise, it felt like \"enough already\". Would the world and the MI franchise be any worse off without this entry and the previous one? My answer - no! That's despite the fantastic stunts including those shown in the trailers of biplane feats a la TC. The problem with the plane action is not how impressive it is but how it forms part of a mission? When TC dropped from a ceiling or hung outside a building, it was THE mission, not improvised on the spot outside of the mission. There was a nice callback of a character but even that seemed a little too convenient and at times even silly. If TCs mission was to run this franchise into the ground like an out of control plane then Mission Accomplished. A complete wreck despite pulling out all the stops. Stop!"

          "content": "Let's get one thing straight: Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a cinematic experience that needs to be seen on the big screen. Visually, it's everything you'd expect from a franchise that redefined action filmmaking-sharp, sleek, and full of breathtaking stunts that make you shake your head in disbelief. Tom Cruise once again proves he's in a league of his own when it comes to commitment.But once the adrenaline wears off... you're left with a story that feels disappointingly stitched together.This film leans heavily into its blockbuster identity, more than ever before. And in doing so, it starts to drift too far from its roots in espionage, instead paddling into waters more familiar to superhero franchises. It borrows-often too obviously-from other iconic films: Aliens, Indiana Jones, even Top Gun (which this series has winked at before). These references aren't subtle, and they chip away at the tension, making key scenes feel less original and more like déjà vu.Rather than building upon the tightly woven tension and narrative weight of Dead Reckoning Part One, this sequel opts for a patchwork of disconnected set pieces. The thread tying them together-the AI threat-is intriguing on paper, especially in a world increasingly haunted by similar real-world developments. But in practice, the plot feels diluted. Major scenes play out with predictable outcomes, lacking the emotional punch or genuine surprise that past M:I entries nailed.What's most frustrating is the sense of wasted opportunity. The first part set us up for a truly explosive, perhaps even daring finale. A conclusion where Ethan Hunt could have met his end, passing the torch to Grace and elevating the importance of the team over the individual hero. Instead, we're left with a film that plays it safe, leaning more on nostalgia and spectacle than on narrative guts.This isn't a bad movie-not even close. It's entertaining, beautifully shot, and filled with jaw-dropping moments. But it's also a missed chance to do something bold. Something final.6/10 - Worth watching, but not the climax this franchise deserved."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning runs for a lengthy 2 hours and 49 minutes, so it's inevitable that the pacing starts off a bit slow, with a considerable amount of dialogue-heavy scenes for buildup. However, these scenes are laced with humor, which keeps them from feeling too dull. Once the main storyline kicks in, the film splits into two tracks - one focused on Tom Cruise's action sequences, and the other led by Angela Bassett's dramatic scenes.Tom Cruise's high standards for action scenes are a given, and the final hand-to-hand sequence on the airplane is especially intense - the kind of thrill that makes me want to experience it again on the big screen. On the other hand, the dramatic scenes hold their own, thanks largely to Angela Bassett's outstanding performance. Without her strong presence, those parts could have easily become boring and flat. Because of her, the tension and sense of threat posed by AI are effectively conveyed.Though the film is long, it never feels dragging. If there's one downside, it's that the dialogue is packed with too much information. This was likely a deliberate choice by the director and writer to add depth, but for most viewers, it results in both intrinsic and extrinsic cognitive overload."

He gives it his all in the movie but this was not the best in the series for me. Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol had a far interesting storyline and cast. It gets quite predictable in places and the last glider stunt was too long and overdone. Still the action is pulsating from the word go and there is no pause in the story.The nuclear holocaust scenes are beautifully done and overall the movie is visually captivating. I loved the background score also.Somehow felt a 3-body problem inspiration in some scenes,Overall a great watch if not the best one in the series."

Nukes, guns, explosions, close quarters combat, cars, planes, submarines, the list goes on and on.Inbetween the action, the acting, plot, and dialogue are clearly not the film's priorities. The story is the generic AI-anxiety stuff widely populating similar cinematic productions in recent years, but it gives Cruise enough of a canvas to have fun - with a huge budget behind him - and invite his audience along for the thrill ride. This is edge-of-the-seat action packed entertainment, epitomised.7/10."

In comparison, Final Reckoning feels more like a test of the audience's patience-much like the first installment. The direction leans heavily on overused, unnecessarily zoomed-in angled shots that come off as anything but cinematic. The dialogue is average at best, and the excessive explanation of every plot point treats the audience as if they can't keep up.The editing also falls short, several shots feel disconnected, breaking the flow. The background score doesn't help either; it lacks impact and often feels mismatched. The sudden shift to \"you're humanity's last hope\" and the repetitive use of words like \"entity\" weaken the script. The writing lacks subtlety and starts to feel forced. The only standout sequence is the James Cameron-esque 20-minute underwater scene, which is genuinely breathtaking.It's a letdown that there's no signature BMW chase. As always, Tom Cruise and his commitment to fitness remain legendary."

There's a constant barrage of music cues trying to tell you how to feel, as if that will somehow fill in the emotional gaps left by the shallow storytelling.By the time I walked out, I wasn't just bored-I was annoyed. Not only did the film fail to stand on its own, it seemed proud of being incomprehensible to anyone who hadn't done their homework.

And for me it does not work.Bringing back ground characters back from previous MI movies, who cares?! Tying the entity to what we saw in MI3. Why? We already had the setup in Dead Reckoning? Why make it any more complicated?!None of the epic / surprise set pieces such as the Kremlin bombing in Ghost Protocol are here. It very much needed something in the first 90 minutes, such as a nuke going off. Instead we are just told what the threat is and it goes on and on.No Masks, no Ethan completely surprisingly outsmarting the bad guy. It needed something epic, which I was expecting (Ethan had to outsmart the Entity and be a step ahead according to Luther!) For example Elsa could have surprisingly made it and just faked her death or so (in the party club scene in DR we saw Gabriel knives - I thought Ethan may have swapped them for dummy ones or so, the tools were there to do this).I'm not sure what they were thinking with this one.A real shame. Too much talk and hardly any fun.Worth seeing for the action.But stick to 4,5,6 and 7 for the best of the Mission movies. Those are funny, action packed and have much more heart."

Yeah, we seen Tom Cruise hang on every type of plane now. We know he's the biggest, manliest, man who ever lived... really. But the action became almost comedy. Not forgetting that something that should play within 10 minutes doesn't need to take 45 minutes of movie.Easily the worst movie in the franchise.

The cinematography was stunning, capturing both the beauty of the locations and the intensity of the action in a way that pulled me deeper into the experience.One of the things that elevated the film even more was knowing that Tom Cruise does his own stunts. Watching him perform these high-risk scenes with such precision and commitment added a whole new layer of excitement and admiration. It's not just acting - it's a full-on physical and mental performance that you rarely see at this level. Every stunt felt real and immersive because it was real, and that authenticity shines through.The emotional beats also hit hard. The character arcs were meaningful, and the stakes felt genuine, which made the quieter, more dramatic moments just as impactful as the high-octane ones. This film isn't just an action movie - it's a cinematic experience that combines thrilling spectacle with heartfelt storytelling. I can't recommend it enough."

If you are interested in a story that has some twists, turns, amusement and dialogue which makes you go wow, I did not find that, at any point. I felt the first movie set this one up so well to be brilliant, I really don't understand how the writers could have thought that this story was one which could light the audiences up, no matter how loud the soundtrack is and bangs are.I have personally enjoyed most of not all of the other entries to the franchise but this one left me really wanting, and I hope that they bring back another entry to recover from what was a very mediocre entry in my opinion which should have felt like the crescendo.This is one for home cinema, where you can have your phone next to you, as for 2hrs 20 out of the 2hrs 50 runtime you probably want to be playing with that which was more interesting."

Maybe, but that's not a dealbreaker for me, as always, Tom Cruise puts everything on the line for his audience, eight films in, and his commitment to quality is still unmatched, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames continue to shine as the emotional and comedic heart of the team, and the newcomers once again bring fresh energy to the ensemble.Excluding Mission: Impossible II, which still feels like the outlier of the franchise, The Final Reckoning serves as a fitting send-off, at least for now, it delivers the high-stakes tension, stellar performances, rich storytelling, and signature Mission: Impossible flair that fans have come to expect.In the end, The Final Reckoning is another reinforces why this franchise remains one of the greatest in modern action cinema."

The airplane sequence, the bomb that's about to explode (although it was a bit predictable), it was all thrilling.However, the story and the pace throughout the movie was kinda boring. Like it was overly long and so predictable. The throwbacks to the old movies feels forced and unnecessary. Some side stories are simply not necessary.The movie needed better writing, better story pacing, more unpredictable plot, more character play.Otherwise, go see the movie. It's worth a watch."

I spent 2 hours and 50 minutes holding my breath, watching what are quite possibly the two best action scenes I've ever seen.It's impossible not to see in this film a reflection by Tom Cruise on his career and on cinema: attempting the impossible to please as many people as possible, taking risks for the greater good, returning to something analog, more human, more disconnected.In short, the film struck me in a way I never would have imagined, thanks to its unwavering generosity and the work of a craftsman who does things right."

I see him as the last superstar who is the savior of the film industry by his quality films, which are distinguished from the cheap content of most streaming services. However, I admit I am disappointed with Final Reckoning. I expected a lot more of him, but unfortunately this franchise also falls into the same trap of cheap and cliché patterns! I hope he gets back with better and more exciting works in the future."

How this film has not got 90% onwards on rotten tomatoes is beyond me. This brilliantly concludes the Dead Reckoning storyline with incredible action, superb pacing and jaw dropping stunts! How some critics have stated that this film is bloated and said that this has a boring first hour just tells you everything that you need to know about how out of touch critics are. We will never see Tom Cruise's like again. Truly the last greatest action hero. The submarine and plane sequence in this film will leave you breathless. The returning cast are excellent and I loved the flashbacks to previous missions that enabled the stakes to be raised higher than ever before and has great tie ins to this film's central plot. Just a brilliant film. Thank You Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie."

          "content": "I wanted to rate it higher, to be honest I don't know how to rate this movie. Let's just start with pros:\n*Huge budget blockbuster action film, filled with action there is no stalling of the plot everything that happens moves the plot forward and to me it seems like a lot of things happened in the movie.*It's duration is almost three hours but it passed like it lasted an hour. Which means it is a very, very fun movie. Entertainment wise it is top notch, and that's what they were aiming for for exquisitely entertaining movie and I think we got it.*Now I'm like waiting and trying to think of a third pro of the movie... Let it me memorable moments because every good movie has memorable moments; those would be in order from last to forst-airplanes fight, bomb diffusion and waiting for Ethan to get the thing they need, while at the same time U. S. President wanted, and I'm not sure of this, nuke I don't know what exactly hahah. I mean I understood it was some sacrifice but why what was the target that is unknown to me and maybe it wasn't explained well maybe those three things made me forgot what the Administration wanted exactly (maybe to add to the drama).*Then we have, notice it's all team efforts many people had to do their mission to make the mission possible-the team gathering and sending coordinates, Ethan waiting for coordinates in their submarine and then that amazing, highlight of the movie getting the disk or what was it and surviving it.*That would be it if there were more memorable moments like these I'd remember them lol...And so we get to the cons of the movie which by my rating you might notice there will be lots of them, but hey everyone is a critic (albeit I am a bit harsh on this piece of art and it deserves higher rating for all those actions, activities, and locations that a higher rated movies like Sinner or Oppenheimer, Joker from 2019, why are they better when there is less happening in them, what for the messages they can't compare, okay Oppenheimer and Joker but Sinners (2025), I woudnt say it comes close to this movie and it's 8/10 in ratings, so let's start:*How did other countries not know about this major global event considering governments spy on each other, there was almost no reaction from other countries aside from few Russian soldiers to unintelligent to understand the coordinates might be in reverse, I expected, maybe that's my issue and not movies issue, that the Russians will understand what's happening but they decide to help or something. Also how countries governments and medias were left out of reacting to their A-Bombs being ready, I wanted to be like what the heck is happening while main characters are working on it, and maybe asking US all of them calling like they called Trump about tariffs and be like hey our Nukes are acting weird their launch lids are opening. Seems I wanted a bit more humor in the movie even thought that's a bit dark humor what I described.*This is the only unrealistic thing I will mention because I'm tired of writing and don't want to pick to much of how realistic the movie is, Gemini upon my request for answer writes: \"Swimming 300 feet to the surface can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes depending on individual swimming ability and external factors.\" And he was I am sure panting a lot to get trough missile launch tube in submarine, without his oxygen mask, by the way submarine sinked a bit more than 300 feet, anyways with that physical struggle that would take your oxygen Ethan \"The Whale\" managed to swim under the ice cap and choke. Then they brake it and take them out now I'm bothered they couldn't put him atleast under fake ice and get him out that would add so much but they skipped to reviving him. Maybe this is a bit petty con, because it might be best part of the movie.*Maybe this is just mine thing about some movies but it's predictable probably oth.... Surely many people said it's predictable. At every moment almost I knew what's going to happen next, in a meaning of course-it lacks plot twists it follows a course of action that everytime everything was done successful there were no fails except for villian sacrificing one of the important characters from franchise to get Ethan to do something. There's exposition dumping and kinda like I've seen it already, recyled or reused tropes in some parts I don't know.*Both AI system villian and human eh... Person villian were kinda even though the guy seemed like competent villian, they were kinda flat. Villian doesn't even get much screen time through most important part of the movie that middle, he was relaxing somewhere I guess. And AI is shown once when Ethan spoke with it, like did it have any influence except ability to talk to Ethan once in that capsule. I thought it will be able to do some things to like slow their progress they really progressed easily if you ask me, didn't doubt once they will fail anything. That's where drama was gone and thrill stayed since it's well a blockbuster action movie. But AI couldn't listen to them trough devices, do things with any electronic devices. It could only launch big kaboom rockets. Was it then AI or just a program to give Ethan a speech and launch nukes. And if it had such tremendous ability as to launch nukes why not other abilities to mendle with electronics that people and protagonists of the story used. See that's a plot hole of the story I'm sure there were other plot holes but this is enough.*And the last con of the movie unsatisfying ending like c'mon I want them to go on a vacation with atleast 10-15 minutes of screen time and have some relief, and rest and fun, and maybe a bit more of romance, among main characters, and celebration after all that running, and jumping and shooting, they only spent all that screen time for thrills and blame me but there should've been some light hearted funsies atleast on the end of the movie. So that we can be ahh that's a nice movie with satisfying ending them just chilling together or something anything to relax both characters and us viewers from all that mess they went trough.And that would be it. I hope this is a good read even though English is not my first language so excuse me, if anyone even reads this, for my grammar and syntax might be bit faulty and watching a movie wasn't tiresome as this considering it's bedtime to hah."

          "content": "After the incredible Dead Reckoning lit up cinemas last year, Mission: Impossible - Final Reckoning had the monumental task of keeping the momentum alive. The film picks up immediately after the last mission, with Ethan Hunt holding the key-literally and figuratively-to defeating the Entity. As someone who considers Dead Reckoning a near-perfect standalone entry in the franchise, I went into this follow-up with excitement dialed up to max-especially with rumors swirling that this might be Tom Cruise's final outing as Hunt.Unfortunately, Final Reckoning doesn't quite hit the same highs. It's far from a disaster-but for a series that built its reputation on topping itself every time, this installment feels more like a firm step sideways. Still, it delivers enough thrills, stunts, and cinematic spectacle to justify a watch, especially for longtime fans.Let's start with the positives. Tom Cruise, as always, is a machine. How this man is still dangling himself off planes, full sprinting like there is no tomorrow, and doing his own death-defying stunts is nothing short of astonishing. His dedication to the role-and to entertaining us-is unmatched. Indeed one of the last classic Action Hero. The supporting cast returns in fine form, though this time there's less emphasis on fleshing out the characters, since most of their development was already established in the previous film. What the movie does crank up is the tension. The stakes are apocalyptic, the \"impossible\" in Mission: Impossible has never been more literal, and the sequences that unfold-especially one standout set piece near the middle involving a terrifying chain of problem-solving-are pure white-knuckle cinema.Another rewarding element is how this film starts pulling together threads from earlier in the franchise. Legacy characters, old wounds, and hidden truths all begin to resurface resulting to unexpected revelations. For those who've been on this ride since 1996, there are a few great callbacks that pay off.That said, it's not without flaws. The first half drags due to a hefty exposition dump that slows things to a crawl. Even the pre-credits sequence-usually a thrilling calling card of the franchise (followed by the awesome MI theme)-feels underwhelming. It takes its sweet time ramping up, and while it eventually gets there, the journey feels longer than necessary. There's also a layer of preachiness about modern AI and global instability that, while timely, comes off a little heavy-handed.In the end, Final Reckoning is a good film-just not the grand finale we hoped for. If this truly marks Cruise's final bow as Ethan Hunt, it doesn't feel as conclusive or emotionally resonant as it should have. However, when viewed as a two-parter with Dead Reckoning, it elevates into something far more cohesive and satisfying."

I thought the submarine scene was rather long, I'm never a fan of underwater scenes but I understand Tom always wanted to do one.The ending was emotional and it was surreal to see a character from the first movie who was on screen for only a few minutes come back and play a pivotal role. His attitude to life is a lesson for us all. There's many aspects to this movie it's a bit hard to keep track but continuing on the theme is AI and the ability to take over our lives and have absolutely horrible consequences."

The action is spectacular as expected and masterfully executed. Tom Cruise brings his signature intensity, supported by a strong cast and some nice cameos. Nostalgic callbacks are integrated smoothly without overwhelming the plot. However, the movie sometimes feels too polished, missing the grit and unpredictability of earlier installments. Ethan Hunt occasionally comes across as oddly aimless, which doesn't quite fit his character. The frequent flashbacks, flashforwards, and alternate scenarios are an interesting stylistic choice, but used too often, they become distracting. Despite this, the film remains highly entertaining and engaging. As a potential final chapter, it hits many of the right notes. It's a satisfying watch, even if not entirely unforgettable.Fazit:\nA strong blockbuster that gives fans everything they expect - maybe even a little too much. Solid craftsmanship, great action, but lacking some emotional roughness. Still, an honorable send-off for Ethan Hunt."

However, even I, as a fan, didn't understand many things, and that's concerning. Too much information, too much...It's nice that the film made connections with the previous installments, but it almost slipped into the realm of a soap opera-almost. It's a different film, different from the others... it has no beginning, and it seems it has no end either. The film is a flat line, and the moment when that line should have spiked was the classic action scene that usually comes before the ending.What was missing was that spark, that fuse in the form of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme. That could have brought the audience to life, but instead, after everything, what remained was a flat line with a hint of disappointment.Should we be disappointed by the end of the franchise? Yes-but not in a way that leaves us emotionally drained. Then again, I don't know... maybe it had to be this way. Maybe this is it-the real end, a tribute to everyone who took part.Overall, a sad feeling..."

The good thing about watching a Mission:Impossible movie is that you can enjoy the action and thrills knowing Tom Cruise has really put himself through all the physical demands the role calls for without ever cheating the audience with CGI, body doubles or green screen. When you see him clinging onto the side of an aeroplane or free falling through the sky you know he's out there doing it for real, and all for our entertainment.The regular supporting cast of Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Henry Czerny are back along with Hayley Attwell, Pom Klementieff & Esai Morales from Dead Reckoning and Hannah Waddingham and Tramell Tillman being welcomed additions to the cast. There's also a nod to the first film with a returning cast member that has a nice reveal as well as various plot points and loose ends getting tied up.By now Tom Cruise knows what the audience wants and how to deliver and this film sets a high bar in high octane action and impressive stunt work. It's a spectacle for the big screen and is a thoroughly entertaining thrill ride that doesn't disappoint. However with a running time of 2hrs 49mins it does feel a tad too long with writing that is often cliched and talky, but I left the cinema actually wanting more in the hope that despite carrying off daring stunts at the age of 62 Cruise would return once more as Ethan Hunt."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is an absolutely action-packed movie, taking a more serious and grave tone than the previous installments of the series. It's full of constant high-tension and emotional moments, and insane stunts, as always. It is definitely long but has a solid way to end the entity's storyline (maybe?).Now that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has retrieved the cruciform key, the next step in destroying the rogue AI - \"The Entity\" - is finding the Podkova, which contains the original code of the AI and is at an unknown location at the bottom of the sea. So, Ethan and his team must travel the globe and find the Podkova before The Entity gains control of every nuclear arsenal and launches them, annihilating the world. It's a cautionary tale about AI and offers a scary view into the future of artificial intelligence's power.If you haven't watched Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 you should do so because it is the first part of this movie, but you don't need to watch any of the other earlier ones to understand the story, but long-time fans will enjoy all the references to past movies in this one. Even though this is the eighth film in the Mission: Impossible franchise, running at just under three hours - the longest Mission: Impossible movie yet - and has the word \"final\" in the title, it's unknown whether this will be the last assignment for Ethan Hunt after almost 30 years of missions. Almost all of the stunts in the Mission: Impossible movies are performed by Tom Cruise and always seem to outdo each other, but the stunts in this movie are so crazy that even professionals said they were impossible, but Tom Cruise was able to make them happen. There's a wing-walking stunt between two planes in this film - this isn't the first time Cruise has done stunts with planes, but in this particular situation, the original stunt teams said his vision was not possible. However, Cruise defied the odds and was able to do an extremely dangerous and extremely impressive wing-walking stunt. Along with all of these action-packed and impressive stunts, there's also a lot of fast-moving images and flashbacks to past movies, so I would advise you to be cautious while watching this movie if you are photosensitive. Ethan Hunt and his team, Benji (Simon Pegg), Grace (Hayley Atwell), Paris (Pom Klemenieff) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis), have such good chemistry and, despite being so different, they work so well together. Ethan spends a lot of time apart from his team, but his care for these people is so apparent. Some of these characters are on opposite sides of the original conflict, so it is very interesting to see their bonds grow through everything they encounter in this movie.The film's message is that teamwork and determination can make the impossible possible. Be forewarned that there is some profanity, intense fighting scenes, very gruesome situations and death. I do not recommend this movie for photosensitive or sound-sensitive viewers, as well as people who are sensitive to violent scenes.I give Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases in theaters on May 23, 2025.By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!"

The start is a bit slow, diving into and wrapping up loose ends from the rest of the franchise, (which is great if you're a long time fan) but once the story and action gets going it is truly amazing. This film has great balance of emotion, tension and fast paced action like that of Rogue Nation. Although not as tightly written as other films in the franchise like Fallout, it is an emotional and mind bending roller coaster for almost start to finish. Don't listen to the reveiws that claim that they are disappointed. If you aren't a cinema snob, the love and care put into this movie will certainly entertain you and blow you away."

Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie have gave us one of the best Mission films in recent years and truly a great ending to a franchise (if it is). Regardless it's better to watch it yourself and decide. (Preferably in IMAX) Though it is understandable that the film has a rather serious tone compared to other mission films it is too see the stakes of this mission which were one of the highest including a rouge AI and Nuclear Bombs."

          "content": "Remember when I told you in previous action movie reviews that the script is an excuse for the action sequences? Well, the latest installment, featuring the indefatigable Ethan Hunt, is one of the very few films where all the action is well justified and supported by the script. Everything has a plot weight, despite how difficult this may be for the genre, as Mission Impossible is crowned as one of the sagas with the most spectacular action sequences in the film industry, and star and producer Tom Cruise has taken care of and ensured this. This is the type of film that draws from the wellsprings of adventure films, like Indiana Jones, and adds a lot of suspense, James Bond-style.Now, you know that everything, no matter how healthy, is harmful if consumed in excess. Well, that's the big problem here, not only with this latest film, but also with the previous one. They tried to overdo it, they tried to overdo the spectacularity, they tried to overdo the incredible skill display of Ethan Hunt and his team. So the film inevitably falls from treating its audience as intelligent people capable of solving mysteries to intellectually slow people who absolutely need to be told and lengthened for a supposedly better understanding. Thus, the film becomes an unnecessary journey of almost three hours, when it could easily have been only two. Yes, it's a good action movie. Yes, it's a good adventure movie. Yes, the drama works well, although perhaps it needed a little more comedy, but it's not a Nolan labyrinth, nor a Villeneuve majesty.The technical aspects are all top-notch. The film is very well done. The visual effects, sound editing, and obviously the stunt work and choreography stand out above all others.This is a worthy end to a good saga; it's a must-see for 2025, but beware, it has its excesses."

While this installment isn't the strongest-yes, it's flawed-I'm still grateful we got to see Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt one last time. That alone made it special.I did wish they had done more with Gabriel as the villain. The buildup from the previous film hinted at a deeper connection to Ethan's past, but it never quite delivered. That was a missed opportunity. Still, the action is top-tier-especially the submarine and airplane sequences. Those set pieces reminded me why this franchise has always stood out.It may not be a perfect ending, but it's a heartfelt one. For fans like me, it's less about the plot holes and more about the journey coming to a close. Mission: Impossible gave us some of the most thrilling moments in cinema-and for that, I'm thankful."

          "content": "...A blockbuster film series unlike any other. What can one expect with the 8th installment that still tears through the sky, albeit after taking a deep breath. A long deep breath that separates this one from previous installments by pushing its leading hero, Ethan to his limits once again within a more serious situation than before. Doesn't mean it's completely humourless though. This is still an MI film at the core, it's got the same spices that made up previous films but now in different proportions. Critical analysis may reveal more flaws than I could notice but that was not the reason to not watch it. Nor did I want to see Tom Cruise being a goalless daredevil neither; there are much crazier ones in real life. It's a character's journey after all and it's a fun, thrilling ride.Trailers already \"spoiled\" about the major set pieces and yes, the plane scene is insane like the helicopter chase from Fallout. The standout scene however for me in this was the underwater one. Quite a few minutes long, dialogue free suspenseful, tension filled sequence that's borderline becomes a horror film, especially for those who easily get afraid of the vastness of an ocean. Other action scenes have the usual shooting-fighting combo, still well done. Except for one brief moment, I was engaged completely in this long movie, even its uneven pacing didn't really bother me much.What Fallout and Rogue Nation are, or even Ghost Protocol is for some, The Final Reckoning will not be, however this is the continuation to Dead Reckoning and some of the earliest ones too. Just to say it again, I can't recall no other movie franchise that even manages to stay this strong at its 8th film. Who cares about critical scrutinization anyway, it's fun like it's supposed to be, still extraordinary and still enjoyable.One more thing, it isn't the filmmakers fault for making long movies. It's their creative vision. It's the problem with studios for not having an intermission for movies longer than 140 minutes in film theatres. Seriously, intermissions would help both cinemas and movie-goers."

From underwater skirmishes to death-defying aerial feats, the action sequences are unmatched, a testament to the sheer dedication of the cast and crew. The cinematography shines during these moments, truly capturing the scope and intensity of the set pieces.However, despite picking up directly from its predecessor and seamlessly continuing the narrative, \"satisfaction\" remains elusive. The film, clocking in at a hefty 2 hours and 50 minutes, feels like a bullet train desperately trying to cram in too much story. The editing struggles to keep pace, leaving viewers disoriented in the initial half-hour, scrambling to catch the narrative rhythm. Perhaps a story of this depth warranted a trilogy rather than a two-parter, allowing characters more room to breathe and leave a lasting impression. The hurried pace leaves many questions unanswered, preventing that crucial sense of closure.My biggest, and perhaps most significant, disappointment lies with the musical score. The previous film's soundtrack was a character in itself, driving the narrative and amplifying every scene. Here, the music fails to leave any individual mark or signature, proving that a well-crafted score can indeed make or break a movie.In conclusion, while an undeniably great movie to watch for its unparalleled action, my expectations, perhaps set too high by prior installments, left me yearning for a more conclusive and satisfying ending. It's a fantastic ride, but one that ultimately pulls into the station without the grand fanfare I anticipated."

Instead, it felt like a drawn-out setup for the next installment rather than a satisfying story in its own right.Overall, it had moments of brilliance-but not enough to keep it from being, frankly, too boring."

However, while the expectations were sky-high, the film doesn't quite live up to the legacy of its recent predecessors.My Ranking of the Last 4 M:I Films:1. Dead Reckoning Part One - (4/5)2. Fallout - (3.5/5)3. The Final Reckoning - (3/5)4. Ghost Protocol - (2.5/5)What Worked:Underwater Submarine Sequence: Easily the film's most thrilling part - full of tension and visually stunning, it genuinely gave me goosebumps.Luther's Farewell: One of the most emotional highlights of the film. But what truly stays with you is Luther's voice-over at the end - peaceful, reflective, and touching in a quiet, beautiful way.Second Half: Stronger, more gripping, and packed with enough intensity to make the ticket price feel worth it.What Didn't Work:Recycled Ideas: The sequence where the Entity is dismantled feels like a direct copy of the plutonium detonator disarming scene from Fallout. Even the final aerial action is a weaker echo of the helicopter chase in Fallout.Weak Villain: Gabriel, as a villain, lacks depth and menace - a major drawback in a story where the core threat is already invisible.Pacing Issues: The first half drags and could've benefited from tighter editing. It feels stretched and somewhat disjointed.Story and Screenplay: While emotionally charged in parts, the overall plot lacks freshness and edge. For a franchise known for groundbreaking action and tight narratives, this feels like a step down.---Final Thoughts:Christopher McQuarrie - who raised the bar with Rogue Nation, Fallout, and Dead Reckoning Part One - falls short this time, especially when competing against his own high standards. This wasn't the kind of grand farewell Ethan Hunt or the Mission: Impossible franchise deserved. The film feels more like a decent continuation than a powerful conclusion.Verdict:\nA decent film with great moments, but not a great Mission: Impossible movie. Worth watching for the fans, but leaves you wishing for a more explosive send-off."

It starts to relieve countries of their nuclear capability and once it's done this and has found a place to hide (don't ask) it will blow the planet up. With the end nigh and bad guy Gabriel determined that he can control The Entity, our man must recover the original source code which is buried in a missing Russian submarine.I was a bit disappointed with Dead Reckoning and found the notion of The Entity a bit potty. This however is a considerable improvement on its predecessor and after a complex chunk of exposition linking everything to Hunt and his previous adventures, it settles into familiar territory. The various set pieces here are absolutely tremendous with exciting fight sequences and an exemplary scene on board a submarine - you really have to hand it to Cruise and McQuarrie. I might argue that it's not quite on a par with Rogue Nation or Fallout, but it's very very close. Great fun."

The notion that everybody, good guys, bad guys, whatever, all want EH to do their bidding is \"the Chosen One\" on meth-infused steroids.More retcons than a thing with all the retcons. No faith in your audience as you produce fifty flashbacks to explain who someone is to the audience you clearly think are too dumb to remember the last seven movies. People showing up with no explanation of how they figured out where someone is, just to \"twist\" the scene and have some new danger but no explanation of how they'd know to go there.As an aside, let me just say the retcon in the last movie that all of the IMF are former criminals is ludicrous and pointless.This movie is so bad that I'd think AI wrote it, except even AI can't write this bad. Absolute garbage.There are six MI movies, and they ended at Fallout. These other two abominations and actually anti-fan fiction written by possibly the Devil himself. Or the Devil's mentally handicapped child.Oh, I forgot: so many scenes that are just ripoffs of prior movies (biplane chase instead of helicopter chase, group effort to disarm bomb, Benji injured and coaching a woman through tech stuff, torture scene in dungeon with Ethan and woman (Atell instead of Ferguson), etc.).And in what fiction class is the bad guy nolking his head to lose an OK conclusion?"

I cannot at it.This is practically Cruise trying to recapture the his finals days as Ethan Hunt - spy extraordinaire.Sadly, I am not really the biggest follower of these franchise so there is literally no connection, and I was more bothered than anything that it tries to bat every SINGLE time that he is \"THE\" Ethan Hunt. Like this film glorifies him to the point of parody. The hottest, best thing since slice bread AND no one, can touch him. It even argues that he is the end all be all of these problem (with a slight slant for *dramatic* purpose) that it borders towards narcissism at times.Also, there so many moments of callbacks that feels far too much and practically destroys the pacing of the film. We get it, but there is a point where maybe this callbacks should have stopped. It just kept on pilling on until maybe an hour into the film. It was just at some point so head-inducingly clear that it wants to reference itself AND want's you know it.In the end, I think this particular film wants to evoke the successes of his mega blockbuster, Top Gun Maverick. Sadly, they do not understand that film's essence of time. It shows the effect in ways that transcend more than having beards. It actually tackles in length how aging affects everyone. It even tackles generational changes, especially how old is being replaced by the new. This was particularly, concerned with retaining Hunt as an end-all-be-all de-facto spy. My father actually asked me mid-film, why does no one really talk about his age in this film - and it was a very valid concern. He literally defied the power of physics in some scenes - which we all (my parents and I), where like ok that's too much for us to just blanketly just say that is possible. He just is THE MAN. It makes the sentimental gist of the film, personally a bit too trite and lacks true warmth for my taste.The stunts though was good.Not my cup of tea. Far too referential and lacks a certain flavor for a finale for a much loved franchise."

          "content": "Stakes are higher than ever, the stunts are deadly and jaw dropping and the overall challange is more impossible than ever before. There are some references to previous MI to tie them in with Final Reckoning that might not be needed, but I get that writers were trying to raise the stakes and make it more emotional, it partly worked. The mission challange is not just physical, it's emotional and psychological, and it takes the whole team to overcome, which is brilliant as always. The acting is up to the task from everyone. There are some little plot twists here and there, but the main attraction are the stunts and action sequences, some never before seen. I spent half of the movie with my jaw dropped cause it was a wild amazing ride, quite possibly the best movie of the franchise up there with Rogue Nation and Fallout.The only drawback, if this turns out to be the last movie, it doesn't have definitive character endings. I don't want to spoil anything, but it leaves it up for interpretation, which isn't bad within itself, but if you want to see a Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings type of happy definitive ending with Ethan retiring and living happily ever after, you won't get that, cause he wants to protect the love of his life (girl from MI:3) and others who he will never meet, this is reiterated a couple of times in the movie, so he will always be part of IMF. It was fine with me, it was well done, but I see online it bothered other people."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - Final Reckoning is nothing short of a masterpiece-an electrifying, emotional, and jaw-dropping conclusion to Ethan Hunt's saga. Tom Cruise delivers the performance of a lifetime, blending relentless physicality with raw vulnerability that makes every moment hit hard. The stunts, including a vague reference, e.g., \"gravity-defying aerial sequence\", are so breathtaking I forgot to blink. Christopher McQuarrie has perfected the Mission: Impossible formula. The pacing is relentless, the plot is intricate yet accessible, and the ensemble-Hayley Atwell's fiery Grace, Rebecca Ferguson's steely Ilsa, and Ving Rhames' soulful Luther-elevates every scene. The cinematography turns vague location, e.g., \"urban sprawls and icy peaks\" into a character of its own, paired with a score that's pure adrenaline. What truly seals the 10/10 is the heart. This isn't just about saving the world; it's about Ethan's legacy, his sacrifices, and the family he's built. Subtle callbacks to the 1996 original had me teary-eyed, and the climax left me speechless. No flaws, no filler-just perfection. Spoiler-Free Verdict: Final Reckoning is the best Mission: Impossible yet, a cinematic triumph that demands to be seen on the biggest screen. A standing ovation for Cruise and team!"

          "content": "After more than 30 years of thrilling audiences around the world, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Final Reckoning) delivers an explosive and emotional culmination to one of the most iconic action franchises in cinematic history. This film is not just a sequel - it's a celebration of everything that made Mission: Impossible unforgettable.From the opening scene, the movie grips you with its high-stakes intensity. Director Christopher McQuarrie masterfully blends breathtaking action sequences, clever callbacks, and emotional depth, all centered around a timely and thought-provoking plot. The concept of artificial intelligence threatening to take over the world is handled with nuance, offering a chilling reflection of our current technological age.Tom Cruise once again proves why he remains one of the greatest action stars of all time. His portrayal of Ethan Hunt is layered - fearless, loyal, and deeply human. Every stunt feels real, every decision weighted, and every mission truly impossible. The supporting cast brings both charisma and gravitas, grounding the film's larger-than-life stakes.What makes this installment stand out is how it seamlessly weaves in the legacy of the past films - a perfect tribute to fans who have followed Hunt's journey from the beginning. It's a cinematic full-circle moment: rich with nostalgia, yet forward-looking and fresh.The screenplay is tight, the pacing relentless, and the set pieces - from death-defying train fights to globe-spanning chases - are executed with jaw-dropping precision. But what truly elevates this movie is its heart. Beneath the explosions and espionage lies a story about trust, sacrifice, and the price of saving the world.Verdict:\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Final Reckoning) is more than a blockbuster - it's a masterclass in action storytelling. A must-watch for longtime fans and newcomers alike, this is arguably the best entry in the series and a high point in Tom Cruise's legendary career."

          "content": "This story isn't told through moving pictures but in lengthy boring dialog between the action scenes, probably because the story is way too complicated for the medium. There is not much comic relief here, but when Ethan Hunt, alone in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean, suddenly calls out \"torpedo tubes\" into his scuba mask - just to let viewers know that he's going to them - you can't help but laugh at the poor story-telling. The rest of the dialog is often extremely pretentious, like \"Our lives are the sum of our choices\", and yes, they really say that, and a lot more in the same style.It is impossible to write an exciting story about an evil computer program, I thought Eagle Eye proved that, and its' first half was still much more promising than anything that happens here.I love Tom Cruise, but he's getting old. To hide that, he mainly plays against even older people here. So the average age in this \"action\" movie is about twice of what you're used to. I don't mind, people can be of any age, it's just very uncommon to see a box-office movie not featuring that many people below 50.I'm sure there once was a reason why they brought in Simon Pegg, but he is completely lost here, this movie isn't fun, ever, there is not one singe funny scene, no place to smile. My guess is that you are going to find it boring. Did I say it's also way too long?"

I was watching the movie for 15 minutes and was thinking \"oh my god, another 2,5 hours to go\" and I'm not the type of person who can't enjoy a simple action movie. The movie was just trying to be too emotional, too important and too serious for it not to be. So I sadly can't recoomend to watch this movie."

          "content": "-final Reckoning\nThe Most Disappointing Mission YetTom Cruise has built a legacy on delivering high-octane action, jaw-dropping stunts, and sleek espionage thrills with the Mission: Impossible franchise. Unfortunately, with the latest installment, Mission: Impossible - Reckoning, that legacy takes a serious hit. It's not just a stumble-it's a full-on faceplant.From the start, the movie feels bloated, weighed down by a convoluted plot that tries to be too clever for its own good. What once made Mission: Impossible exciting-tight pacing, razor-sharp suspense, and smart twists-has been replaced by drawn-out exposition, forced emotional beats, and an overuse of CGI that undermines the franchise's hallmark practical stunts.Even Cruise, usually a force of nature, seems like he's running on fumes. Ethan Hunt feels less like the relentless spy we know and more like a tired echo of himself, stuck in a script that doesn't do his character-or Cruise's commitment-any justice. The new characters are either forgettable or painfully underdeveloped, and returning faces are largely wasted in thankless roles.Perhaps most disappointing is the film's inability to deliver a satisfying payoff. The stakes never feel real, and by the final act, the movie devolves into noise and chaos without clarity or impact. It tries to set up a grand narrative arc but forgets to give us a reason to care. The villain does not live up to the demand and expectations . Even though Esai Morales is a good actor this role did not suit him.For a franchise that redefined itself with each new entry, Reckoning is a rare misstep-and easily the weakest link in the Mission: Impossible chain. Let's just hope this mission is one Cruise chooses not to accept again."

While the cast remains talented, the pacing and energy just weren't there, and the performances felt more subdued than usual.Most surprisingly, the action - which is usually the series' standout feature - failed to impress. While technically competent, none of the sequences felt memorable, and the film leaned too heavily on familiarity instead of innovation.It's not a terrible film by any means, but for a MI series, it felt underwhelming.

With so much exposition, it treated the audience as dumb. Worst, the franchise has evolved from a smart espionage thriller to a superhero story. The origin story of the original films has been changed and credibility is not just strained but broken and swept out the door. I found the attempt at creating suspense was undermined by the trailer which makes you recognise there's no \"skin the in the game\" at any time, except almost at the end. By then whatever good will the film had created was long gone. I just stopped caring for the fate of characters let alone the world. A few parts are entertaining, but mostly it isn't. I can't even recommend it for a cinema experience of the stunts. It's the kind of action film that would be watchable with beer and pizza at home. The film is in dire need of a pair of scissors."

          "content": "A blockbuster. Good storyline and great action scenes. I read the film cost nearly 400 million to make and the end product is well worth going to the cinema to watch.The film really gives a great effort to make it a final film. A send off for Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. It needed a tight story and one that eclipsed all the prior films made. It achieves that by making the stakes impossibly high. And for me it worked.I worried about the length of the film but the pacing of the unfolding story and the action sequences kept me engaged throughout.I wondered how they would get on with not having Ethan Hunt - who obviously is no spring chicken anymore - do over physical scenes. Other than the final scenes - it substituted them with more subtle actions.Recommended. I somehow don't think this will be the final film. How they will manage a screenplay/film story to beat this one though with Tom Cruise playing Ethan Hunt may well be...impossible!"

It feels like a see you soon, more than a goodbye forever.It's worth watching. It is built like a typical mission impossible and written to seem like the mission is impossible to build suspense and excitement, which happens now and again.However, some of the scenes are very long and detailed. They're clearly trying to build suspense but I couldn't help feeling bored by the end of some scenes and the wanting for the story to move on.On top of this, the story line in this movie is far from realistic which frustrated myself a little bit. I felt like they could have gotten some specialists in to just finesse the ending.I think this movie could have easier been a 9, with some of the fluff cut out and the ending made more realistic. Without spoilers I can't detail why."

Great film, excellent set pieces but it's missing the percussive power of both Lorne Balfe's stellar soundtracks that powered Dead Reckoning & Fallout and Joe Kraemer's Rogue Nation. As this is a clear continuation of the previous film it is a damn shame there wasn't a continuity of soundtrack composition by the incomparable Balfe. That was a disappointment for me as a soundtrack fan. Apologies to the composing pair of Final Reckoning but I'm afraid this music falls short of the driving force of the previous films. Not sufficient variation of Schifrin's themes (Main Title & The Plot). It didn't have the orchestral oomph to accompany the excitement of the movies. I'm uncertain if I'll purchase the soundtrack when it becomes available. (Oh... who am I kidding? I'm a completest; of course I'll get it! It just won't be on hard rotation like the other films' music.)"

When I sit down to watch a Mission: Impossible movie, I expect fun, thrilling action, a solid story, and a compelling villain. Unfortunately, this installment didn't deliver on those fronts even though it arguably had one of the most interesting story concepts in the entire series.The film touches on a timely and thought-provoking topic: artificial intelligence. It's something we're all dealing with today and asking serious questions about. But instead of diving deeper into that concept, the movie only scratched the surface. We're told what the AI (The Entity) wants, but the why behind its actions is vague and leaves too many unanswered questions.Another misstep was the emotional focus. The film tried to make us worry about the characters, but it didn't quite succeed. I found myself more concerned about the global threat than invested in the personal stakes. The development of Ethan Hunt felt lacking, and that's a shame considering how crucial his journey is to the franchise.The villain was another missed opportunity. There was potential for a fascinating dynamic between him and The Entity, but it wasn't explored enough. I wanted to know more about their connection and motivations.On the bright side, some of the action scenes were outstanding as expected from a Tom Cruise movie. He still brings intensity and commitment to every stunt.Overall, Dead Reckoning Part One is watchable, but it could've been so much more. It had all the ingredients for a classic, yet failed to fully capitalize o."

          "content": "As far as overbloated with new ideas and nostalgia final installments in franchises go, M:I Final Reckoning sadly has a lot less in common with The Dark Knight Rises and feels a lot more like The Rise of Skywalker.That said, the action is as great as always and the stunts are incredible. Tom Cruise is stellar, and he deserves this parade of a movie for all the work he's done. McQuarrie does wonders directing these scenes, and we finally get to see the stunts without any noticeable distracting CGI backgrounds and foreground elements. The real stunts now look like real stunts! Surprisingly, this is an M:I film with surprisingly low amounts of action.This isn't necessarily a problem. I've seen this franchise do political intrigue well and have excelent, really tense scenes. It is a spy film, after all. This movie, however, is filled to the brim with really bad exposition. It drags and spends more time trying to tie all films together than actually making sense by itself.It's also edited like a saw film. You'll hear characters namedrop something and it will cutback to another film in the franchise, constantly. Hayley Atwell's character sadly becomes someone completely soulless since Dead Reckoning and Pom Klementieff's character trait is now \"is french\".I really meant my Rise of Skywalker comment. I came out of the movie theater last week thinking of a lot of similarities between the plot structure of that movie and this one, and after simmering, I can't really deny it either. For me personally, this film is sadly going to be the reason why a franchise rewatch of Mission Impossible is always going to fizzle out before I get to the final films. A shame, because I genuienly believe every movie after the third has only gotten better and better. Sadly, we now have an exception."

The editing wasn't as good, nor the screenplay or the script. The casting is great as is the cinematography, score and of course, the stunts.Apparently MITFR cost $400m which is a whopping sum. I'm sure it will do well and my score of 7/10 puts it in good company. The 2;51 runtime flew by and there are some very tense action sequences therein. I just felt the development of the supporting characters was way below par compared to other films and Gabriel, the antagonist, is basically a cardboard cutout of the Gabriel we met in 2023's MIDRP1."

          "content": "3.6/5.0 STARS - The Final Reckoning picks up not long after the events of Dead Reckoning, and it is, effectively, a Part 2 of the storyline from the one that came before it (despite the slight title change - i.e., dropping a formal \"Part 2\" from the name). This franchise has been consistently enjoyable for me (NOT COUNTING THE HORRENDOUS SECOND ENTRY), though some entries are more solid than others. The third film is probably my favorite of them all because of its gripping emotional storyline, the excellent acting by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played a chilling and formidable adversary for Ethan, and the fact that it single-handedly saved this franchise for me after the disaster of Part II. Dead Reckoning was enjoyable, BUT it stretched the limits of my ability to suspend disbelief probably more than all the other films did (not counting the second one; let's just pretend that film doesn't exist - can you tell I hate that movie???). And I could not STAND the new female \"partner/team member\" character played by Hayley Atwell. She was weakly written, her continued existence in the film as it went on felt forced, and after a certain event it became clear she was a \"replacement\" character for another one. The way events went down in that regard cemented my dislike for her character to the point that I began actively wishing for her demise. She is a bit more tolerable in Final Reckoning; her presence wasn't even the reason for some of the issues I had with this film. If I thought my ability to suspend disbelief was seriously challenged by Dead Reckoning, Final Reckoning pushed it over the edge for good. I love a good action film as much as any fan, but when there are repeated instances of there being no actual believable way someone could survive the things that Ethan did in this movie, it ends up being a detraction from my overall enjoyment more than anything else. Like many sequel-heavy film franchises, Mission Impossible sufferers from the erroneously mentality that \"bigger must be better\" (whether that be action sequences or plot) and veers into highly predictable terrible. Esai Morales's portrayal of the \"big bad\" in these two movies also began to wear thin, as he ended up feeling more like a cookie-cutter, mustache-twirling type who is magically able to be everywhere he needs to be and has resources that make him virtually an unstoppable force, like Superman. It makes for a boring antagonist. Having said all of THAT, this film still had plenty of fun and gripping moments, despite the obvious emotional manipulation of some scenes. There were some nice surprises in the form of a previous character or two who made a return, good moments of comedy/levity that helped mitigate the tension but didn't feel goofy, and the acting was solid. The stunts were amazing, as was the cinematography (especially during a particular scene involving a sunken submarine), and even though it clocked in at close to three hours, I can't say I was bored. I also liked how the plotlines of at least two of the previous films tied in a bit with what was going on in this one - creating some interesting \"full circle\" moments, if you will. It's clear Tom Cruise adores his job and loves to make films that cater to audience enjoyment. His passion for what he does shines through clearly in Final Reckoning, and that's something I can appreciate. The audience seemed to really enjoy the viewing experience and there were several moments of laughter, exclamations of sadness/dismay at certain events, and applause at the end. I think most fans will enjoy it, but it's nearly three-hour runtime makes me wonder who well this will perform over the weekend. And whether it will have a better turnout than Final Reckoning, which underperformed. Video review available on my YouTube channel."

          "content": "The culmination of a 30 year franchise ends in a fitting conclusion with Tom Cruise's swan song as IMF Agent Ethan Hunt performing some of the most insane stunts ever seen on screen.This final installment adopts a noticeably more serious tone than its predecessors. Gone are many of the gadget-heavy spy tropes and rapid-fire twists, replaced by a sense of finality and gravity that befits a closing chapter. Some fans may miss the lighter, more frenetic energy of earlier entries, but for a conclusion, the weightier approach feels earned.The first act suffers from choppy pacing and a montage-heavy structure that suggests a much longer cut was left on the editing room floor. But once the narrative settles, it locks into place with gripping intensity, and despite a nearly three-hour runtime, the film never overstays its welcome.Surprisingly, the action is more restrained-there are essentially only two major set pieces-but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in sheer scale and execution. Director Christopher McQuarrie and Cruise clearly held nothing back for their final bow, delivering sequences that are as thrilling as anything the series has ever offered.Tom Cruise is most definitely the last true movie star dedicating his craft always for the benefit of the audience. He literally puts his life on the line for our enjoyment and I thank him for it.It's not the best in the franchise, the plot not especially original and with a bland villain, but I was entertained and engaged throughout and that's all I can ask for.I'm sad to see the end of possibly the greatest action movie franchise ever and I wish it had more of an emotional gut punch for its final send off, but it's been a hell of a 30 year ride and should Ethan Hunt ever choose to accept one last mission, you can bet I'll be right there with him."

What it also lacks is any kind of bonding or emotion for the characters , couldn't care less who dies and who lives.If I hadn't been with friends I would have left the cinema half way."

          "content": "My introduction before the review: That's it, folks. Hollywood has come to an end. This review isn't just a review, it's a statement of what's going on in Hollywood right now. For over 3 decades, Paramount has created the epic \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise.I have seen all of them, included the previous one \"Dead Reckoning: part one\" that I thought was a real blast, and my personal favourite from the Christopher McQuarrie direction. Sadly I gotta be harsh, \"Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning\" is by far the worst Mission movie yet, but the greatest example of what's going on with Hollywood and movies in general right now. If you are into movies and cinema like me, you probably track the movie news often. From the terrible \"Snow White\" (2025) to last years \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" (2024) and back again to the new mediocre \" A Minecraft Movie\" (2025). Like director Quentin Tarantino said lately in an interview \"What is a f***ing movie now?\" ,him concluding that 2019 was \"The last year of movies\". While I agree with him at many points, we see there are voices that try to break through the crap.We got \"Oppenheimer\" (2023), last years \"Anora\" (2024) and an amazing new film by Ryan Coogler called \"Sinners\" (2025). That's the voices we need to hear, unfortunately, the box office suggest otherwise. If you relate to any of this, you got to know that Hollywood will change if more people see statements like this. Please upvote this review after reading if you agree with me.Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning: I don't know what made me first suspect this movie was \"made by Ai\", but I think the editing part hit me before the script. I don't know, but this film was edited by a completely different guy, and it was edited basic. Like not-mission-impossible-standards. It was almost edited as an Ai would suggest, from the action to dialogues to the elements before the event. That was the first part that hit differently, but hah! This isn't it. The script, oh my god the script... I've heard people suspect Ai writing the script for \"Wish\" (2023) and \"The Marvels\" (2023) but for me it was just terribly written scripts by people that ain't Paul Shrader or Jim Jarmusch. This film was genuinely written by an Ai, and I would be surprised if it weren't. I've used tools like ChatGPT and Blackbox before, and I think they are good if you use them right. But as you get familiar with them, you understand its style better. I have often asked ChatGPT to write a random script out of curiosity, and it has the same style all the time. It is: Writing one event after another with a predictably plot twist, trying to cover all points of a good script but lacks all of them, use the same timing on conflict/conversations, and makes up basic and predictable events. Now all this points may seem good but you might think it's only a big coincidence. I recommend you to read some ChatGPT scripts detailed and later watch this film. Because this was just not acceptable, and already a sign of lazy, fast-producing Hollywood. But okay, let's look outside of the script. The story follows the events of \"Dead Reckoning: Part one\" and follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) that must stop a powerful artificial intelligence source called \"The Entity\" to prevent it from destructing the world. I won't spoil so that's all I gotta say. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt plays well but for this being \"the final film in the franchise\" I would love to get more development from him, making Ethan a more vulnerable person, a person we gotta see through completely on his final battle. Ethan Hunt has some friends from the previous film (included the long-time Benji from way before \"Dead Reckoning: Part one\") and some new friends, and together they create somehow a team , that I would somehow call a blend off \"The Expendables\" and \"Scream\". Anyway I hope this gives you a bigger understanding on the cons. Very bad script, very bad editing, and undeveloped story and characters goes against everything of what makes a good film. If I have to pinpoint the hype of the film and the only good thing that made me give a few stares more is the epic plane-scene that is also featured in the trailer. Then I ask again: Why featuring the best stuff in the trailer? But I gotta admit, Tom Cruise did what he does best. The plane-scene was an absolute blast and for me personally the greatest stunt from the franchise (Besides the Burj Khalifa stunt in \"Ghost Protocol\"). Like come on friends, when you see stuff like that, you're always impressed, especially when it's no CGI or VFX. So yeah, I think Paramount did have a back-up plan if the rest of the film is shit, and yeah, they partially did. To conclude, this movie is the beginning of Hollywood falling. We need more of the good content, the content that really makes cinema a magical place! Please bring in more movies like \"Sinners\", more movies like \"Anora\" because this is a time when we need more movies like that. I hope you did get something out of my review, and that you can take this knowledge and avoid this film if you can. My final rating is 4/10."

It's still better than the awful second one but it has a lot of problems.The first hour is sloppily and jarringly edited together compiled mostly of exposition and flashbacks.The combat s ends are quite obviously sped up which reminded me of those Roger Moore Bond action scenes.The story is pretty badly written but the film is somewhat saved by a gripping third act. However this would've meant a lot more in a better more entertaining film that wasn't so full of itself.It lacks the fun and flow of the better entries and it's just not a great film to finish on no matter how much of a forced wrap up of all that came before it tries to be."

          "content": "I really wanted to like this movie, and it hurts to say that it is actually very mid. It tries to be extremely high-stakes but forgets what made the best mission films so great-not only the action but also the characters. It's hard not to see that the plot is there just to fill the time between the key stunts. But I'd like to go into more detail, starting with what I liked.1. Cinematography and action. As usual, the cinematography is strong with this one. Some of the shots were jaw-dropping, hands down. The submarine underwater sequence is a masterclass in tension. I forgot all the problems I had with the plot while watching it. Truly beautiful. No matter the issues that I will list further, I still have a crazy respect for Tom Cruise doing this for real and bringing the best action possible.2. Benji. I absolutely love everything they did with this character. From being a nameless computer guy, to Ethan's close friend and partner, to actually becoming a co-leader with Ethan. Definitely well built and deserved.3. Some connections with previous movies felt nice; one even had a great message behind it. Though I have to say, it felt like the creators didn't trust the audience enough to recognise them. For example, when one of the characters was brought back from another M:I, Benji immediately started explaining who this guy was, which killed some of the joy for me, as a fan.But, even if I wouldn't call TFR a bad movie, it is a very flawed one.1. The whole \"CHOICE\" situation is stupid. It's never once foreshadowed in any of the first six movies, so it feels like a retcon. Why was this even needed? It brings nothing to the story apart from Grace joining the team, which could've been done in a dozen other ways.2. This movie has some of the heaviest exposition I've ever seen. It felt dragged a lot of times. Not Andor-slow, rather just dragged and pointless. Characters explain things all the time, repeating and finishing each other's sentences. And even with so much info being said, it still sometimes gets unclear who the villain is or what motivation/goals they have.3. We learn NOTHING about the Gabriel-Ethan relationship, which was teased so much in Part 1. Honestly, in the end, if Entity chose any other guy and not the one who happens to be Ethan's old enemy, nothing would've changed. Like absolutely nothing. What was the point of those flashbacks in Part 1? We have no idea what the situation was, who that woman was, why Gabriel killed her, or why Ethan was framed for it. It brings nothing new to Ethan's character. Also, Gabriel himself is boring. We know nothing about him, and if in theory, this could've been intimidating, in practice, it just makes him a poorly written villain. Why establish a detailed background and motivation for a character if we can just throw in the same flashback here and there and make Ethan panic when he sees him the first time in DR :) (I am not saying this franchise always had nuanced villains. It's an action blockbuster of all things. But Gabriel is just rock bottom.)4. Final fight with Gabriel didn't feel earned or satisfying, because Gabriel is probably one of the most passive villains I've ever seen. He makes some bald statements and runs away the whole movie. And when he finally gets defeated, the scene itself is straight out of the comedy genre, in a film that otherwise tries to be obnoxiously serious.5. Villains in this movie generally take minimal conscious action, so they do not feel intimidating or engaging. This is especially true of AI. It is hard to be afraid of it. AI enemy sounds cool on paper, but it doesn't really fit in Mission's formula. My concerns from watching DR were proven true. In the end, all we got was a race for an ultra-tech macguffin, which has to connect to other macguffin, which can be found by using another macguffin, only then to use the final macguffin at the right timing to defeat the Entity. Sounds stupid and boring? It is. That is the price for having the enemy you can't see in the media, where everything is based on seeing.6. Yes, some villains from other iterations might not have been top-level, but at least the characters around Ethan made the movie engaging. This brings us to secondary characters in this movie. Paris... Pom Klementieff did a great job, but she did not have a lot to work with, unfortunately. We do not learn anything new about her. I really wanted to see her character developed in this movie, but it's just a sad mess, honestly.7. Same goes for Degas. He showed signs of conscience, joined Ethan to save the world, and then completely disappeared from the plot.8. There is just too many side characters, especially in the government and military. Most of them don't even have names. They are just plot vessels, not actual people.9. Lite spoiler: In the film's first minutes, you get a montage of key moments from previous entries. That looked peak in the trailer, but watching it again in the actual movie felt very cheesy. I felt like watching a fan edit on TikTok, not a Hollywood blockbuster.10. That ending... Probably the worst Mission ending ever. Extremely cliche and lacks emotion. I can't believe this is all they came up with, especially considering this is supposed to be the ending of a 30-year-long journey.11. Probably the weakest soundtrack we got since MI3. Not a musician, so I won't be commenting on this, but subjectively it is definitely not as consistent and emotional as previous ones.For me, this movie can be best described by my favourite quote from Arcane. In pursuit of the highest stakes possible, more characters than ever, and the longest, most extreme stunts, they failed to deliver the characters that make the audience care, stunts that feel natural inside the plot, and a villain who is actually intimidating."

The beginning felt like an introduction, which might be necessary for first time mission impossible viewers, though quite repetitive for those who have seen Dead Reckoning. The flashbacks and flashforwards to explain the story was a lazy choice in my opinion and it was one the big negatives in this film. The whole story is constantly being explained leaving no room for mystery, some intrigue or some unpredictable moments. Actually it becomes almost annoying because the dialogue is just sloppy, leaving very little for the actors to work with. Fortunately some momentum is gained as the movie progresses, mainly from the stunts which are absolutely incredible and let's be honest, you probably won't find anything that comes close in any other type of media. Though this momentum doesn't last long because of all the explaining again and the bad guys seeming to be there only for show. What I'm trying to say is that Yes the action sequences are obviously the main selling point of MI but not the only one. An interesting story that keeps its viewers guessing is what separates an OK MI from a great MI. I don't know, maybe they messed up the editing? I think the writing was a problem, the whole thing seemed rushed.I think i will just rewatch Fallout to feel good."

Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (or whatever overcooked name they gave it this time) is less \"impossible mission\" and more \"recycled plot with dramatic whispers.\"The entire movie is a TED Talk on \"How to Ruin Suspense 101.\" Every scene is basically a group huddle where someone urgently says, \"We need to get the key!\" followed by someone else saying, \"The key to what?\" and another genius adds, \"To stop The Entity!! Then someone gasps and adds, \"But we need the poison... to stop the device... to control the algorithm... to destroy the system... to protect free will?\" Bro, just unplug the Wi-Fi.Tom Cruise runs a lot, because that's what he does. The rest of the cast stares dramatically into midair, while parroting dialogue like, \"If we don't do this now, we might never be able to not undo what's already been done before it happens.\"The villain? Basically ChatGPT with a grudge. The stakes? World-ending, as always. The tension? Nonexistent, because every moment is spelled out like the movie doesn't trust us with basic cognitive skills. It's like someone found the old Mission: Impossible script, spilled a pumpkin spice latte on it, and then shot it in slow motion.You'll leave the theater exhausted, confused, and questioning your life choices.

Please, when does it stop.While The Final Reckoning delivers the franchise's signature action and stunts, it continues a troubling pattern of underrepresenting and underdeveloping its female characters. Despite the presence of talented actresses like Hayley Atwell and Rebecca Ferguson, their characters often serve as mere accessories to Ethan Hunt's narrative, lacking depth and agency.This pattern reflects broader issues in Hollywood, where age disparities between male leads and their female co-stars are common, and women are often cast in roles that emphasize their appearance over their capabilities. Such portrayals reinforce outdated gender norms, suggesting that women's value diminishes with age and that their primary role is to support the male protagonist.The consequences of this persistent underrepresentation are significant. They perpetuate stereotypes, limit the scope of stories told, and deny audiences the opportunity to see women as fully realized characters with their own narratives."

The entities final objective is also ridiculous and could have been more easy achieved a thousand different ways.The worst part was the directing. The characters talk about everything they are going to do before they do it. It gets really annoying tbh. Their narration bounces from person to person like they are a hive mind or like they are trying to share the script equally. Its like getting spoilers in the movie about the movie.The acting was terrible, everybody cries all the time it's out of place. The movie initially tries to be funny but that fails. Then oddly the movie shifts to complete seriousness no humour.There was barely any action. Lots of really drawn out scenes, honestly the movie dragged on and on. It could have been 1.5 hours shorter.There were way too many tributes.Finally, not sure how Luther was able to do what he did completely isolated with no knowledge of the entity.

          "content": "SPOILERS AHEADIt's not as disappointing as the conclusion to Game of Thrones, but if I made a list of most disappointing conclusions to a long-running series, this would be on it.The biggest problem for me: the second biggest set piece is the underwater submarine scene. There is about 25 minutes with zero dialogue. I like the idea of focusing on the images, music and suspense without talking. But the scene has to be enthralling. And it wasn't for me. It was just a lot of swimming.At one point, I literally thought, \"Alright enough of this, let's get to the next scene.\" Which is sad because I know how much effort they put into making this look real, using mostly practical effects like spinning hallways (a la Inception). But it just drags.Combine that with a 20-ish minute slower part before and after, and you have about an hour in the middle where I could feel myself slowly becoming less engaged.And the cherry on top, the submarine scene ends with an absolute \"are you kidding me\" moment. Even if you ignore the pressure and all the other problems with swimming from the bottom of the ocean to the surface, he does it without an air tank. They skip past like it took a few minutes to reach the surface.It would take at least 30 minutes, and that's if it wasn't even that deep. It would take nearly two hours from the deepest. And there are a handful of other questionable parts and things that don't make sense.Not one action scene is better than ANY of the scenes from Fallout. Not one action scene would be on my top 10 of the Mission: Impossible franchise (maybe not in the top 15). Even the best sequence, the plane chase during the climax (which I liked), was already done in the climax of Fallout. Helicopters instead of planes, and it's ten times better.The explanations of what needs to be done and how hard it would be sounds more and more... made up. Overly complicated without much creativity. And of course we spend a bunch of time on new side characters involving the president and her generals. It's SOOOO pointless and could have been removed from the movie without changing anything.I also found it hilarious that they try to make it seem like the president or her generals actually care about civilian casualties. I could see Ethan Hunt and his team caring. But the rest just makes it feel like fantasy land. And don't get me started on the idea to nuke your own people so that other countries aren't as mad when you nuke them. What????They try to conclude the series with a LONG goodbye scene, but I felt zero emotional payoff. And this is coming from someone who watched the entire series before this movie, and before the last one. I was already invested in the characters. It goes to show how unengaged I was.Tangent: Stop putting spoilers on posters!!! I already avoid watching trailers since they spoil everything (I literally stand outside the auditorium until the movie starts). But this is the third movie this year where the poster shows a spoiler from the climax or even the final scene (Final Destination: Bloodlines, and Captain America: Brave New World). It makes the entire scene less exciting if we know what's going to happen.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 5/22/2025)"

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is bombastic to put it mildly, given all the fast-paced exposition and visually resounding action setpieces.While after the Hitchcockian narrative of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, this concluding chapter somewhat may feel a bit inadequate - especially with all those lots of scenes in caves and lairs and prisons with no astoundingly risky turn - the highs are even higher than the lows seem lower. Let me tell you, everyone will be googling \"Mission Impossible 8 submarine scene\" a week for now.The underwater chapter is indeed breathtaking and quite original piece of filmmaking and a nice addition to M:I franchise which saves the movie big time. That 20-minute sequence with submarine is perhaps the most original piece of action written for action-oriented narratives since 1996's Mission: Impossible's own aqua cafe sequence between Ethan and Kittdridge, directed brilliantly by Brian De Palma. The suspense as Ethan so assiduously tackled all those aquatic, James Cameron-isque challanges was palpable. The realism and authenticity added the rest.Else, they have recycled tropes all over the place in order to pay homage - the gala which is rendered into a jail before the gathering itself is even exhibited - no fancy cars, garish costumes, stupendous decorum, dances, masks, bluetooth talk, etc. In here. I missed the trains as well.And narratively, there also exists this thing called predictability, and it's here to stay in the movie - the biggest weakness of The Final Reckoning. The movie is, perhaps, the least memorable for its twists - or the lack thereof - when compared to all the other M:I movies in the franchise, probably tied with Mission: Impossible 2. But that's not to say it is bad, or average or even above average - no! It's hella great!!In terms of action-based storytelling as well, this may seem like a step backwards from Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Most scenes, when considering the movie is nearly 3 hours long, is quite limited or superfluous otherwise. But all of that pays off in the final act, trust Mr. Cruise. Because that brings us to the biplane chase sequence."

          "content": "First , let me say that I think it's great that Tom Cruise does his own stunts and has been with this franchise for so long. It's an incredible feat.That said, this movie was beyond ridiculous. The unending exposition, the gushing praise from every single freaking character heaped onto Ethan Hunt like he was the Second Coming, the constant stripping down of Tom Cruise into his skivvies or his bare chest, the ludicrous timing of every impossible aspect of the plan (yes, I know...it's Mission Impossible...but this one takes it to excess) and the weak ass storyline.For instance, I don't quite understand how The Entity chose Gabriel to be its \"protector\"....how or why Gabriel even found out about it, other than being a super villain. Did it ring him up on the phone? Did it meet him in a bar? In an online chat room? Nor does it make sense how Gabriel (and Ethan Hunt) communicate with it. Did the Entity make that box? Did Gabriel with instructions from the entity? How did the Entity communicate with Gabriel to be its protector/ally/whatever without that box to recruit him? Couldn't they have just kept in communicating that way? So dumb.The action sequences were over the top. Tom Cruise jumping out of a plane into arctic waters and immediately being picked up by a submarine crew. Diving down hundreds of feet into an imploded submarine with nary an issue then stripping down (a standard occurrence in this movie) in arctic waters and swimming hundreds of feet back to the surface with absolutely no gear/mask. By the time the biplane sequence appeared onscreen, I was bored. Yes, Tom Cruise we know you like to fly planes, we know you do your own stunts...I didn't need another 40 minutes for you to showcase that.I give this movie three stars for 1) Tom Cruise doing his own stunts 2) The supporting cast who were forced to say some ridiculously cheesy lines and got robbed of more screen time to showcase repeatedly how very important, brave, heroic, necessary Ethan Hunt is to the whole world 3) The Inuit lady who truly deserves a star of her own because she was adorable."

If you liked the Dead Reckoning, then this is definitely one step better than that. Especially the second half of the movie, watch it in biggest Imax possible if that is not available go for Dolby Atmos. There are few scenes which will give you solid goosebumps. I mean there is nothing extraordinary in acting, plot is also easy peasy but Action is top notch. And somehow it felt like this is gonna be the last movie of the franchise. First half goes away in buildup and second half is full of action sequences. For me it's totally worth watching in the theatre."

It's a feast for the eyes with back-to-back action sequences with some real angle work elevating this film and taking it in a fun action film designed to entertain. Tom Cruise does it again with his long pal director Chris McQ and clearly the results speak for itself. The story was averagely good but cohesive to keep the movie afloat as you enjoy his final journey. Ethan Hunt is forever our American spy hero film but he's the best and will always protect those around him."

          "content": "First off, I want to thank the ones who gave me the complimentary early screening tickets, that was very kind. I had the chance to catch Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning ahead of its wide release, and while it's always a treat to preview something early, this particular outing left me with some mixed feelings.Let's start with the obvious: this movie did not age well, and it hasn't even officially released yet. I'm not someone who leans into politics (in fact, I typically avoid it), but even I couldn't help noticing the oddly heavy-handed political undertones. There were clear parallels drawn, perhaps intentionally, to real world figures, like a \"what-if\" scenario imagining Kamala Harris as president. It felt like a veiled political commentary wrapped in an action blockbuster. Every line written for that character came off as forced, almost as if it were part of a campaign pitch rather than a film script. I wouldn't even bring it up if it didn't make up about a quarter of the entire movie. That said, it was at least unintentionally humorous, like watching a more polished, less inebriated version of a fictional Madam President. There's definitely a wishful thinking sentiment baked into it.Now, onto the film itself. As far as Mission: Impossible films go, this one falls somewhere in the middle. It was better than some of the earlier entries in the franchise, but it's weighed down by a few glaring issues. Chief among them: the editing. I don't think I've ever experienced scene transitions this jarring. One moment, you're in a snow covered tundra, and the next - bam! - you're in the jungle. The transitions were abrupt to the point of being mentally disorienting. It felt less like a seamless globe-trotting adventure and more like channel surfing between locations.The action? Fine. The acting? Also fine. Tom Cruise, as always, deserves credit for performing many of his own stunts, which earns the film a few extra points in my book. But overall, it was a \"just fine\" movie. If I had to rate it, I'd land somewhere around a 6 out of 10, and most of that score is out of respect for Cruise's dedication.If you're a longtime fan of the franchise, it's worth seeing just to complete the saga. It does try to tie a bow on Ethan Hunt's story, though whether this is truly a \"final reckoning\" remains to be seen. My guess? We haven't seen the last of him yet.I am Rae Serbeck, I Watch and Review all Movies Large and Small!"

I have been waiting for this movie ever since it was announced as the last movie and if this movie is the end of the franchise, I'm happy about that because this movie rules.Positives for Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025):\nIn many ways, this movie does feel like a grand finale to a long running story that has been going on for 29 years. I like how the movie starts off by making connections to the other movies in a way that feels like we have been leading up to this ending since 1996. This is the movie with the biggest stakes not only for our characters but for the entire world and it makes \"The Entity\" an even bigger threat and possibly the best villain in the entire franchise. Everyone in the cast is giving it their all especially Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. The spy espionage here is by far the best it has ever been in the franchise with some of the most nail-biting tension you will see in a spy movie. The movie is paced expertly well and the movie is almost 3-hours long, but it doesn't feel that long because you're so invested in the journey with these characters. The action is top notch as always in this franchise and this movie has probably some of the best in the franchise. The airplane scene that we have all seen in the marketing is hands down the best stunt work from Tom Cruise in his entire career and the fact that he somehow still alive goes to shows how committed he is to his work in these movie and in Hollywood. And finally, the ending of this movie and this franchise is perfect in every way possible as it closes out all of the arcs for these great characters and their journeys.Overall, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025) was the perfect conclusion to one of the greatest action movie franchise of all time and I am happy to have accepted this mission with everyone in the world."

This one, however, shatters all preconceived notion of what one can expect.The intro is already great, and the references to other past movies enhance the legacy this title holds and makes the experience for the franchises' fans 10 times better. However, things are just getting started. The screenplay is exquisite, and the use of timing to keep the events in chronological order yet giving the spectator the ability to process everything that's happening at a precise moment makes the movie electric and, at the same time, not overwhelming.It is very appreciated the way each location is presented; how despite the multiple scenarios, the aerial shots manage to immerse you into all locations' environments. This is taken to the highest extent in the cold weather scenes.Stunts, once again, are top level all throughout the film. The climax comes on a perfectly executed scene right at the precise time with all-out Ethan classic moment that could only be pulled off by Cruise. And of course a huge shoutout to the production team for the construction of the sets and scenery which definitely doesn't go unnoticed. Nor does the cast, with many well know faces; and the costume design team.All works extraordinarily when put together to wrap up the series in an incredible manner."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible, a franchise that has been synonymous with big-screen spectacle for nearly 30 years, is back with its latest entry, Dead Reckoning Part One. The film features Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, risking life, limb, and the fates of millions in pursuit of stopping The Entity, an evil A. I. introduced in 2023's Dead Reckoning. While Rogue Nation and Fallout have captured the combination of go-for-broke practical stunts, grinning self-awareness, and just the right touch of believability that make up the most important parameters for a successful IMF mission, Dead Reckoning misses by a wider margin.The Final Reckoning, however, has gone farther afield. The film is extremely sober, veering into melodrama whenever there is story to be told. The cast, consisting of familiar franchise faces and newcomer cameos, whisper-talk their way through soap-opera levels of tension. Nearly every scrap of dialogue is invested in no less than the end of all life on the planet. The message is the most dire and serious thing, introduced by Dead Reckoning: The Entity as a villain capable of literally every bad thing imaginable. Absurdly astronomical stakes are one of the biggest issues with The Final Reckoning. A good-old fashioned nuke or biological weapon - those live in Mission: Impossible's sweet spot: life-and-death at a massive scale, while also being real enough to be relatably scary. But all life on planet Earth is just too much to plausibly wrap your head around, particularly with how seriously everyone takes everything else compared to say, Rogue Nation or Fallout. The Final Reckoning is impossible to review out of the context of the other seven Missions: Impossible films, which is why I keep recapping my feelings for the franchise as a whole. One callback that I really did enjoy was William Donloe (Rolf Saxon), the poor man working in the CIA black vault whose nose Ethan stole the NOC list out from under way back in the '90s. His part in The Final Reckoning is spot on. He's a meaningful character for Ethan and the IMF to encounter who also speaks to the themes of the movie: Our lives are the sum of our choices. However, there are some things The Final Reckoning very much did right. The action is predictably excellent, with the highlight being Ethan's infiltration of the Sevastopol, the MacGuffin of a submarine that sank at the start of Dead Reckoning. The fight choreography is also elevated from previous entries, as other countries send their most special forces after the same prize Ethan is after. The fights are a little more brutal and legitimately feel like the IMF could lose. At this point in the franchise, that's a difficult tightrope to walk, and McQuarrie and Cruise deserve a lot of credit for that.Lastly, The Final Reckoning deserves a fair bit of credit bringing the team together again. The climax of The Final Reckoning gives every team member a job, reminiscent of Fallout in that respect, and very important for the IMF. An abiding trust in his team is part of Ethan's allure, as well as being, as Shea Whigham's Jasper Briggs puts it in Dead Reckoning, a mind-reading, shape-shifting incarnation of chaos. The Final Reckoning is a thrilling and entertaining movie that tries to deal with the end of every living thing on the planet. The movie's climactic biplane sequence is impressive, with Tom Cruise's stunt double walking out on the wing of the plane. However, the movie's subtitle, \"Final Reckoning,\" may not be the best or worst subtitle for the movie. The movie may have missed the mark on the \"Final\" part of the equation, and its messy and self-serious capstone may be the perfect subtitle for the franchise.The franchise has been a juggernaut for 30 years, and the movie's mission now is to take the clean slate created with all the threads tied up and return to what it does best: not take itself too seriously. While the action is reliably thrilling and some of its most exciting sequences are sure to hold up over the years, the somber tone and melodramatic dialogue miss the mark of what has made the franchise so much fun for 30 years. The door is left open for more impossible missions and the hope that this self-serious reckoning isn't actually final."

Starts off in the typical Mission Impossible fashion and I still think it works all these years later. Some say Tom Cruise is the last big action movie star and I would have to agree with that because he continues to push the boundaries in these action sequences. I found myself getting anxiety as the big action scenes unfolded. I really enjoyed how they tied the past movies into this installment and brought characters from the past back. What I liked was if you hadn't seen any of the other films you wouldn't have been lost because they do A LOT of explaining in this movie. Does the Entity work as the \"villain\" in this installment of the franchise? I think so for the most part. As usual the supporting cast works well with Tom Cruise's character. Some of the stuff that didn't work for me was Hayley Atwell she felt very stiff when she was on screen. As I previously stated there is a lot of explaining in this film especially at the beginning. Run time was a little long I think they could have tightened it up in some in the first part of the movie. Does this feel like the final Mission Impossible movie? Yes and no cause they definitely leave the door open for another one. Especially if this one makes a ton of money. The big question remaining now is should you rush out to see this and that's a hell yeah you should! This needs to be seen in the movie theater!

Following the events of Dead Reckoning, Ethan Hunt and his IMF team go on their last mission together to save the world from imminent danger due to the Entity, a lethal villain in the form of AI. No Mission movie is complete without death-defying stunts, and Tom Cruise, as usual, hit it out of the park with his creative partner Christopher McQuarrie, who made us feel Ethan's fear while holding our breath with each stunt. The movie also pays homage to the previous sequels, and the storyline fits perfectly with the chain of events. The cinematography, soundtrack, and twists are outstanding. In my opinion, the film is the perfect send-off to the Mission: Impossible franchise, which will always be the greatest spy series for action enthusiasts. Thank you, Tom and McQ!"

The action in the film is stellar. The ending of the film will make you squirm in your chair. And I saw it in IMAX. Highly recommended to see it in this format.The film ties all loose ends from previous films. We meet characters from previous films and you see them as they look today and where do they fit in the film. And they aren't shoehorned into the narrative. It's organic to the storytelling.Go see this film. It's a nice send off to this film franchise. If in fact it is the last film. 🤣"

The script is laughably bad, filled with clunky exposition and dialogue that sounds like it was written by an AI on autopilot. The pacing is all over the place; racing through action for the sake of spectacle, then grinding to a halt with scenes that add nothing to the plot.And yes, Cruise runs. Everywhere. On rooftops, through airports, inside a submarine. It's exhausting and absurd. The plot is recycled from earlier entries, with nothing new to say, just a string of convenient coincidences stitched together to keep things moving.If you're hoping for tension, depth, or innovation, look elsewhere. This is three hours of loud, lazy filmmaking. Skip it."

This one is just a self indiulging glorification of Tom Cruise, by Tom Cruise, focused on Tom Cruise as a god, a super hero, an \"entity\" (absolutely childish and juvenile name). It starts off with a personal message from Ton Cruise to the audience (geez, thanks Tom), then launches into clips of Tom Cruise from all the previous movies, just being AMAZING!!!!! Apparently. This is why a brain surgeon should not be the patient, the operating surgeon, the anaesthetist, the surgical assistant and the theatre nurse. It doesn't end well and it will not age well being the main actor and superstar, the writer, director, producer and choreographer. You need a bit of perspective and not get drunk and intoxicated on your own kool aid. The movie should have been entitled the final flashback. This movie was all about the flashbacks. Probably not less than 50. How can you justify that in a non Bollywood blockbuster?? Pathetic ending by a great actor."

Also, if this is meant to be the final movie, why does it not present a feeling of finality?

And it did not disappoint.From the very first frame, it's clear: the filmmakers have mastered the art of opening a film. This is more than just another action-packed blockbuster-it's a heartfelt tribute and a powerful send-off to one of cinema's most iconic franchises. After nearly 30 years, Mission: Impossible found a way to end with grace, guts, and grit.Tom Cruise proves once again he's allergic to comfort zones. He gives everything to this role, and while Ethan Hunt might be \"getting too old for this,\" the man still sprints like retirement is chasing him. And lucky for us, not one but two full-throttle sprinting scenes make the cut. You can practically hear his life insurance company sweating.The airplane sequence alone? Absolutely bonkers. One of the most jaw-dropping stunts I've ever seen. We go from dry land to 500 feet below sea level, to airspace above the South African jungle-and somehow it all works. The stakes couldn't be higher, and yet the biggest obstacle isn't just the villain. It's us. Our inability to stop fighting among ourselves adds a painful layer of realism to the chaos.And Benji-oh, Benji. The real hero of this story. He's not just the comic relief anymore; he's the heart. The emotional weight he carries in this film is surprising and deeply moving. When the torch is passed, it doesn't feel forced. It feels earned. And that matters.But what I truly loved was the film's deeper message:A single choice doesn't define your life-it's the culmination of all your choices.We see Ethan confront ghosts from his past and discover that the things he thought were his biggest regrets... weren't always as bad as he believed. Sometimes, the people we think hate us for our decisions don't even carry that weight anymore-or they're even grateful. That reconciliation hits hard.This film avoids the easy trap of nostalgia. It honors its legacy without drowning in \"member berries.\" It's a bookend that respects the journey we've taken, acknowledges the cost, and says goodbye without begging for tears. Life, after all, goes on without Ethan Hunt. And that's okay.The Final Reckoning is a cinematic ride of insane stunts, heartfelt moments, and philosophical reflection. It's everything a finale should be: bold, emotional, thrilling, and unapologetically epic.Go see this film. You've earned it.And so has Ethan."

Never mind that Luther has never seen the drive and the source code contained within, but he is able to create a perfect fitting USD stick with a soldering iron and a magnifying glass.Prompt contd.> Mr. Cruise will insert the drive in the hard disk while hanging from a Cessna, and it will get uploaded into a server in the heart of a mountain without wifi or any kind of connection.Prompt contd.> The server room with all the world's collected knowledge will have its doors open with no one to stop anyone who wants to get in.Prompt contd.> Add a scene where a man shot in the belly gives instructions to a pickpocket to cut the green wire, the blue wire, but never the red wire.Prompt contd.> Sprinkle vacuous but bombastic sounding sentences such as \"It is written\" and \"It is not written\".Prompt contd.> End the 3h long movie with an Ocean's Trilogy kinda ending where everyone comes together separately in a public square, looks at each other with meaningful glances, and walks away separately.All the sarcasm aside, I was only partially bored, so I guess it was not a total failure. But, I didn't care for any of the characters. I feel more feelings when watching \"The Last of Us\" than watching MI series which peaked at #1 and then went downhill for the subsequent 7 sequels (all of which I saw)"

Does it work? The fanservice was delivered. Unexpected family ties, key subjects and events from past films, as well as characters who haven't been around for a bunch of years seem to add up to a single picture (no, they don't add up, they're just mentions under literally stills from previous parts)While watching, I caught myself thinking that somewhere in the middle I was staring and literally 0 events happened in an hour. It seems like the characters are doing something and there are tons of conversations, but no action.Yes, Kukuruz will fly on a cornfield at the end, but there is nothing else interesting in the film.If it weren't for these incomprehensible flashbacks and the realization that there won't be a sequel, then this is a very weak 6, and since the situation is different, you can add an extra point."

          "content": "Many times every year movies will come out that critics will shame several factors about, but when I see it, I find these \"faults\" to actually be positives. Final Reckoning has been criticized for exposition dialogue, a lackluster villain and not enough comedy. I can easily counter these, and I did while watching the film, which flew by and held my interest in every single scene.The Mission Impossible movies have rarely been about drama between characters. Dialogue is about the mission and making sure that not only the audience, but the agents all being on the same page about what needs to be done. It's more about the action than the spying. It's more popcorn flick! Comedy is also something it has mostly lacked, especially in the first film, which this one really harkens back to. I have never really found any of the films funny other than some natural moments, and this one is no exception. Finally, the villain being an underwhelming Gabriel isn't quite correct. The Dead Reckoning sets up how AI can coerce different people to each have their own agenda to be on their right side of the situation, whether they believe the entity can be defeated, reasoned with, or is faking it. Gabriel happens to be a character in a position of being highly tied to the entity and coerced by it, but isn't the villain. The villain is the climate surrounding the global threat and the decisions that it forces individuals to make. Final Reckoning really follows the other films in the series with its structure and correctly does so with a bit more dread, while having hope. A bad situation, e.g. Getting fired from your job, could be the best thing that happened to you.Exposition and flashbacks can drag a story down, but in this case, the editing is done without missing a beat. Did I personally need the flashbacks, no, but they didn't interrupt the story. The action still feels fresh and has some standout sequences that really grip the audience. I never felt like there was nostalgia, but that the callbacks to other impossible missions fit in line with the story that was being told which is really about trusting humans. Getting back to the analogue basics of a simpler life."

If you likes the prior film 'dead reckoning' there is a good chance you will like this one.This film has similar problems as the last, its story is grossly convoluted and relies heavily on dialogue to explain what exactly is going on. Over and over and over again the story, the plans and the characters are explained to the audience through long out of place scenes of heavy dialogue. It's not an effective way to develop plot. It's really confusing and hard to follow. Long gone are the days when mission impossible was simple and clever. It has gotten lost in its own heartless, convoluted mess. This film perhaps suffers worse than the last in that it tries to wraps up 30 years of films. Why did they feel the need to connect the dots of 7 previous films into one? It is so hard to follow and doesn't actually provide any satisfaction to the franchise, just further confuses the audience. The plot of the film is a mess. The action sequences are fantastic (better than number 7) but feel somewhat empty due to the lack of understanding around WHY things are happening. Stiff dialogue is NOT enough to perpetuate plot. The one rule in story telling that they are chronically ignoring is 'show Dont tell'"

And what was Gabriel's background? Why did he kill the woman Ethan was close to? Who was she? How did Ethan not go after Gabriel to avenge her death and what has Gabriel been doing all this time (that could be an extended MI universe movie)? Gabriel now sirens more time running AWAY from Ethan than engaging him... Why wouldn't he engage with Ethan so that he gets his hands on the hard drive rather constantly saying it's written that Ethan will hand it over to him?!Major plot hole concerning Luther... Did I miss it or why wasn't it explained what his health issue was and how it happened?How did Luther design the hardware to defeat The Entity when he nor Ethan never saw it?Also the constant 'Only you Ethan can do this' mantra repeated over and over again was ridiculous.If I'm guarding the vault that had all the world's knowledge in it and it is so secure it can survive atomic attacks why would I abandon it versus staying inside it with whoever I want to be with - after all it was clear anyone could get inside of it)?The stunts inside the submarine were great... The airplane stunts were very over the top. Ethan runs in this one but not as much as the previous two movies.There should have been a better effort to focus on plot development and not add so many characters and tying in all the previous movies to this one.

And the same with how Avengers Infinity War is sometimes considered better than End Game, Dead Reckoning also could be better than Final Reckoning, but both prequels had way too many questions to answer. The Final Reckoning answers them, mostly, with added, unexpected storylines from the past movies. I think it's more cerebral than the last one and gave the characters more time to bond. More feels. Great movie. I hope they make more."

Does anyone say NO to Tom Cruise? Most of the real reviews here cover the issues with the film, the over explaining of the story, why? Why are the actors being forced to look like an infomercial? Did it test poorly, the only solution is to have all the scenes dumbed down to a 50IQ?Someone should re-edit this film as it's meant to be. An action film without saying The Entity, 10,000 times. So Boring. My eyes still hurt.And the emotional arcs, whether it was the way they were shot, but the concept of actors holding back the tears to let the audience feel something would have been preferred then watching grown men tear up so much. It was silly. And laughable. More Expendables than MI.I've always loved Tom Cruise, but I have no idea what happened to this story, and you know a little something called: plot...Is it really a good idea to shoot ALL your action sequences then do a wrap around story after the fact? This goes way beyond \"we'll fix it in post,\" how about \"fix it in prep.\" How about \"write a script!\"And the depression and sadness I feel after watching this bloated Frankenstein, piece mealed story. Honestly, Hollywood owes it to us to give 25 new filmmakers a shot for the same budget as this ridiculous abomination. EVERYTHING, well almost everything, that is wrong with Hollywood and making movies, is in this film. Mission Wasted Impossible. Saddest movie I've seen in a long time."

I'm all for a bit of make believe in film and the MI series have been superb at stretching the believable. This was over the top and completely unbelievable.

It appears Tom Cruise was determined to execute every possible stunt, leaving little room for anything else. The absence of space action is conspicuous; I assume budget limitations prevented it, or he surely would have gone there. I particularly appreciated the subtle connections to the first film.What to expect: Prepare for an exhilarating experience with countless thrilling sequences. You won't need an adrenaline shot - the movie provides it! I'm also curious if there are cut scenes that might be released later.On the downside: The sheer volume of action can be overwhelming. Furthermore, all plot points are explicitly laid out for the audience, lacking a more subtle or intelligent narrative approach. It's almost like an anime with characters constantly explaining their roles. On a positive note, a new team seems to be established, hinting at promising future installments."

The plot cleverly ties his past actions to the formation of The Entity, the Skynet-like threat he first encountered in 2023 (assisted by the nigh omnipotent and unfortunately early departing this time around Esai Morales aka Gabriel), and it's turning society into a tribal chaos of disinformation eeriely mirrors our own in 2025. But aside from a hilarious callback to the agent who was restationed to Alaska in the first MI (and even that joke wears out its welcome thanks to the thudding script), the film staggers under the weight of its profundity, characters unwinding long blank-faced speeches of exposition and Ethan's importance as if AI were already running the show. Hayley Atwell, Ving, Simon Pegg...the wonderful gang is there, but the quick change fun, spycraft, and undercover thrills of what made the series enjoyable in the first place are pretty much gone. Haley learning to ride sled dogs and the nod to Top Gun with his landing a plane on the aircraft carrier was cute (surprised they didn't include scenes of him shooting pool, racing a Nascar and protesting a war for good measure), but other than one last 'look what Tom can still do at sixty-three' rounding of the bases, this is an overlong, over plotted, dire entry for an already dire year in a franchise that probably should have wrapped up two sequels ago."

I have been a fan of his since I saw him in \"Risky Business\" back in 1983. Since then he has starred in many great movies like \"Legend\", \"Top Gun\", \"The Color of Money\", \"Rain Man\", \"Born on the Fourth of July\", \"Days of Thunder\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"The Firm\", \"Eyes Wide Shut\", and \"Top Gun Maverick\". And I think he should have won the Oscar for best actor for \"Jerry Maguire\".He gives a great performance here, as charasmatic a leading man as ever. The story is silly and preposterous and unbelievable. But you don't watch a movie like this for the story but for the great action scenes. And this really is a terrific action movie. As action adventure movies go, I would say this isn't as good as the Indiana Jones movies but better than most James Bond movies.It is a long movie at two hours and forty nine minutes but it is very entertaining all the way through. The cinematography is very good, as is the quality of the sound and the film editing. The music is dramatic and effective.Overall a great moviegoing experience.I think this is the best movie of the year so far. Very enjoyable."

The movie can feel like a bit of a chore in its first act as it does take its time to do some catching up, but once the story gets going it never stops. The story throughout feels just as important as the mission and I personally loved how the storytelling for the antagonist focuses on every film and how Hunt's choices have led up to this moment. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames' 'Benji' and 'Luther' are always a pleasure to watch bounce off of Cruise's 'Ethan Hunt' and their dynamic combined with some heavy moments from Angela Bassett, gives the film an emotional backbone strong enough to carry the weight of everything leading up to this final installment. Crazy stunts, beautiful cinematography, deep cut callbacks, and so much more, 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' offers everything that made it's predecessors special and serves as a truly meaningful farewell to a franchise I hold close to my heart. This is yet another testament to why we go to the movies and why I will never miss a 'Mission: Impossible' movie, even if the world was on the line. Last mission or not, Tom Cruise was born to be the IMF's most trusted operative."

Awful pacing, dull and meanders dialogue that often goes nowhere nor build-up to something, a completely dull villain and threat. And worse of all.. what is the point in a movie that constantly tells you exactly how it is going to go? And by virtue of being what it is, there is absolutely no mystery about its conclusion. Not playing with a viewer's expectation is NOT a requirement in storytelling.. but you have to give them something! A bit of tension and intrigue.It's a shame because I can see what it wanted to achieve with its premise, but it feels stuck in the past while trying to use more modern tropes.Still, it is entertaining enough, and provides spectacle-scenes so incredible anyone would be hard pressed to replicate them in such quality. The cast is okay, the locations good, great production, visuals and cinematography.But a film has to be more than a few set pieces and scenes.. it has to work as a whole and be more than the sum of its parts.It's a fact that not all revious entries have been stellar.

Alas, arrogance and stupidity have kept them on the road to ruin. But as long as we have Tom Cruise, there'll be at least one true movie star who knows that his job is to entertain his customers.'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning' isn't a perfect movie, and it's not even the best film in the series (That would be 'Fallout' in my opinion). At over two and a half hours, it's too bloated for its own good. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings', and the story here can't support that kind of run time. Less is more, but the last two entries have set themselves up as the saga's swansong, so it's understandable why they were fooled into thinking they needed things to feel more \"epic\".The first act here is a bit of a slog, and the second act is a bit turgid, but the finale offers a brilliant, white-knuckle action sequence that only Tom Cruise can deliver. Married with the good will this series and its characters have built up, it's a solid enough send-off that we'll likely look back on in a decade or so and say \"Man, they sure don't make 'em like that anymore.\"."

          "content": "\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\": A Thrilling, Yet Exhausting, Finale\n\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" arrives with the weight of expectation, not just as the latest installment in a beloved franchise, but as the purported grand finale to Ethan Hunt's incredible journey. And while it undeniably delivers on the series' hallmark of breathtaking stunts and relentless action, it also shows signs of a franchise reaching its limits, for better or worse.Picking up directly from \"Dead Reckoning Part One,\" the film thrusts Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, as committed as ever) and his IMF team into a race against time to neutralize \"The Entity,\" a rogue, sentient AI threatening to plunge the world into nuclear chaos. This formidable new antagonist, combined with the return of Gabriel (Esai Morales), a mysterious figure from Ethan's past, attempts to bring together decades of narrative threads, aiming for a truly comprehensive conclusion.The action sequences are, as always, the undeniable highlight. From an astonishing underwater sequence aboard a sunken submarine to exhilarating aerial stunts involving biplanes, \"The Final Reckoning\" consistently pushes the boundaries of practical effects and human daring. Tom Cruise's dedication to performing his own death-defying feats remains unparalleled, and it's a genuine marvel to witness. Director Christopher McQuarrie continues to choreograph these elaborate set pieces with a masterful hand, ensuring every explosion, every chase, every near-miss lands with maximum impact.The supporting cast, including Hayley Atwell's cunning Grace, Simon Pegg's ever-reliable Benji, and Ving Rhames' steadfast Luther, provide crucial moments of levity and emotional anchor. Henry Czerny's return as Kittridge, alongside Angela Bassett as President Sloane, adds a welcome layer of governmental intrigue.However, where \"The Final Reckoning\" occasionally falters is in its narrative density. The plot, while ambitious in its scope to tie together elements from previous films, can feel overly convoluted at times. The constant ticking clocks and interconnected threats, while designed to escalate tension, can lead to a certain fatigue. There are moments where the sheer number of double-crosses and exposition-heavy explanations threaten to overshadow the visceral thrills. While the film attempts to inject poignant emotional beats and nostalgic nods, the sheer spectacle sometimes overtakes genuine character development. The villain, Gabriel, despite his critical role, could have benefited from a deeper exploration of his connection to Ethan.Ultimately, \"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" is a rollercoaster ride of epic proportions. It's a testament to Tom Cruise's unwavering dedication and Christopher McQuarrie's visionary direction that even with its occasional narrative stumbles, the film remains an incredibly entertaining and visually stunning experience. While it aims for a definitive ending, the film leaves just enough room for speculation, proving that the mission, for Ethan Hunt, might truly be impossible to conclude.Verdict: A high-octane, visually spectacular, if occasionally overstuffed, finale that delivers the adrenaline-pumping action fans have come to expect from the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise. A worthy send-off for Ethan Hunt, even if the \"final reckoning\" feels a little less \"final\" than advertised."

It fell short in my opinion. I wanted it to be great, but it just wasn't. I watched a review on YouTube, and the reviewer called the movie \"convoluted.\" I think that's the best way to describe this movie. There's so much going on that it's hard to follow. They tried to connect a lot of the previous movies, but it jumbled the movie up too much. I also think it relies so much on previous movies that if you haven't seen them recently, it's hard to keep up. There are several characters that play a role but aren't explained very well, and that muddied the story up in my opinion, too. The pacing is weird as well. It seemed too slow to me at times. Don't get me wrong, there are moments where it's incredibly tense, and the action is very good at times. I just wasn't on the edge of my seat the entire time like I was with the previous two movies. I also wasn't crazy about the ending, but I know others were fine with it. With all that being said, it's still a solid movie. Like I mentioned already, the action is really good at times, and there were some really tense scenes. I also liked how they used some characters from previous movies. If you're a fan of this series, you have to see it. Just don't go in with the highest of expectations. If you're not a fan of the series and are just looking for a solid movie, I'd still\nrecommend it."

And is what saved the movie!On that note, the first half is so slow!! Made the movie almost the worst one of the franchise, good thing the second half kicked in!The franchise was getting better and better after each installment, the first half didn't do that, made me think, what are we doing?! This is how you want to end the franchise!!!!The first 20-30mins of the film felt rushed and confusing, they were going beat to beat for the plot. For Ex, tells Ethan to go somewhere, cuts to him there. Than 3 mins later he's somewhere else. They really wanted the plot to start, even though we had a part 1 to tell us everything we needed to know.The quality from Part 1 and Part 2 are different, if you watched them back to back you won't enjoy it. They don't fully play off each other, just the plot threads connect them. Almost like they didn't know where to go after part 1!Movie felt like it Wasted moments while still giving us the ending we needed.But needed to be way better for an ending and a part 2!!!!!"

Great cinematography throughout and the score was decent. Obviously some brilliant stunts like every other MI film. However, the acting of Esai Morales playing Gabriel was significantly worse in comparison so the dead reckoning. I felt the character was a weak villain in comparison so that of Solomon Lane and the character played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Also, the chemistry between Grace and Ethan feels forced in comparison to that of Ethan and Ilsa in previous films. Definitely worth a watch and a nice way to end what has been an incredible franchise of movies!"

And then they completely ruin it with absolutely terrible Edits in that Second Half of the Submarine Scene.🤔The Plane Scene was Okay at best. Again we've seen far better scenes. The Train Segment in Dead Reckoning from Moment to Moment was so good to experience. The Burj Khalifa Scene in Ghost Protocol was better than anything in Final Reckoning. The Hayley Atwell Escape and transition to The Yellow Car segment and transition to the Oncoming Train in Dead Reckoning was better than anything in Final Reckoning."

It's just kind of weird, the thing Cruise has for brunettes.Every action scene is boring and dragged out too long. It's like they made everything ultra-impossible, but at the end, you know Cruise will overcome it all and win, so it's boring.It's time for Cruise to move on and maybe reboot this.

They had all the necessary elements for an epic action thriller. Plenty of twists/surprises/etc., but this is one of the rare occasions where the acting/cinematography/stunts and the myriad of really cool stuff like nuclear aircraft carriers, submarines, fighter jets, Marine One, and all the other things that went into the film made the story better. Usually, the story is the ceiling, but not this time.Acting ~ ⭐ 8.5/10\nTom Cruise is top-notch. He didn't become the biggest actor in the world because he can run fast and look good on camera. He's really good at his craft. The genre limited his performance, but he maximized his arena. His supporting actors did great, but it was the bit actors I noticed lacked a little. Small roles, but they could have figured that out too. His supporting actors with big roles did fine, especially the leading female.Cinematography ~ ⭐ 9/10\nThis film is a massive spectacle that is beautifully captured. The images were immersive, and the cinematography was one of the film's best qualities. The action scenes were killer, and the underwater scenes were mind-boggling. But it was the in-flight sequences that were unbelievably good.Commentary: Tom Cruise is a bad dude who deserves much respect. His scale and abilities are hard to comprehend. This movie is a must-watch in theaters. Not only is Cruise the biggest movie star alive, but he's also done a ton for the film industry, and you can tell he loves it. I have friends who've worked with him, and they absolutely rave about him, especially his on-set leadership. I'm astonished by his capabilities, longevity, and the scale of his thinking. This guy is a national treasure.P. S. Make sure to clip your nails before you see this movie, otherwise you'll chew them off."

Only one man and his foxy female sidekick can save the world from disaster.No, this isn't a misplaced review for Terminator 3. But if you've seen T3, you might find this film somewhat familiar. Equally, there are plot segments and indeed entire scenes lovingly lifted from the Abyss, the Hunt for Red October, Top Gun (that's allowed), the Sum of all Fears and more than a dozen other films. Count them as you go. Barely a scene went by that I didn't find myself thinking: I've definitely seen this before.And the plot itself is complete nonsense. Maguffin #1, which has been stolen by the bad guy, needs to be paired with Maguffin #2, which is on a sunken sub, in order to trap Skynet in Maguffin #3 and stop it destroying the world. Why Skynet wants to destroy the world is never adequately explained, but presumably has something to do with repopulating the world with shiny metal robots. And all of this depends on Skynet - a computer program sufficiently sophisticated that it can hack the entire world - being so completely predictable in its actions that it seems the entire world has figured out exactly what it's going to do and when. Go figure.In any case, each set piece is preceded by an explanation of what's about to happen that makes it abundantly clear that Tom Cruise is definitely going to die this time - but then I guess it wouldn't be called Mission Impossible if the missions were, in fact, possible. Or even plausible.Alongside these plot expositions are a number of attempts at emotional scenes that are designed to convey just how much Tommy cares about his mates...which is more than can be said for us. Even the normally brilliant Simon Pegg and Hayley Atwell seem to exist here only as scene partners and plot movers, which feels like a missed opportunity. Pom Klemetieff is entertaining, and Tramell Tillman offers some amusement as a sub captain, but that's about it....however......if you can make it past the incoherent plot, the constant ripping-off of other movies, the impenetrable exposition, the lack of emotional engagement and the sheer absurdity of the situation......the action sequences are amazing, and probably worth the admission price alone."

Hunt and associates have to find analog ways to complete their mission of corrupting the Entity's source code and destroy it forever.Acting:\nPerformances are good, Tom Cruise has still got it and is very compelling in his most famous role. The supporting cast are also strong and add to the story.Conclusion:\nA decent end to the franchise but definitely not one of the best MI movies.5/10."

Also there was almost continuous explaining about what they were doing to do next to defeat the AI dark force. I was almost more confused after they explained than before.The nearly 3 hr length did not help this movie. If it were 1/2 shorter it would have been a better flick imo. Also, there were some great underutilized characters here. More of them and less explaining would have been nice.Still, big action and explosions and a great biplane sequence.

But this time, there's something more. Not only does the film deliver on the franchise's signature thrills, it also offers a surprising degree of clarity and emotional resonance, making it one of the most accessible-and satisfying-installments in the series.Where previous entries often tangled viewers in a web of double-crosses and shifting loyalties, The Final Reckoning simplifies its objective without sacrificing depth. The narrative feels more streamlined, a welcome change that lets the characters and action take center stage. It's easier to follow, but not simplistic-and that balance pays off.Parallels with Avengers: Infinity War are inevitable. Like that film, The Final Reckoning serves as both a culmination and a retrospective. Long-running themes and character arcs find resolution, some poignant, others hard-earned. It recontextualizes the entire series, encouraging longtime fans to revisit earlier missions with fresh eyes. Don't be surprised if a definitive boxed set is just around the corner.Notably, the film avoids one of the franchise's familiar tropes: the last-minute reveal that the IMF team had anticipated everything. Gone is the sudden switch from apparent failure to triumphant twist. Instead, the tension is real, the stakes are palpable, and the villain-arguably the most formidable yet-proves a genuine match for Ethan Hunt and his team.By the film's close, viewers are left with a provocative question: Is this the end of the road for these heroes, or simply the end of a chapter? Can the next generation carry the torch, or is saving the world still, as the IMF calls it, \"Monday\"?Whatever comes next, The Final Reckoning secures its place as both a thrilling action film and a thoughtful finale. It doesn't just wrap up a story-it reminds us why we came along for the ride in the first place."

          "content": "\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" isn't just a great action movie; it's a phenomenal culmination of a franchise that has consistently delivered high-octane thrills and surprisingly deep character work. Director Christopher McQuarrie masterfully brings the two-part saga to a close, delivering a film that is both epic in scope and intimately personal for Ethan Hunt and his IMF team.From the opening moments, the film grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go. The action sequences are, as expected, breathtakingly inventive and executed with a visceral realism that few franchises can match. Tom Cruise, ever the dedicated craftsman, throws himself into stunts that defy logic, elevating the spectacle to a new level. However, \"The Final Reckoning\" is far more than just a collection of impressive set pieces.What truly elevates this installment is its emotional core. The stakes feel higher than ever, not just for the world, but for the relationships Ethan has forged over the years. The film delves deeper into the bonds between the IMF team - Luther, Benji, and Ilsa (whose presence is deeply felt) - adding layers of tension and vulnerability to their seemingly impossible missions. New additions to the cast seamlessly integrate, bringing fresh dynamics and challenges to the group.The narrative, while complex and intricate, is expertly handled, tying up loose ends from \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" while forging a satisfying and impactful conclusion. The exploration of artificial intelligence as a formidable and morally ambiguous antagonist feels particularly relevant and adds a layer of intellectual intrigue to the relentless action.Visually, the film is stunning. From exotic locales to claustrophobic close-quarters combat, the cinematography is dynamic and immersive, enhancing the thrill and tension of every scene. The score is equally effective, amplifying the emotional beats and driving the pulse-pounding action.\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" delivers on every promise it makes. It's a spectacular action film, a gripping spy thriller, and a deeply satisfying conclusion to Ethan Hunt's current journey. It's a testament to the enduring power of practical filmmaking, compelling storytelling, and the unwavering dedication of its star and creative team. This is a must-see cinematic event that will leave audiences breathless and emotionally invested until the very last frame."

If one of you didn't had the opportunity to see it yet and you read my comment to make yourself an option...save your money and wait for it when it will go on streaming. You will lose 3h of your life , your money and you will get nothing in return.

          "content": "Hes done it again.Sure! Here's a concise review of the Mission: Impossible film series, focusing on its essence as a franchise. If you meant a specific installment, let me know.---Review: Mission: Impossible (Franchise)The Mission: Impossible series, anchored by Tom Cruise's relentless performance as Ethan Hunt, is one of Hollywood's most enduring and consistently entertaining action franchises. Blending espionage, high-stakes drama, and jaw-dropping stunts, each installment ups the ante both technically and narratively.From Brian De Palma's suspenseful 1996 original to Christopher McQuarrie's sleek, explosive modern entries (Fallout, Dead Reckoning), the franchise has evolved into a spectacle of globe-trotting chaos with a surprisingly emotional core. Cruise's commitment to performing his own stunts adds a visceral authenticity-be it hanging off planes, scaling the Burj Khalifa, or free-falling from helicopters.While some plotlines lean on formula, the slick editing, smart direction, and charismatic ensemble cast keep the series fresh. What elevates Mission: Impossible is not just the action, but the tension, loyalty, and the question it always poses: how far will one man go to save the world?Verdict: A pulse-pounding masterclass in modern action cinema that continues to redefine its limits.---Would you like a version tailored for social media, an academic analysis, or a fan blog post?"

It offers nothing new in terms of story, character development, or emotional depth. The action sequences, though well-executed, couldn't compensate for the weak plot and predictable direction. While I respect Tom Cruise's legacy and commitment to the genre, perhaps it's time to explore fresher ideas or step back from roles that feel outdated. Overall, it was a disappointing experience that felt like a rehash of previous films. I expected much more."

Having said that, the opening- again - was a masterpiece: fast, entertaining, suspenseful. What followed thereafter was 1 hour too long. They just stretched the final action scene endlessly and the White House/ Pentagon scenes were too pompous and too long. One could have made the film so much better and more entertaining by cutting A LOT of scenes. However the movie was still fun, but by far not the best of the series. All actors were excellent, the action scenes were the stars, as usual. Unfortunately many dialogues sounded like the were written by \"the entity\" aka KI."

You want to accept them but the more you think about the plot they are a COMPLETE waste of time. I am really aggravated by how STUPID the whole STORY is. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND how critics are covering the WEAK story by saying it is CONVOLUTED. No my friends, this movie is a waste of time if you try to take it seriously. First, there is no REASON to the RACE AGAINST time which is generated by the DANGER of Nuclear Annihilations. If the Entity has already control of most of the Nuclear arsenals IT CAN trigger the Nuclear War by itself. There is no need to take over of ALL the nuclear arsenals to trigger an nuclear war, it is enough to start it. Right? Second, we find out that there is a way to disconnect the arsenal from the digital control. Why isn't this done in the first place? Third, this impossible mission doesn't require any secrecy because as we can see the president of the US supports the idea to destroy the Entity. Therefore, it is not only Ethan who needs to do it, it can be a whole army going for accomplishing it. The whole point of the \"world is dependent on Ethan success\" doesn't make sense. Fourth, the fact that the Russians don't know where their submarine was destroyed is simply idiotic. They have to come to the same place as Ethan goes in order to find out, this way another 30 minutes of movie is wasted in a completely unnecessary fight with the Russians. Fifth, the annihilation of the Entity is based on the IDIOTIC fact that Ethan and the crew knows where the Entity will try to survive the nuclear war. It is for low IQ individuals to believe that an cyber entity who can be everywhere will go into only one place, it will not have any way to duplicate and that place and a very specific time will be know by anyone. There are also idiotic relationships, such as the Inuit who doesn't speak any English but married for years with an American who considers her \"the love of his life\". One may wonder how did those two people communicate over the years? Please do not spend time and money on this movie. It is a cash grab and such a sloppy effort from the writer should not be rewarded by the audience."

Five minutes into the movie, they do their face mask thing to get to objective one.Now AI has taken over nearly all the Nuclear arsenal of the world, but still wants the US nuclear arsenal for doomsday.All US officials blames Ethan for everything, President Kamla even says, if she press nukes, the blood will be on Ethan hands.So now Ethan and team goes to stop AI. In second half its gets slightly better but at some point you will really consider they push nukes and credits roll. The visuals and acting performance is good and makers have put great efforts in everything except story.It could have worked without that also like previous films, but here a lot of scenes have no dialogue they speak in certain narrator mode, so you know its the last film.Simply put, it looks good, but boring."

The Action (and Anxiety) in these films is INTENSE. Tom Cruise makes a great movie. There are only a handful of Actors that I go to the Theatre to see whatever they are in. Tom Cruise is one of them.I felt like this one had 3 \"Acts\" to it. First Act was reminding you about Ethan and what he's done over the years to set up the movie's story.Then Act 2 is the FREAK OUT ANXIETY that unfolds with the Bad Guys. Lots of crazy action and stunts that are insane. (Cruise has some of the best Stunts in all Movies)\nJust when you think everyone is almost safe, the Final Reckoning of Act 3 has the most Action -holding my breath as I squirm around my theatre Seat- only to have more of the Bad Guys returning for MORE. No spoilers here but if you liked any of these Mission Impossible Films before, you'll love this one. It sure did not seem like almost 3 hours went by!I wish there was more humour from Simon Pegg a he is so great ! I guess you can't be joking as you try to save the World ...Again.Like James Bond, you can't be hanging off of buildings etc when you are 60. It was a fun ride these past 30 years. Thank you !"

          "content": "For decades, Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt has defied death, gravity, and seemingly every conceivable global threat. With \"Mission Impossible: Final Reckoning,\" the franchise doesn't just stick the landing; it shatters the runway in a blaze of glory, delivering a climactic conclusion that is as emotionally resonant as it is viscerally thrilling.Tom Cruise once again doing the impossible, this final installment is a cinematic juggernaut that blends death-defying spectacle, relentless suspense, and even a surprising edge of horror into a high-octane farewell that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible.From the very first sequence, you're thrown into a whirlwind of tension. There's no warm-up. Ethan Hunt is already on the run, already in danger, already faced with impossible choices-and this time, those choices hurt. The film forces Ethan, and the audience, to confront the cost of a lifetime of service, of betrayal, of running toward danger while everyone else runs away.There are scenes where your heart is in your throat-not just from the danger, but from the weight of what's at stake. Characters we've grown with for years are suddenly in peril. Lines are crossed. Sacrifices are made. Every mission feels like it could be their last, and at times, it's devastating. The film doesn't shy away from moments of grief, guilt, and regret. There are choices that Ethan can't unmake, and you feel that in every lingering glance, every desperate sprint.By the time the credits roll, you're not just blown away-you're emotionally exhausted, in the best possible way. Final Reckoning doesn't just send Ethan Hunt out with a bang. It sends him out with a symphony of heartbreak, heroism, and hope that hits harder than any explosion ever could."

          "content": "At long last, the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise has come to a so-called \"end,\" for now at least. We all have memories of gasping as Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) pulls off stunts even more death-defying than the previous movie, being enthralled by the clever and often-intricate spy plots at stake in this franchise, and of course hearing the M:I theme song on the big screen. While not a perfect film by any means, I'm happy to say that this conclusion is both satisfying and ending in ways that M:I fans will appreciate.The film picks up after the end of \"Dead Reckoning,\" with The Entity (the AI villain from that film) causing havoc. Ethan's mission is to put a stop to The Entity, and as anyone would expect from this franchise, that involves traversing the globe and plenty of high-octane action set pieces. At nearly three hours, the film is long, but it doesn't drag. Even the exposition-heavy first 45 minutes is never boring, and does a pretty good job (through both dialogue and flashback scenes) of connecting the events of the previous movies in a way that people who have largely forgotten (at least some of) those movies can still understand and enjoy.Cruise is terrific as Hunt as always, although I could have used a bit more banter and direct work with the rest of the IMF team. Compared to most of the previous movies though, the film is much richer in character development, which of course makes for a more satisfying viewing experience and gives both the plot and its narrative place as a \"conclusion\" much greater emotional weight. The screenplay feels more clever and taut than usual even in spite of all the exposition, which I think is largely because of how some of the character development plays out. The action scenes are jaw-dropping as can be expected, especially a climactic set piece in a national park area in South Africa which rivals the best action scenes ever done in this franchise (which, of course, is really saying something.) And without giving anything further away, the ending is incredibly well-done in a powerful and poignant way that you don't often see from this series. Gladly recommended for fans of the franchise. 8/10Note 1: Here is my updated ranking of the \"Mission: Impossible\" films from best to worst--(1) M:I-Ghost Protocol, (2) M:I, (3) M:I-Rogue Nation, (4) M:I-Fallout, (5) M:I-The Final Reckoning, (6) M:I-Dead Reckoning Part 1, (7) M:I-2, (8) M:I-3.Note 2: I saw the film in The Big Show, Alamo Drafthouse's premium large format screen. The picture and sound quality were excellent. As we all know, these films are truly made to be experienced on the biggest and most immersive screens possible."

          "content": "The franchise succeeded from MI1 - M6, with a MI2 a little weak.When it comes to MI7, there was a sudden change in editing style. Suddenly, there is a lot of conversations, a lot of posturing, a lot of talk about doomsday, a lot of explanations; sometimes, the explanations and points were repeated. In short, the editing was a little sloppy and there were a few scenes where we looked at each other and asked when was this going to over.MI8 (the Final Reckoning) increased the weakness of the editing in M7 by two to threefold. After the first 25 minutes, we turned to each other and asked when is the real story going to start. It's OK to draw from previous movies to connect the whole storyline, but the time spent and the footages were too excessive. Again, points were repeated and after a while it began to feel like the movie was long-winded and draggy. I was beginning to yawn when the clock hit the 30 minute mark and was feeling very let down by an action movie that began its first 25 minutes like a soap opera. Too much talking and screenplay was poorly constructed. I am not the slightest bit inspired by the conversations. The screenplay attempts to sound intelligent but they do not. In short, the new editing style, which started in MI7, is under par even to mediocre movie editing. Motorcycle chasing and car chasing scenes were too long and repetitive.If Tom Cruise wants to wrap up this franchise, this last movie is leaving a bad taste in the mouth.I feel a little cheated for paying full price to watch this movie in the theater. I should have waited and get the Blu-ray. I thought they would have received enough feedbacks from the MI7 to avoid the same mistakes but not only did they not correct it, they deepened the mistakes. The franchise is going down hill."

The whole franchise is an achievement that may never be topped. The whole experience was so shockingly good I felt that I was literally flying. Is it really The FINAL Reckoning? Probably not, but I really hope it gets the love it deserves, I know that people love fallout, but for me the franchise just kept getting better with each movie.

Tom Cruise may be committed, but even he can't carry a story that feels recycled and uninspired.The villain was forgettable, the dialogue felt flat, and the emotional moments were forced.

          "content": "If Tom Cruise were to retire tomorrow, he could be proud of his legacy in this movie.I debated whether to see it in 4DX or IMAX, and I think what persuaded me was Tom Cruise's reputation for controlling all aspects of his movies. 4DX can be fun, well-done, or downright annoying. Badly-done 4DX detracts from a film. Yet a lot was riding on this movie. It's suggested that it might be the last in the M. I. series. There's only so much stuntwork that Cruise can execute and claim as he punches into his sixties. And a weak M. I. would really look like milking the can. So basically I chose 4DX on trust.Before the film started there was a message from Cruise thanking the audience for coming to see the film in the way it was intended to be seen - in the cinema. I was feeling slightly rattled by the profligate 4DX effects in preceding trailers. So you'll be happy to know that 4DX was used in the way it must have originally been intended - with a certain discretion so that it adds to the atmosphere of a movie rather than constant jumps and jolts drawing attention to themselves. I remember thinking in the underwater scenes, \"people would be missing something without 4DX\".There is more to it than that of course. The triumphant culmination of the series that has more \"wow\" factor than the rest of them. The emotional tension, the communication between the players, alignment with the current zeitgeist and concerns about AI, and the rush of knowing that Cruise is really jumping off planes and doing stunts for which many future filmmakers would just use CGI. If you watch the \"making of\" clips, yes, the safety rope and headcam have been digitally removed, but it's still Cruise up there on the wing of a propeller plane and then acting his heart out as he freefalls from a great height.What can equal the macho sexiness of great filmstars of old like Sean Connery when we live an age where such dynamics are no longer really acceptable? I think that it's maybe characters that care deeply about each other and in an unspoken way. We have remarkable male-female bonding with the amazing Hayley Attwell - and also the deep male camaradie between the Cruise and Simon Pegg characters. Bonds built on values. Where people go beyond what is just expected of themselves and each other.The cast and crew had a four-year mission to achieve things that would have been thought 'impossible'. To entertain us in new ways. And above, make us feel good. The final reckoning? Mission achieved."

          "content": "I absolutely loved Dead Reckoning (Part 1), but this is very padded and hurts the first film a little. It's also overlong.After being told that the Entity is unstoppable in Part 1, we now learn you can stop it by plugging a USB into a hard drive, and then pulling out a different USB drive really quickly. They tell us this on a loop for the first two hours, interspersed with shots of Nuclear Weapons of different nations all ready to launch, but presumably all built in the same factory as paint jobs aside, they could be interchangeable. I've no insider knowledge on this of course, but I suspect only the US and Russia would actually paint flags on their nukes, it seems a bit too gung-ho for other nations.Essentially the first two hours is people telling us that everything is really dangerous, but not much happening. No action. No set pieces. No plot motion. It's all still enjoyable enough as these actors and characters always look like they're having fun, but you could easily cut an hour of screen time and lose nothing.I spent the first twenty-five minutes waiting for something spectacular to happen so they could jump into the traditional theme tune and title sequence. Nothing came, so eventually they just gave up and ran the titles. Here comes the next foreshadowing of disappointment - the music is by two people I'd never heard of using internet handle monikers - and yes, it's nowhere near as good as previous films as a result. It could have been an AI prompt \"make some Mission:Impossible ish music please\".My real issue comes with all the re-writing and retconning. Remember Briggs from the last film? You thought that was some clever callback to Dan Briggs in the TV show? No, he's Jim Phelps' son. No reason given why, no explanation of who his mother was, but presumably not Phelps' wife Claire - I've checked and the actress who played her is only five years older than the actor playing Briggs/Phelps Jr... no mention of Phelps ever having had a kid with anyone else, but if it's convenient to the plot why not? Except, as I've said...it goes nowhere.This is just one of many attempts to unify the series and pretend they had a plan all along - it also includes pretending the Rabbit's Foot from M:I3 was actually a source code for this AI and not a biological MacGuffin after all. They even bring back the guy from Mission:Impossible 1 who was in charge of the data vault, William Donloe (Rolf Saxon), but I will say that guy earned his place in this film, and that he ended up being my favourite character, so that's one win for the filmmakers from me.Sorely absent is Vanessa Kirby. I'm guessing for no reason other than real life scheduling. There's a lack of characters generally. I'm still hurt they shafted Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) in the last film too; you'd think they'd at least alude to some sadness she's gone, but beyond a montage of people dying from every film so far (yup!), there's no mention at all. Nor is any reverence given when they needlessly kill off Luther, the only character besides Hunt to have appeared in every film. I'd expected after her name being in the titles of the last film that we'd see more from Mariela Garriga, but nope, we just get the same flashback here. At least she got paid, I guess.Finally after two hours of Meandering: Possible, we get to the action set pieces. First, Hunt swims to the bottom of the Ocean to scavenge from a submarine, which proves, along with the opening and handcuffed-together thrills of Part 1, that the writers have definitely seen Tomorrow Never Dies and there's still more to mine from it. Maybe Hunt will take on a tech/media baron in \"Mission: Impossible : We were just sh***ing you, here's another\".Finally we get an absolutely thrilling crawl over a biplane, the likes of which we haven't seen since people were dancing all over them in 1933's Flying Down to Rio. If you survive the first two hours, you're in for a treat at the end.All criticisms aside, bad Mission: Impossible is still good."

Even found myself noticing that I was literally holding my breath at certain points in the movie. My wife says, \"are you going to survive the mission\". Over the top action, thrilling, and of course, some of the action that Ethan pulls off, you think, \"could this even really be possible\". If you're a fan of the franchise, the only disappointment that comes is knowing the run is over. The run time may seem a little long, but trust me, it doesn't seem that long at all while you're engrossed in the movie!"

I don't know if this is the best movie of the all movie in this series but it's easily in the higher ground then compared to most of them. The music by Max Aruj and some previous composed pieces by Lorne Balfe especially made this movie feel more epic and added lot more gravity to the situations or scenes then it already had. Each and Every cast member really gave their everything but original trio of Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames really were the one who me emotional, Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff really setted a great example for the combination of beauty with brain and both of them are superbly gorgeous and very good looking, sidenote not necessary(it is kind of an nitpick but Ethan and Grace all of the sudden caring for each other so much like they were some kind of true lovers in an alternate universe was a bit odd but still I would also protect someone as beautiful Grace as Ethan did)The last 10 minutes really gave an great epiloguey end to this wonderful action franchise a franchise which perfectly balanced both of the heavy weight of action sequences with great emotional core and with it's twist and turns, I just hope in the future the don't undo all of this ...\nGoodbye, Ethan..."

I thought they jumped the shark with the whole submarine scene including immediately surfacing from 1,000 feet in the Arctic ocean without oxygen or a wetsuit; but they completely left the planet with the airplane scene. Those were the two biggest of the completely insane scenes in the movie. I understand that the movie is called \"Mission Impossible\", but this one should be called \"Mission Physically Impossible\". I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you are a huge Mission Impossible fan because the movie does tie up a lot of lose ends."

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is the sombre, epic and emotional finale this franchise deserves. The stakes have never been higher and the action reaches new heights for breathtaking practical spectacle. The film only slightly stumbles in the first act where the noble attempt to do its own homework for the audience hinders the rhythm but other than that it's Mission firing on all cylinders as the last movie star risks his life whilst going to the ends of the Earth to save the world from the timely threat of A. I.Tom Cruise's unwavering commitment to these films remains awe inspiring as his stunts have only increased the level of insanity and he gives one of his best performances as Ethan Hunt outside of those moments thanks to the sense of finality that comes with this particular instalment. Esai Morales dials up the camp for his returning villain role which ensures he's more memorable than some of the previous antagonists even if he still can't reach the level of Sean Harris or Philip Seymour Hoffman.All the returning members of Ethan's team give great performances despite the fact that they're all generally given less to do than usual. Pom Klementieff proves it was a wise choice to keep her character alive and the unexpectedly substantial return of Rolf Saxon actually works really well. Even though it has an almost overwhelming amount of characters overall, there's still time for some new additions to leave a lasting impression, especially Tramell Tillman as a very charismatic submarine captain.Director Christopher McQuarrie spends the estimated $400 million budget wisely by delivering two of the best action sequences ever put on screen. There's also plenty of scenes that are told without dialogue in a satisfying fashion which gives the score by Max Aruj and Alex Godfrey lots of time to shine. Eddie Hamilton's editing is vital to keeping the pacing strong in the exposition heavy opening hour where the crosscutting becomes a huge help to prevent it from slowing down too much."

The rest was just dull and very boring.Having said that much ado was made about getting the bends from coming up after a deep dive to the sunken submarine. A plan was hatched to use some high tech process to suppress consequences of the bends. That was not part of the plan. So what happened instead? Spoiler alert: our hero drowns but doesn't seem to suffer any effects of the bends. Huge plot hole! There is mention at some point of a portable decompression chamber. That's not believable. It only takes a moment's thought to consider the enormous pressures involved to conclude such a think would not be possible.Sleight of hand is confused with reaction time with the premise that the difference between an amateur pick pocket and a professional is all in the timing. At one point in the movie, in order to save humanity, there needs to be a reaction time of less than 1/10 second, so that role is given to the expert in sleight of hand. Totally unbelievable. No matter how good you are at sleight of hand, your reaction time depends on the speed of signals in your nerves."

Following up from Dead Reckoning, Ethan is continuing his battle with the Entity before the Entity takes over the world. I should first preface that I liked Dead Reckoning but found Ai being the main villain being a bad choice. With Final Reckoning, my opinion still stands. For almost a three hour movie, this movie is pretty bloated and self-indulgent. The first half of the movie is bloated with so much expositions and cuts. The first issue with the movie is that it tries to wrap everything together even when it doesn't make sense. Needless characters being connected to other characters suddenly and completely changing story elements from other movies. They also think the audience has no memory so it will flash back every character or story element multiple times from other movies or from this movie. They also have too many characters that half of them add nothing and are just there for set dressing. It is very obvious that story was an afterthought of the movie. The action set pieces are the bread and butter of the series and they are done well here. Unfortunately they are only in the second half of the movie and there are only two but they are exhilarating when they happen. They also do a good job of raising the stakes (mind you in a very ridiculous way) by the end and I was on the edge of my seat. I think if this movie was cut down more and made more of its own thing, this movie would be way more entertaining. As is it is ok and if you are a fan of the series, you may enjoy this. Hopefully this is that last of the series."

Part of it felt like studio meddling: we don't want to sell it as part 2, therefore we have to address audiences who haven't seen part 1 and therefore we have to recapitulate the whole first movie. Part of it was legacy building, which shows that Cruise & Co. Doesn't understand their franchise, because all these flashbacks prevented scenes which actually made the MI franchise great: suspense-packed action. And part of it is that modern cinema doesn't trust the perception of its audience and has to spell out every detail.You'd expect that all this exposition at least explains what's going on, but no! The motivation of the AI keeps being nebulous, the victory condition of our guys is strange and I don't buy the inevitability of nuclear war when the humans still have physical control over the bombs.The second half gets better, the underwater scenes look stunning, the stunts are great (but sometimes too unbelievable), Hayley Atwell is gorgeous as ever and has some nice moments, great to see Tramell Tillman too.

          "content": "\"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece, delivering an electrifying, emotional, and visually stunning conclusion to one of Hollywood's most iconic action franchises. Directed with masterful precision by Christopher McQuarrie and led by the indomitable Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, this eighth installment is a thrilling love letter to the series' 30-year legacy, blending jaw-dropping stunts, intricate storytelling, and heartfelt character moments into a near-perfect blockbuster experience.From the opening montage, which elegantly weaves together nostalgic callbacks to all seven previous films, The Final Reckoning sets a tone of reverence and ambition. The film picks up where Dead Reckoning Part One left off, with Ethan and his IMF team-Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Grace (Hayley Atwell)-racing against time to defeat the Entity, a rogue AI threatening global catastrophe. The stakes feel colossal yet personal, as McQuarrie and co-writer Erik Jendresen craft a narrative that balances apocalyptic tension with the intimate bonds of loyalty and sacrifice that have always defined Ethan Hunt.What sets this film apart is its unrelenting commitment to spectacle. The action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, with two set pieces standing among the franchise's all-time best. The underwater sequence inside a sunken Russian submarine is a nerve-shredding masterclass in suspense, using innovative cinematography and practical effects to create a claustrophobic, heart-stopping experience. Meanwhile, the climactic biplane sequence-a dizzying display of aerial acrobatics with Cruise himself dangling from the wings-pushes the boundaries of what's possible in action cinema. These moments, filmed with IMAX-certified cameras, demand to be seen on the biggest screen possible, delivering the kind of visceral thrill that reminds us why we love movies.Cruise, at 63, delivers a career-defining performance, infusing Ethan with a potent mix of grit, vulnerability, and relentless determination. His physicality remains unmatched, but it's his emotional depth-particularly in scenes with Atwell's luminous Grace and Rhames' steadfast Luther-that elevates this film beyond mere action. The ensemble shines, with Simon Pegg bringing both humor and gravitas as Benji steps into a leadership role, and newcomers like Tramell Tillman's suave Captain Bledsoe adding fresh energy. Even the return of minor characters, like Rolf Saxon's William Donloe, feels organic and rewarding, tying the franchise together with clever, heartfelt nods.The film's technical achievements are equally impeccable. Fraser Taggart's cinematography captures both the grandeur of global locations and the intimacy of character-driven moments. The score by Max Aruj and Alfie Godfrey pulses with urgency, enhancing the film's relentless pace without overpowering its quieter beats. While the nearly three-hour runtime might feel daunting, the film's methodical pacing ensures every moment serves the story, building to a finale that's both emotionally resonant and explosively satisfying.Critics might point to the dense exposition or somber tone as departures from the series' breezier entries, but these choices feel deliberate, grounding the fantastical stakes in a world that feels unnervingly real. The Entity's threat-an AI capable of manipulating truth and inciting global chaos-resonates as a timely cautionary tale, yet the film never sacrifices its escapist spirit. It's a delicate balance, and The Final Reckoning nails it, offering a finale that feels both conclusive and open-ended, leaving room for hope that Ethan Hunt's missions might continue.In an era where blockbusters often feel formulaic, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning stands as a testament to Tom Cruise's unwavering dedication to the theatrical experience. It's a film that doesn't just entertain-it inspires awe, reminding us of cinema's power to thrill, move, and unite. This is not just the best Mission: Impossible film to date; it's one of the greatest action films ever made. Run, don't walk, to the nearest IMAX theater and witness this exhilarating, unforgettable ride."

Women command everything and are infinitely noble. Even the suporting characters, Pegg, the Luther, never seen any real connection between them and Tom Cruise.Also there is one \"fight\" scene where we just see a bloody aftermath that is si stupid I thought I was watching a parody.Yes the action is great. Tom Cruise brings the stunts, brings the running, and for his age is still in fantastic physical shape. I still admire him but I worry Top Gun was a last hurrah for Cruise.

But there is also a pang of sadness - this being the last ride of Ethan Hunt. Yeah, that cuts deep.Now for the film: it completely follows the traditional MI theme + action-hero formula. You will get all that you anticipate - suspense, drama, awe-inspiring stunts, and speedy narration. But don't even dare to glance away - miss a line of dialogue and bang you are lost in the scene!The film carries forward the MI story perfectly without feeling repetitive or boring. The performances are solid all around. And yes, there's a certain death in the movie that really caught me off guard. Not naming names, but that twist definitely adds emotional weight.Overall, I'd rate the movie 8/10 - solid, thrilling, and satisfying.But for Tom Cruise alone, for the legacy, the stunts, and the passion... 10/10.Mission: Accomplished. ✅"

The villain, Gabriel, and the AI antagonist don't quite match the tension of previous adversaries, making the conflict feel less engaging."

          "content": "🏆95%For the most part, I've heard positive things about the movie, but I did hear a couple of critics say that it's a little disappointing, and after watching the movie, I completely disagree. Sure, the movie does focus more on the plot than the action, but when we get those action scenes, they are some of the most incredible and intense scenes I've ever seen. This movie has easily the best stunts of the franchise. The plane scene will make your palms sweat, and the underwater scene might be the best scene of the whole entire franchise. The only issue I have with the movie is the lack of The Entity. In the previous movie, The Entity did a decent amount of things, but in this one, The Entity did pretty much nothing, and The Entity is supposed to be the main antagonist. Anyway, besides that, I don't really have any other major complaints for the movie. I heard a couple of critics say that the story was difficult to follow, but I didn't have an issue with following the story myself, but I guess I do see why some people might. There's a lot going on in this movie, so if you were not paying attention hard enough, then I could see why some might have a difficult time understanding what's going on. Anyway, another thing I want to talk about is the stakes of the movie. This movie has easily the biggest stakes of the whole entire franchise, and you'll instantly notice that at the beginning of the movie. Another thing I want to mention is how this movie ties in to some of the previous films. Some characters from the previous movies appear in this, but to be honest, putting these characters in the movie wasn't really necessary. The only reason they're in this is to get the major fans of the franchise excited in the theater once they see them appear. Even though it wasn't necessary, I did enjoy seeing them again. Now, there's one more thing I want to talk about, and that is, where would I rank this among all the Mission: Impossible movies? Right now, I'm kind of unsure where I would place it. I think I'll have to give this movie a rewatch before I'm certain where I should place it. For now, it's somewhere between the top 2-3 best in the franchise for me. My top 2 before seeing this were Fallout and Dead Reckoning. I do think Fallout is better than this movie, but I'm unsure if I like this or Dead Reckoning more. If I were forced to choose one of the two right now, I might choose this over Dead Reckoning, but until I give this movie a rewatch, both this and Dead Reckoning are very interchangeable for me. Anyway, that's it for my extremely long review. I think this might be the longest review I've ever written for a movie. Overall, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is an amazing end to what's arguably the greatest action franchise of all time!"

          "content": "It's an action thriller set in 2026 worldwide and is the eighth in the Mission: Impossible series. It's also a continuation of \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part One,\" with the same primary human villain and artificial intelligence adversary, Entity. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), now looking his age (63), returns at the request of President Sloane (Angela Bassett) to once again save the world from a cataclysm. Gabriel (Esai Morales) is the human villain now trying to control Entity for his own purposes. Ethan's team includes skilled thief Grace (Hayley Atwell), computer genius Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), field operative Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and Gabriel's former ally, Paris (Pom Klementieff).The first part of the film spends a lot of time rehashing Ethan Hunt's past and uses a lot of quick cuts to mask a reduced amount of Ethan's derring-do. Of course, some on the United States side remain in pursuit of Ethan, while others support his unorthodox approach to problem-solving. The last half hour contains a well-done biplane chase confrontation between Ethan and Gabriel, which saved my rating from being a five. The final ten minutes contain unnecessary character regurgitation and a lengthy tribute to Ethan by Luther. The ending also wimps out on any sense of realism. James Bond had a better final reckoning."

And Final Reckoning is no different.This was an absolutely fun and super entertaining movie. It has a long running time (2hr.50min.) but never felt dragged because of the nerve-wracking, intense premise.Yes, there are very few light-hearted comical scenes, and this is a continuing storyline from the previous installment (Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning). However, this movie is not just a spy action movie, but an action drama in essence. Also, this movie actually connects the entire previous Mission Impossible movies story.The underwater sequence which is a nail-biting edge of the seat scene, and the last 40 min. Climax sequence are really breath-taking. What a phenomenal action scenes!These scenes looks astonishing in IMAX screen because these are the done in IMAX compatible camera (Sony CineAlta Venice camera) in the IMAX aspect ratio (1.90:1).Tom Cruise is an absolute legend when it comes to his conviction for movies. His agility and guts to pull off those bloody brilliant practical action stunts at the age of 62 are insane.In this day and age where almost everything is done using VFX and CGI with body double, Tom Cruise performs mind-boggling action sequences in real locations and with practical stunts by himself, simply to make the big-screen cinematic experience truly worthy for viewers.He truly is the last action star in the world.This is the final Mission Impossible movie in the whole franchises.For sure Agent Ethan Hunt will be missed.Mission Impossible movies remind me why theatres are worthy going.I would rate it 8/10. A really worthy cinematic experience.In my opinion MI:Fallout still holds the 10/10 in the whole franchise."

My goodness, this was incredibly slow and far too long. There's a 15 minute underwater scene with no dialogue that had me rolling my eyes so much. And when it kept going and going and going, that's when I was truly ready to walk out of the movie. Yes, this wrapped up the series fine enough, but it was easily the most boring in the franchise."

It's as though Tom and company got tired of thinking about what made people like the M:I movies--not that they were ever perfect; there has always been something of the \"look at how cool we are\" element even in the best entries like Mission: Impossible III. But these last two feel far more like paint-by-numbers: Pick an element of an action movie, throw a little twist in, and plug it in to the story. Repeat a few times to fill out a nearly three-hour movie instead of focusing on substance for two hours 15 minutes, and the audience will buy it. For extra points, you can even have the villain laughing maniacally at the hero's attempts to defeat him late in the movie even though he has shown no inclination to do so for the entirety of the two movies until now! Oh, but be sure, to wrap it up, that you have the other remaining \"team\" members--even if they weren't such before--each appear as if at random to look at the hero from a distance and then go on their way rather than coming to ask how he's doing or question what happened... because that looks so much cooler than anything people might actually do in a situation like that."

Almost all the recent films have been spot-on for me - fast-paced action, crazy stunts, gripping storylines. But this time, it felt different somehow.The beginning drags on endlessly. The first hour is almost all flashbacks and exposition, even though the movie is technically the second part of Dead Reckoning. Instead of jumping straight back into the action, it feels like they're retelling half of the first movie. It came across more like a highlight reel than a new film.Then comes the first \"action scene\"... and you don't even see it. No joke - you just hear noises and watch someone observing. In a Mission: Impossible film, I don't want to see reactions; I want to see Ethan Hunt crashing through windows.Even the villain Gabriel was incredibly bland this time. Little presence, no depth, no clever rivalry - and his ending was almost slapstick. I sat there thinking, \"Is that really it?\" The scene was more laughable than thrilling.But: the second half gets way better. Once it moves toward the submarine part, the film finally picks up. There are some really strong scenes, cool locations, and the classic MI tension. The big plane stunt was impressively done too. And Tom Cruise? Still an absolute machine.All in all: Not a bad movie. But for a Mission: Impossible installment, it started too slow, had too little excitement in the first half, and a pretty disappointing villain. Fans can definitely watch it - but I'd lower your expectations a bit beforehand."

A plethora of characters all given their moment to shine but none stood out in any way worthy of mention.The action had an over 2 hour lead up and it was as good as they say but at this point in the movie it almost felt out of place,what felt like a drama now became an action movie and then back to drama.It's a good movie and worthy of the ticket price,the sound design alone and the stunt sequence justifies that but as a stand alone movie it's a 6.5 for me and anything above that I just can't fathom.

I was never not engaged, and my expectations were low for the first hour and a half, but I very much enjoyed it; it wasn't as much recap as I was led to believe. And those last thirty minutes are as good as movies can get. Aside from the biplane sequence becoming my new favorite stunt in the whole franchise, the ending's emotion and relevant messaging was the perfect end to this mounting franchise (if it is the end). It had me tearing up, and I'm so glad this franchise we have all grown to love stuck the landing with perfect style and emotion. I love this movie and I love this franchise, and this is just the absolute perfect ending. And, the stakes have never been higher, and you really hold your breath.

Plus, the question is - the IMF (US government) had possession of The Rabbit's Foot so how did Russia get it (Dead Reckoning)? What I anticipated most was Paris, joining Ethan's team but she only had one chance to exact revenge on Gabriel but her rifle jammed. To me, Ethan should have focused on the fact that Gabriel killed Ethan's girlfriend (only revealed in Dead Reckoning) and Ethan was charged with her murder - leading to him joining the IMF. Ethan's struggles in this movie ALL stem from him not taking out Gabriel. Maximum conflict but not believable. Gabriel's demise (came way too late) looked like a theatrical afterthought. How Ethan and his team took care of The Entity was clever but it wasn't enough to increase my rating or save this movie."

Personally I think The Final Reckoning is one of the weaker ones. Not action-wise or entertainment value, which is just as good as any of the others, but comes to writing and story which has a lot of holes in them. I didn't like the last one much which felt like action with little substance, and I have the same feeling here. These movies lack a soul, lack that undefined oumpfh which make action movies not just action-y but also a good movie experience.Watching this movie feels like eating at McDonalds - you know what you are getting and it is temporarily filling but you know it is not very good food and you wish you had a proper meal instead.The main issue I have is the \"villain/s\" and their behaviour and contra this with Ethan and his team who seem to be the saviour of humanity for some reason. None of it makes much sense. The editing is another thing that bothered me. The movie feels a bit choppy, never letting the scenes breath properly and the editing seem to be to get us to action scenes rather than to build the story.With all of that said this is still not bad. In an era of increasingly bad movies, Mission Impossible is, a bit sadly, one of the better ones. I had a decent time, but I will also completely forget all about this movie after posting this.I give it a 6/10 and I tentatively recommend. You can definitely do worse and if you liked the previous movies, especially the one preceding this one, you are likely to enjoy this. If you are looking for substance, great editing and a good story then you are not the intended audience."

Easter egg collectors should be happy with the callbacks, several of those loose or ambiguous ends finally having some clarity to help get us to the end of this worldwide crisis. It's a very integrated movie with a nice, realistic presentation mixed with theatrical flair to keep it engaging. It's got military jargon with purpose, used well to establish the stakes, add some complications, and provide a side story that tests the merits of Ethan's relationship with the organization. All the while, we are getting mission elements that feel very approachable, a realistic design that feels approachable, and mixed with the political tension that such an ordeal brings with it. I liked that realistic feeling, keeping things mostly in check, but that they weren't bound by the rules of physics too much to bend away from the action scenes. The eighth installment gives you some of the more intense survival moments compared to other films, some close calls, intense circumstances, and a time limit that helps to up the stakes and give you those tense moments. Fantastic sound editing and special effects help to bring the world to life, the computer sheen present, but buffed enough to not ruin the illusion of the moment, with impressive editing to bring the real stunts and CGI together. Further helping to elevate the scenes is a brilliant orchestral work, blaring instruments adding extra weight that coordinates with the scene, further awakening the excitement of the scene for a reviewer like me. It's intense, grandiose, but still contained to the point of not drowning out the other elements of the film.As for the rest of the likes, Mission: Impossible still finds a way to be funny at times in the face of the imminent disaster the bad guys are bringing. Final Reckoning continues to find ample opportunity to put jokes in, sliding jabs, clumsiness, and just the right amount of awkwardness and sarcasm to have me laughing out loud in the theater. The story continues to find those emotional ties, crafting characters to root for, while using those stakes to press whether your character will survive or die in the shadows. Such aspects keep the series more engaging, especially as death seems permanent in this series, unlike other franchises. Having that investment is important to a reviewer like me, and though it's not perfect, I still enjoy seeing our heroes have to contend with mortality than most characters. Finally, the acting is still just as consistent as ever, with each team reprising their roles and delivering the solid performances you expect in this franchise. Cruise is still intense, wild, but holds that slight emotional vulnerability that Ethan has for his friends. Atwell's balance of snarky sass and unbridled trust evolves a bit in this film and adds a bit more of that team element that the last movie was just showing. Rhames is still killing it as Luther, his wisdom and tranquility always added to help bridge those personalities and plans to have an inkling of a chance to work. The chemistry is the best part for me in this series, and at times, Final Reckoning still gets this element right. When all of this comes together, I found that this film's nearly three-hour runtime melt away (at least after the first hour and before the last twentyish minutes).DISLIKES:\nBoring Forty-Five Minutes\nVery Complicated\nGets Very Over The Top At Times\nVillains Need Better Use\nCharacter Balance Is Weaker\nMore Action\nAlmost Needed To Be Two Movies\nToo Much Plot Armor?Summary:\nAs hinted above, the first part of the film isn't awful, it's just kind of bloated with exposition that felt a tad too long. Some of this is trying to connect things from the past, those quick transitions from Part 1 hastily pulled together in these montage aspects that feel quick, underwhelming, and a rush to get to more speeches. Then, we have to go out of our way to establish these potential relationships, which in the grand scheme didn't amount to much outside of an emotional maturity they were going for. The bloat is fairly contained after that, but Final Reckoning's plot gets a tad more complicated than previous films, the political subplots competing for dominance with the main film and making a rather complex web of relationships. This does help make the realism consistent, but at the cost of some of the other simpler elements fans of the series come to see, like those over-the-top stunts Cruise likes to dream up. Some of these stunts are a tad too over the top for me, the coincidental factors a tad too convenient, so that it starts to get to ludicrous levels that only a popcorn muncher can bring. These moments are still tense, but start to get a tad long-winded in that cheesy element that I felt there could have been better direction and time management. Maybe it's because the main villain was absent and had less bite than the first saga, his grand scheme a bit conventional and unimpressive in regards to the Mission: Impossible franchise. Keeping those more sinister members in check and adding some strategy that wasn't so low-key could have helped break open the political components a little more, or at least added the typical vibe this series thrives on. Not just the villains, but the other characters could have used some better integration and were not nearly as needed as they were in missions past. Several of them almost seemed pointless until the very end, as Ethan was performing the impossible, and the rest just kind of walked around and got lucky. Not my favorite \"team-based\" tactics in a movie, but the crew has enough involvement to still be entertaining. Another component I was disappointed in was the lack of heart-pumping action that I got in the previous installments. Final Reckoning is devoid of any serious gunplay, with only a few tidbits of hand-to-hand combat to help break up the moments. Maybe it was because they ran out of time, or perhaps editing required it to cut a lot off, but something just felt off about the excitement in this film. It could also be the plot armor that greatly developed early on, granting Ethan far more room to wiggle than previous installments. I guess what I can state is, Final Reckoning feels like it might have needed another intermission, and that this saga should have been a self-contained trilogy to optimize everything Cruise envisioned.The VERDICT:\nMission: Impossible- Final Reckoning is a big blockbuster that still capitalizes on the things that make big films fun for reviewers like me. It's bold maneuvers open up a world of crazy complexity and stunts to get caught up in, as we try to halt the dangers thrust upon us again. With a fantastic use of special effects, a cast of characters to engage with on some personal levels, and a story loaded with suspenseful moments in a semi-realistic feeling world, it really is a great way to open up the holiday weekend. A decent pace for the most part, the three-hour run time has enough entertaining qualities to cut through the time, and caters to a wide variety of people. However, I agree with other reviewers that this mission feels a bit incomplete and lackluster to the previous installments. Putting the bloated exposition aside, the movie seemed to struggle with trying to tie up so much in one movie. A rather bland villain didn't help to spice things up, and the movie's focus on political frustrations and negotiations, I felt, took up too much time that which complicated things and took the space of the more conventional franchise tactics. Some of the plans' coincidences are a tad too far-fetched, and I don't think the team's skills were as needed, given that Ethan was doing much more of the work than before. Does it work for a story element? Yes, I can see how it works, but it sort of cuts up the necessity of including them to begin with. In addition, the action feels like it's not all there, sort of calmed down and turned to more extreme stunts than the usual gunplay and close-quarters combat I liked in other installments. Is it worthy of the theater? Yes, I think it is for much of the spectacle and enjoyment it brought me, and I believe it will bring to a wide audience group. Factoring all this in, this film gets:\nSpy/Action/Adventure/Thriller: 7.5-8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0."

          "content": "I wasn't over enthusiastic about the first part so my sights were set pretty low going into this. Wonder why they opted to call the first film Dead Reckoning part one if they went with The Final Reckoning for the second? But, I digress.This was more a homage to the franchise than the previous film. The beginning consisted to a large degree of a montage of flashbacks from earlier films. Wasn't really thrilled about that.When things got going it was largely what you've come to expect from this franchise in the latter years. The plot has not been the driving force of these movies, but the action and the stunts. This maybe true more so here than in any of the other films. The AI adversary was of course woefully present here and felt as minute as in the first installment. Felt like they dummed down the AI to fit the narrative. The scenes from the control room lacked urgency for me. The acting was ok, but even if they were at defcon 1 and the world was on the brink of nuclear annihilation it didn't feel compelling.The absolute redeeming factor here were the two set pieces; the underwater sequence and the aerial shot. Both were very well made and felt engaging, although perhaps not as good as the train sequence in Dead Reckoning. Cruise again shows that his devotion to fitness still pays off.I'm a bit of a sucker for the first film so I was glad to see they brought back Donloe in plausible manner. Him and his wife were a bright spot. Tillman was a treat in a rather limited role as the submarine commander. The should have landed him earlier. Atwell was a bit better than in the first film, but the turnover of members in the group has made it hard to care for all of them. Only good ol' Luther was left from the start.The ending was moot since for me it was no ending. Of course everyone is open to interpret the meaning as they wish, but I had expected a proper sendoff here. Even to see Hunt die in the end would have been better than what we got. Now they just left an opening for yet another film. You would think that at some point even Cruises body says no to that."

When this film came out in the UK on 21 May I went to the cinema to watch it. I was not disappointed. Then again I've thoroughly enjoyed all of them. The o lot one I did not like was the second one. I felt it lost a lot of the formulae that made the first one so great.I would not say this is the best one but version in my opinion. However, each of them offers something different. I love the action, the story, the performances and the stunts. Even the humour so they have a bit of everything and Cruise definitely knows how to choose some of the best cast members. I can fault any of them.It's incredible how much Cruise can pull off. He's certainly still very fit and he's not as young as he used to be to be. That aeroplane stunt too ten years of planning is what he said. He found it hard to breathe at the speed. The underwater scenes also spectacular. He knows how to make films and he always says he's always loved films and that's obvious.I look forward to another. Some say this is the last one but that's not for certain and I feel cruise is not done yet. He still has ideas up his sleeve and I don't think he's ready to stop now.I recommend this film. It's got a bit of everything. I did find the underwater stuff a tad unrealistic but that entertainment. You've got to have stuff that's unbelievable in films to enjoy them and witch off to reality.Tom Cruise is one of the best actors out there in my opinion. In the unlikely event you are reading this review, please make another and make that the best one."

The air scene with Tom's acrobatics are amazing. And watching him run is beautiful and inspirational - I could watch him run for hours. All actors in the movie deliver us what we want to see and Cruise once again proves he's not just acting the part - he is the part.I'm the type to re-watch movies over and over again and this one is truly in the top 10 of my re-watch choices.Enjoy!"

Instead, it limps to the finish line with a bloated runtime, tangled plotlines, and a steady stream of characters explaining the plot to each other (and to us) as if we're stuck in a live audiobook of a spy thriller that forgot to thrill.Yes, there are flashes of brilliance, a few solid fight scenes and one nicely handled touch that nearly redeems it. But they're buried under so many layers of exposition and mid-tier subplots that the film collapses under its own weight. It's less a high-octane finale and more a confused boardroom drama with occasional punches.There's a callback to Mission: Impossible III that no one buys for a second, I rewatched it straight after just to be sure. Nice try. But no.Gone is the sharp, sexy, fast-paced energy of the original. That film had wit, charm, and a cheeky sense of fun. This one feels like a committee project dragged out in reshoots and tied together with chewing gum and despair.If this is the reckoning, maybe it's time to rewind. Watch the first film again, it holds up. And when the inevitable prequel rears its head, let's pray Hollywood doesn't fumble it with more over-stuffing and soulless sheen.As for the future: it'll flop, AI will be blamed, and somewhere a screenwriter will wonder if maybe they should've written something worth remembering instead of \"Tom Cruising\" along on fumes."

          "content": "Dead Reckoning - Final Part marks a surprising low point for the Mission: Impossible franchise - not due to a lack of spectacle, but rather because of a screenplay that has lost all sense of rhythm, tone, and narrative coherence.Two sequences stand out and are worth the price of admission: the thrilling airplane scene, executed with remarkable tension and kinetic flair, and a breathtaking underwater sequence set inside a submarine, where Tom Cruise once again proves himself a master of physical storytelling. These are moments of true cinematic impact - meticulously choreographed, tightly edited, and visually compelling.Unfortunately, the rest of the film falters badly. The first hour is weighed down by clunky exposition and dialogue that borders on the unintentionally absurd. The performances feel constrained, as if the actors are reading from a first draft rather than embodying their characters. The pacing drags, and instead of building tension, the narrative meanders through empty exchanges and implausible plot turns.It's genuinely baffling that Tom Cruise - a usually discerning producer and consummate performer - would endorse a script so dramatically undercooked. What should be a high-stakes, gripping spy thriller often feels like a parody of the genre it helped define.In the end, this installment offers two standout action set pieces surrounded by an ocean of missed opportunities. Mission: Impossible was once synonymous with smart, pulse-pounding entertainment. Here, the pulse is faint - and the intelligence, largely absent.Watch it for the two masterful scenes. Skip the rest."

Where the formula was always the same and even when you knew what they were going to do, you didn't care because it was Mission Impossible! Instead of making a Mission Impossible movie, they made a melodramatic, sappy fair well. There was too many flash-back scenes, weird \"knowing\" looks and the music sounded like it should be in a soap opera. There should have been the exciting theme music throughout but alas there was not. It was definately not action packed like the previous movies. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it was the end of a 28 year run of great movies. If this was the first movie, it would have bombed."

There are some retcons and callbacks, one involving a character from the first movie (played by Rolf Saxon) that works really well, and others that feel a little more forced.The opening of this film almost feels like the recap of a modern TV show, a PREVIOUSLY ON essentially. The story gets very convoluted very quickly and, indeed, the production of both Reckoning films wasn't exactly smooth. Both COVID and several strikes interrupted the productions of both films, and you can tell that turmoil had an effect on the finished cut.But...There's still a lot to like! This is a good time in the theater. The two big set pieces in Final Reckoning are highlights of the entire series. One sequence that's underwater is reminiscent of the best scenes from James Cameron's 1989 epic The Abyss, while the other sequence that has been featured all over advertising and posters doesn't disappoint. It's some of the best stunt work you'll see.And this isn't really a spoiler, but I also kinda like that the REAL villain of the movie is stupid people. Or, gullible people to put it in a nicer way. The idea that an algorithm could cause so much chaos by predicting how people will react-and manipulating them to react certain ways-is eerily plausible in 2025, even if most of the actual plot is utterly ridiculous. We almost enter the territory of magic here with some of the technology, and Hunt himself is almost portrayed as a messianic figure.Speaking of which, in this film there are some major world altering events happening, but we don't ever really see the reaction on the streets except briefly in the opening. I think an action scene through a riot or clashing protesters could have been fascinating and felt very visceral, while also really showing the stakes of everything that is going on (and this one goes much further than previous MI films as far as the threat to the entire world).Anyway, if you like the series, this is worth catching in a theater! My rankings, so you can decide whether to take this review with a grain of salt...6\n5\n4\n1\n8\n7\n3\n2I actually think the third film has a great opening, great villain, and fantastic action set pieces, so for me this is a pretty consistent series. Fallout is still easily my favorite. I could see Final Reckoning going either up or down on the list with a rewatch. I saw it in IMAX, and the expanding scenes looked great."

I mean, like that film, it still suffered from the over bloated runtime, pacing issues & drawn out dialogue scenes but, ironically enough, this film had a better & more simplified story & to be honest, a more exciting plot that made you want to keep watching!The cast do a good job here including the main man who by the way, does it again! There's some eye candy with Hayley & Pom as well as some epic action & set pieces! The first act does take a while to get there, but isn't bad at all! The throwbacks & flashbacks to the original films was a nice touch & the main actor from the very first Mission: Impossible being involved here was pretty good!The runtime is overly long & the film does have some pacing issues! Ironically enough, for the most part, the film wasn't boring & by the time it crossed the 1 hour mark, it did pick up & get better! The film is 2 hours & 42 minutes long (202 minutes) which is long & to be honest, could be 20 minutes shorter! That being said the film was thrilling enough to ignore the dragged out nature of the film & the ending was pretty ace to be fair!Overall, it's a pretty epic conclusion to a franchise spanning over 30 years! The conclusion is pretty ace & the film does the job aside from the poor runtime & pacing! Give it a watch, it's better than the previous film, Dead Reckoning Part 1, that's for sure!8/10."

Also much of the first hour could've actually been left out of the movie without hurting the movie at all because most people don't need all the backstory to enjoy the mission impossible series. Like all movies with several sequels prequels the writers often put too much filling in the script. The movie easily could've been two hours without taking any important storyline out. The Russian submarine scene was too long and agonizing because of all the problems Ethan Hunt encountered in retrieving the device that was needed to stop the entity. The underlying political message was bothersome. I didn't care for the Arctic scenes that just made it ridiculously impossible for Ethan to achieve his mission to save the planet from a mass nuclear extinction event. Well, at least most of the team returned in the end unscathed,saving mankind."

It's chock-full of past events from just about every movie and is full of surprises. But I feel like at some point this is a bit overdone and tried way too hard to tie everything together (at a couple of \"reveals\" during the movie, I rolled my eyes). The scenes bring the intensity I expect with some heart-pounding missions and situations. The runtime is quite a bit long and could have been cut, but it didn't feel too dragged out to where it was unenjoyable. The characters from Fallout and Dead Reckoning were fantastic as always, but I felt like additions like McCallany and Offerman felt a bit weird and unnecessary (they did a decent job, though). This could have been an all-time classic, but it repeated the same mistakes of 2 by trying way too hard. 4/5 stars."

Save the planets in the Solar system ?On a more serious note MI8 is quite watchable, but as a \"grand\" finale it could have been better. The film has an overdose of Tom Cruise as he is almost in every scene; he is charismatic as ever and convincing (most of the time) but his team somehow gets a second grade treatment. The villain is really not up to standard: Don't get me wrong: Esai Morales is a fine actor but the lines he is given are simply ridiculous, he sounds more like a vindictive teen ager, with lines like \"Say I am the winner !\", and grinning and boasting about himself left right and center. One would expect the villain in a plot of this type with such high stakes to be much more sophisticated.The film could have been trimmed closer to 2 hours, and has generally a somber mood (night scenes, dark places..) except for the final scenes.The action scenes are impressive, but they somehow resemble video games: The hero is constantly encountering hurdles and obstacles, to be overcome, while the clock is ticking: The process becomes a bit tedious.To its credit the underwater sets and sequences are awesome, so is the clever linking of characters that appeared in previous episodes of MI, provided one has seen Ethan Hunt's previous outings.All in all MI8 is entertaining, but could have been better."

          "content": "This was by far the most disappointing of the the MI films. The plot was more flimsy than any previous MI films. The premise for why the world is on the brink of Armageddon was illogical. I couldn't follow how and why \"the entity\" - the self aware AI program run amok - wanted to kill off humanity or why all the world's nuclear powers were so afraid of each other - even close allies - that none would take their nuclear arsenals off line to prevent the entity from taking them over when they knew it would use them to kill of humanity. And the continued declaration that only one man - Ethan - can save the world bordered on parody. I laughed out loud many times at scenes that I'm not sure were supposed to be funny. And the whole movie was formulaic; almost nothing was unexpected, so there was no suspense. In prior MI films, there were plenty of unrealistic action scenes, but the reasons people did things at least made sense. In this film, creating contrivances for the action scenes was the only reason anyone did anything. I get that it was intended to be an homage to the whole MI series, but it still could've used a decent plot. I've loved the MI series but not this last flick. Kudos to 62 year old Cruise for still doing his own stunts, but they looked ridiculous. It's time to hand the role of Ethan to a new, younger actor. Cruise should just stick to producing these films going forward. Like the 007 franchise, there's no reason this one can't live on with a younger and more believable actor."

          "content": "Fun and genuine, Final Reckoning embraces the exaggeration and caricature of its origins with great dramatic charge and vulnerability from an already exhausted and dependent Ethan, who understands his weaknesses, but still conflicts with what seems to be a curse.How the dynamics of sacrifices and the lack of guilt on Ethan's side with the events in the worlds for his actions that previously seemed to be the most important are worked out, it is a great surprise when placed in dimension in the grand scope that is sometimes only summarized by acrobatics.Final Reckoning knows how to raise the threat to the maximum power and connect with its already great previous stories without having to reduce them.Fantastic editing work by Eddie Hamilton, how the scenes blend together and the harmony between flashbacks and real time is impressive with bold use of overlapping, dissolves and fades. As a non-expert in the area, it is difficult to put into words the magic of the work, but you can feel it throughout the film.Despite the excess of exposition, it makes sense for the magnitude of a story that tries to connect decades of cinema history and connect all the dots of a super villain that borders on cartoonish, but with a frightening background of reality and interesting points about the world.Inspiringly fun and impressive, Tom and his team offer us the best action and suspense scene of the decade and one of the best in the history of cinema. All I could think was \"keep going, don't stop here, don't cut, let's go to the limit\" totally immersed with him in the moment.A tense opening act rewards us with a hopeful conclusion of a message that seems, at the same time, about the characters in the film and about Tom as part of an endangered species in his area, something he doesn't want and the importance of people and art.Whether it's the parallel between his squad and his off-screen team or the parallel between Hunt and Cruise as fundamental in their two worlds, the exaggerated sentimentality doesn't become a nuisance but rather part of what will separate this film from all the others.Jill Taylor's costume design does its part here, capturing the essence of each character and the militaristic tone of the story without losing its vintage elegance and natural elements in her earthy tones and beautiful leather jackets."

Why does Tom Cruise run so weirdly? It's like he has sticks tied to his arms, needs the toilet urgently, and has mistaken a marathon for a sprint. His expression whilst doing it always seems odd - like he has immediately forgotten why he started running, and where he's running to. Honestly, it's bonkers. I almost feel that we need a silent film of Tom Cruise running as an infinite performance art piece in a modern art museum.So, what about the film? It's good fun, action packed, the cast are all in on the joke, so come across as plausible cliches. The stunts are great - although it would be nice in the Tomster gave some to other people. The story is decently convoluted, with the Direction and script keeping it going at a breathless pace.Suspend disbelief for this film. Indeed, take disbelief, gag it, chain it to a countdown timer on a nuclear device and put it in a cupboard, although it may still escape.This is an enjoyable conclusion (probably) to a highly entertaining series of films and well\nWorth the 37 hour run time of this episode. Take a drink and a sandwich with you. And, make sure your feet are on the floor, as you will spend a lot of time on the edge of your seat."

First off, the submarine was rolling and his gear caught on the submarine pulling him more off into a random location. How in the actual hell did she still manage to find him in time? Also how was she able to cut the hole to get him out and retrieve him? Lots of the ice is also covered with some snow. It's just something I really wanted too see done on screen.

          "content": "Today's film producers keep repeating: \"the writing in a film doesn't matter\". As an actor I listen to this, consider, and remain silent; it's not my place to criticize, you see. I get hired to do one job and nothing else! When an actor gives his opinion he becomes a bad actor, and usually proceeds to get fired on the spot... but between you and me? We can be honest: the script and plot form the \"narrative\" (which constitutes one of the eight vital elements of film). The writing is pivotal to the success of any production, despite many movies achieving greatness by other means, even occasionally thru only one exceptional aspect. \"Final Reckoning\" suffers from the decline of the film industry, most notably in its poor writing, causing it to desperately try to \"cruise\" to success solely off its action sequences.The \"Mission Impossible\" franchise has been a long running goldmine: almost all its titles have earned five times its budget at the box office. Its latest entry, however, \"Dead Reckoning\" (2023), wasn't able to break even. That film presented aspects of identity politics, a frustrating and incoherent plot, a cheapened rising action, and no resolution whatsoever. Its villain was otherworldly and difficult to relate to. \"Final Reckoning\" is meant to complete that film, and arrives two years too late (2025) to a very fatigued and indifferent moviegoer. We're now firmly in the collapse of the economy, in a divided society (among many lines), to a lying and manipulative media, and a world on the verge of nuclear war. \"Final Reckoning\" is meant to address some of these issues, but juggles too much at once. The resulting excessive plot devices lead to sudden exposition dumps which cut short the action and chill viewer excitement. This film's vast and overwhelming supporting cast prevents the audience from firmly relating to its characters, and the convoluted storylines prevent narrative events from carrying proper weight; these moments are rushed, despite the three hour runtime.\"Final Reckoning\" does indeed attempt to cruise its way to success thru action spectacle. Tom Cruise literally risks his life in order to deliver thrilling feats of performance, but will it sell? My prediction is it won't: the average American is now heavily saddled with mounting costs, social frustrations and divisive politics. \"Final Reckoning\" shoots itself in the foot with superficial extravagance, excessive explanations, and a strip down of its personalities. You can support Tom Cruise for his bravery by seeing this film in theatres. Otherwise, this movie lands squarely among its contemporaries as an over-budget, issue-ridden action flick, heavily reliant on its visual production, while never making its money back; very common issues in today's failing film industry."

This one also completely ripped off the plot from The Terminator, 41 years ago.They also aways have a scene where they have seconds to disengage a bomb. Man the amount of times I've seen this in movies, Hollywood really need to come up with newer ideas.How many times have we seen them try and stop a bomb within the very last seconds???

My favourite act of the movie would be the submarine act leading to what maybe the best shot in the entire franchise being when Ethan Hunt floats up towards the ice. I love how new characters were introduced while also tying up lose ends from previous movies by reintroducing old characters and plot lines. Tom cruise and Hayley atwells chemistry on screen is very strong at times. The stunts are always amazing but the plane sequence had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. My one con of the movie would be that during all press conferences they stated this is the last one. The last Mission Impossible, but in my mind the ending is very open for another sequel. Some may disagree but that's what I think. All in all I think 8/10 and Im going to have to give it a rewatch to solidify my opinions."

          "content": "When franchises now purport that they're making the last film in a series, it's usually just a question of whether the movie makes money or not. Despite much-touted and seemingly definitive farewells in X-Men, Harry Potter, or The Lord of the Rings, these properties keep being unearthed and milked until there's nary a cent left. The Mission: Impossible franchise has been surprisingly resilient-consistently delivering increasingly elaborate stunts for Tom Cruise to risk life and limb in. But now, the latest entry is marketed as the final outing for the character of Ethan Hunt.Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025) is a direct sequel to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning: Part 1(2023)-already one of the longest-titled films in blockbuster history-which now awkwardly retains its \"Part 1\" subtitle, while its sequel gets a fresh coat of paint. Once again, we're in a world where an all-powerful AI known as The Entity wants to bring about the end of mankind. Having obtained the key to stopping it in the previous film, rogue agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must now travel to the Arctic to locate a sunken Russian submarine containing the source code. The fate of the world (again) rests in his hands. He's joined by old friends like Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Grace (Hayley Atwell), along with former enemies Paris (Pom Klementieff) and Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis).The Final Reckoning is once again helmed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has now directed the last four installments of the franchise-and in doing so, helped craft some of its best. But with the pressure of creating a \"finale,\" McQuarrie stumbles into overcomplicated plotting and endless callbacks, losing the franchise's greatest asset: its sense of tightly executed, high-octane fun. Co-writing with Erik Jendresen (also a writer on Part 1), McQuarrie delivers a script that somehow manages to overexplain everything while also making less sense the more you think about it. The dialogue, plotting, and editing feel like they've been dumbed down to a shocking degree-treating viewers like they're watching the film with one eye on their phone and the other half-closed.As with Dead Reckoning: Part 1, The Final Reckoning doesn't just repeat itself-it hammers you with repetition until it becomes unbearable. Every plot beat is stated, then restated by another character, just to make sure we really, really get it. It's not just redundant-it's patronizing. The film seems genuinely afraid that the audience will forget what's happening if it doesn't spell it out again every five minutes. And the editing doesn't help. The film frequently cuts back to the same shot or moment from seconds earlier, repeating visual cues just in case you momentarily forgot what a submarine or USB key looks like. Final Reckoning feels like a movie edited by someone who assumes you're doomscrolling TikTok mid-scene.This constant handholding means the actual plot doesn't kick into gear until over an hour in. I checked my watch, and characters were still busy either recapping the previous film or rephrasing the very simple premise: \"go to the submarine, stop the AI.\" McQuarrie further complicates things by adding groan-worthy connections to previous films, and having characters make mind-numbingly illogical decisions-just so we can get to a manufactured \"tense\" moment. It's the kind of lazy plotting that feels more Fast & Furious than Mission: Impossible.That said, when The Final Reckoning finally leans into what this series does best-spy thrills and over-the-top action-it briefly remembers how to have fun. The submarine infiltration is a standout sequence, smartly constructed and genuinely suspenseful. It earns its place in the franchise's pantheon of impossible missions. The finale, involving two propeller planes, tries to raise the stakes-but the pacing drags and the climax never quite reaches the adrenaline-pumping heights of past finales. Instead of a crescendo, it feels more like a decent mid-tier set piece that overstays its welcome.Cruise still gives it his all, but the age is starting to show-despite the best efforts of makeup and lighting. The rest of the cast gets sidelined. Pegg and Atwell, who previously offered sharp comic and emotional beats, are reduced to glorified exposition machines. Meanwhile, the film clearly wants to land a big emotional punch between Ethan and Luther, but the writing doesn't quite deliver the weight it's aiming for.In the end, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a disappointment-following the already bloated Dead Reckoning: Part 1. It leans too heavily into endless exposition, condescending repetition, and frenetic editing that's allergic to letting any scene breathe. The lack of trust in the audience drags down the first half. Still, once Ethan finally gets moving, a strong submarine set piece and a decent airborne chase remind us of why we came. With a tighter script, smarter pacing, and just a little more faith in its viewers, The Final Reckoning could have delivered the thrilling supposed send-off this franchise deserved."

          "content": "Let's be honest-Mission: Impossible - Last Reckoning (yes, even the title is bloated) is a convoluted mess trying to disguise itself as high-octane cinema. The plot is so tangled in its own techno-thriller nonsense. The so-called \"story\" feels like a patchwork of action clichés, exposition dumps, and globe-trotting for the sake of cool backdrops.But the real problem? This movie is little more than a two-and-a-half-hour worship session for Tom Cruise. He's not just the lead-he's the messiah, the unflinching savior of the planet, the only man smart enough, fast enough, brave enough... you get the idea. Every other character exists purely to remind us how incredible Ethan Hunt is. There's no real teamwork, no genuine stakes, just Cruise sprinting, jumping, and glaring intensely while the world hangs in the balance again.What made the early Mission: Impossible films intriguing was the mix of espionage and ensemble dynamics. That's long gone. Now, it's just a bloated blockbuster with a messiah complex, disguising its lack of substance with slick stunts and endless dramatic stares.If you like your spy thrillers confusing, overstuffed, and centered entirely on one man's ego trip-this one's for you. The rest of us? We miss the \"impossible\" missions that actually made us care."

It showed how Ethan had grown up from being the man to being a team. It showed the loyal bond they built and the importance of trust. It reflected so much in two and some hours! The content to memorialize Luther and flashing back old team mates throughout the movie makes memorial weekend the perfect release time.The stunts and action were just freaking breathtaking.. as someone who didn't quite cared for the mission impossible series, I am thoroughly impressed!

And this film left me with the edge of my seat with every Tom Cruise insane stunts he has ever done, in every single Mission: Impossible franchise! And I can always hear the most perfect original theme song that's playing in my head right now.Tom Cruise performed so brilliantly as he usually does, and he he may be 60 years old, but he still got it. His incredible running skills and his stunts, and he never aged pretty differently, Simon Pegg did a really great job as always, and Hayley Atwell, was perfectly brilliant with her beautiful performance. Every casting crew in this film did a really brilliant job.And writer and director, Christopher McQuarrie, also did a fantastic job with his filmmaking directing skills for Mission: Impossible for decades, and the direction they were going with is the perfect conclusion that they have finally decided to end the most incredible franchise they have ever made for 29 years.I think this was a very good ending for Mission: Impossible franchise. A like Tom Cruise says: it may be the end of the franchise, but there's always a silver lining and always a new beginning to Mission: Impossible!10/10."

This series has been such a such a consistently enthralling experience my entire life.A perfect send off to Ethan hunt in the crew, though honestly I want more. See this on the biggest screen you can. If you have to binge watch the rest of the series to catch up first do it. This is what movies are All about. Over the top action sequences and strong performances (Angela basset kills it) cement this movie as one of the greatest action films ever made."

Why would they kill this franchise in the final film? Why not end it with a bang? This movie is agonizingly slow and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are maybe 2-3 action scenes in 3 HOURS! These 2-3 scenes last maybe 2-5mins each, except for the plane scene. The whole plot made no sense. We find out the sub sank in...2012!?!? What? And that the Entity is from the Rabbits Foot in MI3?!? Why? None of that made any sense. This type of AI is only something that has come about in recent years. AI is a terrifyingly real threat to the world now, but it wasn't in 2012, so that was unbelievable. Plus, the Entity is the villain, so where is it in the movie. We see it once at the beginning and that's it. If it was trying to control the world bombs would have went off, people would've died. WW3 would definitely have started, but NONE of that is the case. The Entity is just able to take over all the nuclear weapons and then do...nothing? Ummm, yeah right. Usually I feel stressed during MI movies, in a good way, because the stakes are high and the action is relentless. In this one I never felt stressed or anxious. I knew nothing bad would happen and no bombs would go off in any city. Where were scenes of the public freaking out that the world was ending? People would be losing their minds, there would be mass chaos, but no, none of that. If the world is about to end in a nuclear attack, I expect to be stressed, but never did I feel anything bad was going to happen. Also, at the end, they capture the Entity and all the power goes out all over the world. I'm like finally, something is happening, the internet has been destroyed and humanity will have to go on without electronics. But no, immediately all the power comes back on and it is like nothing ever happened with the Entity, everything goes back to normal immediately! What!?!? Are you kidding me!?!? Just terrible! An absolute disgrace to the franchise! And Angela Basset's character is just horrendous! I can barely watch any of the cringe worthy scenes she's in! I feel like they were trying to make a political statement, but alas, Kamala lost the election..."

          "content": "It is, in every sense, the final reckoning. The latest and allegedly final chapter of the Mission: Impossible saga detonates onto the screen not merely as a film, but as a demonstration-of will, of craft, and of Cruise's monomaniacal devotion to cinema as spectacle. One does not simply watch these stunts; one winces, exhales, and reconsiders the limits of human ambition. They are, in a word, phenomenal.This is not the tired choreography of superhero cinema. This is real velocity, real danger. Cruise flings himself through collapsing infrastructure and dives into chaos with an intensity that demands belief. These aren't just sequences; they're testaments to what film used to mean before it was eaten alive by green screens and complacency. The action? Fantastic. In both senses-exhilarating and faintly unbelievable.But when the thunder stills, and our operatives take refuge in dialogue, the film trips on its own ambition. The script is the weakest link: a mess of gravitas-laden one-liners and limp philosophical musings. There is little in the way of genuine wit or verbal play. Characters speak like walking mission statements. Were it not for the film's physical poetry, these scenes would drift into parody. I would gladly have given the film a ten, had its words lived up to its deeds.Yet to dismiss it as hollow would be a disservice. Beneath the wreckage and the bravado lies a grave and timely warning. Dead Reckoning is not just about bombs and betrayal-it is a parable of our age. It takes aim at artificial intelligence with an urgency that borders on prophetic. The Entity, a rogue intelligence beyond control or comprehension, is not merely a villain-it is a mirror. One that reflects our collective surrender to algorithms, to online groupthink, to the seductive annihilation of nuance.The film's preoccupation with AI is not gimmickry; it is a cinematic scream against our accelerating descent into techno-fatalism. In its grand, operatic fashion, it dares to ask what happens when the machines we built to predict us begin to replace us-and when truth itself becomes a casualty of consensus. Add nuclear stakes, and it becomes chillingly plausible.So, then. The final reckoning delivers not only thrill but thought. A flawed triumph, yes-but a triumph nonetheless."

I loved Hayley Atwell , she is fascinating, Simon Pegg was mature and responsible, I will miss these movies, I don't think that anyone could repeat this success, for me it resembles the Janes Bond movies and the way it ended."

          "content": "It's well-known by now that the modern 'Mission: Impossible' movies don't start shooting with a completed script. Instead of having an air-right blueprint from which to begin, Christopher McQuarrie takes a list of increasingly death-defying stunts curated by Tom Cruise and figures out a way to staple them together. It's no exaggeration that these films are held together by staples, superglue, duct tape and good will... and, sadly, that good will is finally starting to run out. Simon Pegg once described the process of making these features - at least all those post 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011)' - as building the train tracks while the train barrels down them, narrowly avoiding disaster by frantically creating a path that hasn't actually been predefined. On three occasions, this technique has somehow allowed the train to arrive at the right station completely (or, in the case of the third time, mostly) unscathed. The problem is that McQuarrie and co spectacularly sent the train barrelling off the rails and into a ravine at the end of the now-annoyingly titled 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)'. Not only have they officially run out of track, they've also significantly damaged their locomotive.As a result, the first hour of 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning (2025)' - the exhaustingly 'epic' and 'high-stakes' supposed climax to this long-running, and long-successful, franchise - is a bigger train wreck than that which capped off its somehow superior (yet still massively flawed) predecessor, and it isn't the kind of train wreck you can't take your eyes off. I'm not being dramatic when I say that the feature, which was my most anticipated of the year before its mixed reviews tempered my expectations (although they arguably didn't temper them enough), gets off to a terrible start. The Paramount logo plays on x2 speed, and I kind of wish the entire first hour did the same. It literally includes a fan-cam montage of previous features, coming across as obsessed with a canon that previously benefitted from being episodic rather than serialised. It tries its best to tie everything in its plot to something from a previous outing, preoccupied with crafting a feeling that \"everything has led to this\". But what exactly is \"this\"? It's so desperate to make even the least significant detail feel important and consequential, clumsily doing so to the detriment of its pacing and storytelling, that it forgets to craft a compelling narrative of its own. In fact, it doesn't really have a narrative of its own. Well, it does, but only the most barebones narrative imaginable. I'd say that around 30% of it is just footage from previous outings haphazardly spliced in as flashbacks, and an even higher percentage of it consists of people dropping on-the-nose exposition in irritatingly turn-based fashion while holding back tears because each and every line is soaked in forced gravitas and weight. There are no real characters, no arcs or themes. The human villain is a total loser, and the AI entity has none of the sense of dread or power it had in its first appearance (despite technically holding all the cards for most of the runtime). It's ironic that a picture about destroying an AI could easily have been written by one.The filmmaking itself isn't much better. Despite looking relatively nice in general and really shining when it gets to its infrequent set-pieces, it's all relatively flat and featureless. It has no style, no substance, no sense of humour or heart. It's a bit of a slog, to be honest, a relentless barrage of portent and doom that feels more like a funeral march than a celebration of a stellar series. A lot of it simply isn't fun. It's a real shame, too. The best bits are the little moments in which Ethan feels human, showcasing pain or fear or exhaustion, and the brief exchanges that crackle with energy and wit (Simon Pegg may be neutered, as is everyone else, but he's still the most lively person on screen). The score is repetitive and forced, constantly trying to convince you how epic and emotional everything is (or, at least, is meant to be), and the iconic theme plays too infrequently to get you hyped up for the feature's best scenes. The editing is notably poor, both in a macro and micro sense. Individual scenes have a tendency to bleed into one another, often feeling like one of those brief fake-out flashforwards from 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)' or 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)' but never being revealed as such. Something's just off about a lot of it, and even the earliest action scenes are choppy and unrefined. Plus, unless I completely misunderstood who was on screen at a certain point, it features one of the most glaring continuity errors I've seen (how did that woman get on the plane when she waved to it from the ice as it took off?). If I'm wrong about it (which I feel like I must be, but then again maybe I'm not), I'll happily concede that point; it still jerked me right out of the experience, though.One of the worst things about the picture is that it only has two real set-pieces. At nearly three hours in length, that's practically unacceptable. Where are the car chases? The shootouts? The fistfights? Where are the masks and gadgets? The satisfying rug-pulls and subversions? The scenes of Ethan running while Benji shouts frantic directions in his ear? Where's the espionage? More importantly, where's the fun? Sure, there's a brief bout in a submarine, a swift battle in a log cabin, a cut-short pursuit in a tunnel, and a brutal off-screen murder with a meat cleaver, but these snippets of action serve as mere distractions from the relentless exposition and sleepy close-ups and incessant positioning of Ethan as a messianic 'chosen one' figure. There should be way more pulse-pounding sequences considering the runtime; if an action movie is going to be this long, it should at least be action-packed. The reason why there aren't more set-pieces, of course, is likely because the few there are simply require too much dedication and too many resources to be replicated too often.I know I've spent a lot of time complaining about the affair, but I want to be clear that I don't hate it. I'm disappointed by it, sure, but I can't completely condemn a feature which includes one of the best action set-pieces I've ever laid eyes on. Make no mistake, this one does. While the submarine sequence features some stunning underwater cinematography and culminates in a truly compelling, typically what-can-go-wrong-does-go-wrong way, it does leave me a little cold overall due to its baggy pace and clumsy editing. It's a good segment, of course, but it isn't one of its series highlights. What is a series highlight, though, is the absolutely jaw-dropping biplane pursuit that caps off the narrative. Ethan Hunt clings to the bottom of a plane as it soars through the air, doing loop-de-loops and barrel rolls and straight-up inverted flying in an effort to send him hurtling to an early grave. You can practically feel your stomach drop out from under you as you see the gorgeous scenery shrink into the distance and our hero slips and slides along the surface of the vehicle as he almost magically defies gravity simply by completely understanding it. Although its final beat is somewhat misjudged and it isn't as compelling as it could have been because Gabriel is such a whiff of a baddie, it's still an edge-of-your-seat experience that has to be seen to be believed, an impressive feat of filmmaking and stunt work that cements Cruise as an adrenaline-fuelled genius and McQuarrie as an all-timer enabler who knows how to capture his star's audacity in the best way possible. Up in the air, these craftsmen prove their mastery and are at their absolute best. It's just a shame the stuff on the ground pales in comparison, and that you're only a hair's length away from being totally checked out by the time the biplanes come into play. Despite that, though, the finale alone could easily be considered a genuine reason to recommend - or, at least, sit through - the rest of the picture; it's so wholly immersive and astounding that it's worth the price of admission in and of itself, a bravura display of dedication and loose screws that cements itself as one of the action genre's most essential moments the second it appears on screen. It makes it very difficult to assign this honestly quite bad movie a negative score.Ultimately, this is definitely a disappointment considering how great it could have been given its series' track record and its promises to act as a suitable farewell to the IMF. Holistically, it's actually pretty poor. In fact, there's legitimately a strong argument to be made that it's the worst film in its series, and I'm including 'Mission: Impossible II (2000)' in that statement. Compartmentally, however, it's more complicated than that. Some parts of it are quite awful, some parts of it are mediocre, and some parts of it are absolutely brilliant. The bad bits may outnumber the good, but they don't outweigh them. If you're at all interested in seeing Cruise risk his life in one of his most terrific temptations of fate to date, then you should go see this on the big screen. Just be prepared to be bored for a while first, or perhaps even turn up a little late; you won't miss much. I wish I loved this movie. I'd even settle for liking it unabashedly. Sadly, though, I can only say I like some of it. To be fair, I might even love some of it. A single phenomenal set-piece doesn't make a good film, but it definitely goes a long way in making a mediocre one easy to recommend. I'm so torn on this feature. If I were tasked with declaring it a masterpiece or declaring it a failure, I'd only have one thing to say: \"Mission: Impossible\"."

          "content": "Starting with M:I:7, my reaction to the villain being this nebulous online entity was kind of weak. The convoluted story starts to get over-the-top campy like a big Bond film. And of course what's always at stake is nothing less than the end of the world \"As we know it\" (Yes somebody actually says that cliché phrase). We get into camp territory when Cruise get's in some chamber and talks to the \"Entity\". It reminded me of Terminator Salvation, which had the embodiment of AI as a face (á la Wizard of Oz). For me, that's the moment we enter cartoonland, and the feeling of real peril for our heroes subsides.Somewhere the principle purpose for this kind of film got lost in the filmmakers. We are here to see fun and inventive action sequences (or dynamic machinations of the plot). The filmmakers thought that by adding MacGuffin after MacGuffin, puzzle piece by puzzle piece, audiences would enjoy the plot even more. For me it was the opposite. M:I:7 started this whole mess, it ran 2 hours and 43 minutes, and that was only part 1. Now we are so much up to our neck in puzzle pieces that M:I:8 needs to spend the first hour just to explain it all.When the opposite thing should happen. I found at least three times after the film began that you could easily chop off a ton of the unnecessary exposition and literally cut to the chase. The filmmakers don't trust audiences to leapfrog over fluffy filler, and forces them to be spoonfed why we need to be concerned about one person or object after another. I realised later the plot was overwritten because of the dozens of characters we are supposed to keep track of. They all had to been something to do. The lady on the aircraft carrier, the guy from Parks and Recreation, Hayley Atwell and whatever she is supposed to be doing, the guy from Boardwalk Empire, and his cohort, the side characters keep piling up. The bad guy who looks like James Coburn never felt threatening enough to be memorable. Just compare to Philip Seymour Hoffman's wonderfully disturbing performance in M:I:3.So why bother with two hours of drivel when what we really came to see was the action? If this review was purely about how good the action scenes are then it would be a glowing review. Nobody denies that Tom Cruise rules the action universe by doing his own stunts and not compromising on complexity or difficulty. They are stunning and absolutely fun to watch.Marvel recently acknowledged how overbloated these tentpole films have become by releasing \"Thunderbolts\", clocking in just over 2 hours. M:I:8 runs an exhausting 2 hours and 49 minutes. One thing I will be forever grateful however, is that the composer laid to rest the \"bom bom ba ba bom bom, ba ba bom bom\" punchy theme from the original Mission Impossible TV show. After using that refrain time after time across three decades, it was becoming painful being forced to drill that theme it into my head again and again.So ultimately it pains me to rain on what has been a better franchise (compared to the likes of Fast and Furious), which was starting to overstay it's welcome. Perhaps a reboot will be successful, but for now, like the Bond franchise, it needs a rest. 6 out of 10. Points off for bloated exposition, the misguided idea that adding more and more makes it better, the cartoonish aspects of the plot, and the fact that Tom Cruise decided to push the franchise beyond it's life expectancy."

There are not one but two huge action sequences that simply outshine anything found in any other franchise. This is cinema meant for the big screen...the biggest and loudest you can find. This is not simply the last Mission Impossible movie, but possibly the last of its kind.That said, prepare for a different tone in this installment. The tone is far darker than any other in the series and the movie is thickly brushed with a sense of dread. I do think many will miss the wit and light touch that accompanies most of these films. This finale is different and is not interested in recycling some of that old magic. This film is carving out new ground with its serious approach and those ready for it will really enjoy this final installment. Those unwilling to accept the change in approach may have difficulty with this one.Ironically some have stated that the antagonist is far too much in the realm of science fiction while others have pointed to the fact that possibly the antagonist is far too topical and close to home for a popcorn blockbuster. I do think that the short time between Dead Reckoning and Final Reckoning has altered the way many of us view the dangers of AI. What possibly seemed like some distant silly recycled science fiction troupe has transformed into a reality that we are just beginning to grapple with. And possibly it is that change that ushered in the change in tone between the two films.M:I 8 is not a perfect movie but compared to the vast majority of stuff being made in Hollywood, it remains top notch."

Bloated script that dragged with irrelevant distractions. The sub and bi-plane scenes were too long and offset by painfully long plot explanations. Although typical dumb angry white males dominate, they are humanized a bit at the end. Another big issue was the real villain- Entity -was nearly absent. In part 1, Entity was omnipresent, visible, interactive. Basically this movie lacked Hunts humility, any realistically aged love interest ( like his wife of 30 yrs) and disciplined editing of the best MI movies."

One last time\"An ode to the exhilarating screen presence and the stunts of Tom Cruise, the closing chapter of the mission impossible series brings us an ensemble of all the characters of the previous films, teaming up to destroy an artificial intelligence computer known as the entity, which is planning to detonate all the nuclear missiles of the world simultaneously and plans to take over the world. The villain Gabriel snatches the core code needed to annihilate the machine and flees away. The hunt to save the world continues. Phenomenal stunt choreography, both of the plane and the underwater sequence were a treat to the eyes. Felt like a sendoff of Tom Cruise rather than a full fledged action movie with a groundbreaking screenplay. Worth paying a tribute!"

Never forget, our lives are not defined by any one action. Our lives are the sum of our choices. I haveClose to two decades ago, I chose to accept the choice, the choice of watching Mission Impossible films. Fast forward to now; I still can't believe this franchise is ending. Continuing Dead Reckoning's storyline, Ethan and his team try to use the acquired keys to get the source code in the submarine of the Sevastopol. Ethan has to destroy (or control) the Entity before it takes control of all the nations' nuclear power to destroy the world. One thing I really hate about this film is the flashbacks. The flashbacks to the previous films were fine, but I hated the flashbacks to Dead Reckoning. They took too long and were unnecessary, given they were only the previous film's. We also took too long in other scenes, maybe 20-30 minutes too long for this film. They also could have had a mention/glimpse of Agent Brandt (Renner's character). The ending was fine, but I wished it was more satisfying. Maybe we could have a mention of Julia and even Ilsa's death. I also don't know why Alanna wasn't present. Maybe it's because of her Sue Storm role. The decompression chamber scene also didn't make sense. It only fit one, but Grace went in as well.Ethan is great as always. I love seeing how he cares for his team and how he sacrifices himself, as Luther calls it, his calling. I did think that second parachute was ridiculous, though. Maybe they could have just killed him off in an epic way. Grace was once again really annoying. She has no personality and seems to be just a replacement for Ilsa. I very dearly missed Ilsa. Luther, for some reason, was made to have an unspecified illness. Luther's death was really emotional, and his final speech was great, but he was killed off too early. I loved how Ethan's last message was from him, though. Benji was given little to do for some reason. He also could have been offed to spark some emotional farewell. Paris should have been dead. She felt like she was just there in this movie and not doing much. I don't know why they kept her alive. The reveal of Jasper being Phelps' son was weird as well. I did like seeing William (the guy from the first film). Tillman as Captain Bledsoe was also scene-stealing. The villain, Gabriel, unfortunately, was once again mediocre and frustrating.The stunts were awesome again, as always. The submarine scenes are just really well done and breathtaking, even if they take a bit too long. The airplane scenes were phenomenal. I will truly miss stunt-making from Cruise. They're just brilliant works of film that should be more recognized. The action sequences are good. Seeing Ethan run for one last time was also fun and never gets old. However, I didn't like the continuous cuts and transitions in some scenes. The continuous cuts were just unnecessary and weirdly chosen. I also wanted more spy scenes, using masks and hacking, but I guess they aren't as applicable in the plot here.Similar to its predecessor, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is an impressive and thrilling yet underwhelming conclusion to the franchise. The messy plot and some questionable decisions on its characters hold it back from being a great action film for the ages. It does feature some of the best stunts and set pieces in the franchise, if not the best, along with great performances, action sequences, and other technical achievements, which are more than enough to entertain you for his last mission, should you choose to accept it. This review will self-destruct in 5 seconds."

In the end, all we got was a race for an ultra-tech macguffin, which has to connect to other macguffin, which can be found by using another macguffin, only then to use the final macguffin at the right timing to defeat the Entity. Sounds stupid and boring? It is. That is the price for having the enemy you can't see in the media, where everything is based on seeing."

There are some nice surprises along the way which incorporates former notable people from the franchise.In summary:\nA good movie but it felt somewhat unoriginal and maybe somewhat lacked direction. However, the interesting thing (and kudos to McQ) is the usage of AI. How are we as humans supposed to act with this tool in order to preserve not just a distance towards it, but also to not be enslaved by it.7/10 - A good movie but somewhat obvious conclusion (and surprising)."

          "content": "I have just seen Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, and oh my goodness-what an extraordinary experience. This franchise has long been one of my favourites, and this latest instalment only deepened my admiration. I've always adored the blend of high-stakes action and intricate storytelling, and this film delivers on both fronts with incredible finesse.One of the defining qualities of Mission: Impossible is, of course, Tom Cruise's breathtaking stunt work. These feats of physical daring have become a hallmark of the series, and they truly elevate each film. Watching him push the limits once again was thrilling-this, to me, is what makes Mission: Impossible so uniquely compelling.The Final Reckoning brought tears to my eyes. I cried-more than once. Despite knowing that Ethan Hunt would likely prevail in the end (as he always does), I still found myself genuinely afraid, nervous, and deeply moved. This emotional engagement is a testament to the film's storytelling, which balances the predictable heroism we love with real tension and heartfelt moments.What stood out to me most was the film's connection to the past. It beautifully incorporated callbacks and references to earlier instalments, enriching the narrative with a sense of nostalgia and continuity. The use of past characters and scenes was woven into the film in a way that felt both deliberate and respectful, creating a powerful emotional resonance.For years, I've had questions about Mission: Impossible III, particularly the mysterious \"Rabbit's Foot\". It was an unresolved plot point that lingered in my mind since I first watched it as a young viewer, even before secondary school. To my delight, The Final Reckoning finally addressed this mystery. It revisited earlier films, especially the first, and offered clarity on the Rabbit's Foot, tying it into the broader narrative arc. I found this immensely satisfying.The film's inclusion of a montage featuring characters and moments from previous instalments added yet another layer of emotional depth. This wasn't just a sequel-it was a culmination. I absolutely adored how it honoured the legacy of the franchise while delivering something new and impactful.In short, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning was everything I hoped for and more. It was thrilling, emotional, and deeply rewarding for long-time fans. I loved every moment of it.Sustainability Commentary:Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning was awarded the Green Seal by the Environmental Media Association, signalling that the production implemented certified sustainable practices. As a sustainable content creator and advocate, this is something I deeply appreciate. It is heartening to see large-scale, high-octane productions committing to environmentally conscious efforts behind the scenes.However, given the nature of the Mission: Impossible franchise-with its intense stunts, practical effects, and extensive use of vehicles such as cars, trains, and motorcycles-the environmental impact remains a crucial area of inquiry. These elements, while vital to the film's dynamic narrative, are traditionally fuel-intensive, often reliant on petrol or diesel, both of which are major contributors to carbon emissions.I am particularly interested in understanding the specific measures the production team undertook to reduce its carbon footprint. Did they utilise alternative fuels, carbon offsetting programmes, or newer sustainable technologies in stunt coordination and transport logistics? What strategies were employed to balance the demands of practical action sequences with a reduced environmental impact?Given Tom Cruise's well-known commitment to performing his own stunts, and the sheer scale of such a production, it would be insightful to see a detailed breakdown of the environmental strategies used. I would welcome a behind-the-scenes sustainability report or case study that transparently outlines how these challenges were approached.Productions of this calibre have the potential to set new industry standards-not only for cinematic spectacle, but also for environmental responsibility."

That cognitive work the audience has to make, might not be as entertaining as one can imagine, but it's the worth the concentration.In terms of soundtrack, the film has slight variations in its main score, slowing down the rythm, for example, and prioritizing an epic music in every fight, which causes the audience to stay glued to their seats.The final scene may not be as emotional as one might expect, Ethan saves the world once again but every congratulation he recieves, is a nod. It would have been a nice touch, for instance, to make Benji the one handling Hunt the Entity and hug him, rather than Grace and having Benji greet him from the distance. He has been a member of the IMF from the 3rd or 4th movie, that's a long time. That part fell short.Concerning the stunts, Cruise is still capable and in shape at his none other than 62 years old. We all know he makes his own stunts since the first installment of this saga, but flying a plane so close to the rocks and hanging from it when being at such a high altitude and enduring that sort of wind, is a whole other story.In summary, the conclusion to one of the most renown franchises in cinema industry is a must-watch if you want to feel the intensity of having to save the world from a malicious AI and see crazy stunts, along with moving performances from the main cast. It's a complex ride, but worth your time."

And what an end it was, following up on the pretty good Dead Reckoning and ultimately ending the saga of Ethan Hunt is no easy feet so does this film succeed? Yes. And no.To start with the positives, the action. It's spectacular. The two major set-pieces in this film are perhaps the best the franchise has to offer. Tom Cruise does it once again. The finale to this film fully delivers. The cast all deliver good performances and there are plenty of good moments of fan service.Unfortunately, this is a film of two halves and most of the positives are in the second half while the first half has all the negatives. McQuarrie's style is at its very worst here with boatloads of repetitive exposition, most of which is stuff we already know. The first act is also poorly paced, surprisingly poorly edited and incredibly bloated. It feels like a first draft. The problems of Dead Reckoning unfortunately carry over to this film with Gabriel still being a poor antagonist and the jarring decisions of DR leading to lacklustre character pay-offs in this one. However, this film does appropriately raise the stakes, and The Entity really feels scary in this one.Overall, I of course would recommend this film if you love Mission Impossible and action in general. You just have to wade through a sluggish first act/half. But it ends on a great note meaning you'll be walking out with a smile and sweaty palms."

          "content": "As a longtime fan of the Mission: Impossible series, I went into The Final Reckoning with sky-high expectations, and I'm thrilled to say it mostly delivered. This eighth installment, billed as the grand finale, is a wild ride that showcases Tom Cruise at his absolute peak, especially when it comes to those jaw-dropping stunts. While the film takes a bit to get rolling, once it does, it's an adrenaline-pumping spectacle that reminds me why I love this franchise.Let's start with Tom Cruise, who, at 62, continues to defy logic and gravity as Ethan Hunt. The man is a force of nature, and his commitment to performing his own stunts is nothing short of legendary. The standout moment for me-and I suspect for most audiences-is the biplane sequence. Watching Cruise cling to the wing of a 1930s Boeing Stearman at 10,000 feet, battling 140 mph winds, had my heart in my throat. There's a raw intensity to his performance as he crawls across the plane, his face contorted by G-forces, yet still conveying Ethan's unyielding determination. It's not just a stunt; it's a testament to Cruise's insane dedication to delivering authentic, edge-of-your-seat thrills. No CGI, no stand-ins-just Cruise, a plane, and sheer willpower. I couldn't help but marvel at how he makes the impossible look real, and this sequence alone is worth the price of admission.The rest of the film's action doesn't disappoint either. From a tense underwater submarine dive to high-octane chases, the set pieces are meticulously crafted, and Cruise's hands-on approach-flying planes, operating cameras, and throwing himself into danger-makes every moment feel visceral. He's not just a movie star; he's a one-man stunt crew, and I'm in awe of how he keeps pushing the boundaries of what's possible.That said, I have to admit the first hour of the movie felt a bit sluggish. It's heavy on exposition, with a lot of dialogue about the AI villain, The Entity, and flashbacks tying together the franchise's sprawling history. As someone who's followed Ethan Hunt's adventures for years, I appreciated the nods to earlier films, but the pacing dragged with all the setup. It felt like the movie was trying too hard to tie up loose ends, and I found myself itching for the action to kick in sooner. Thankfully, once it does, around the one-hour mark, the film shifts into high gear and never looks back.The supporting cast-Hayley Atwell, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and newcomers like Hannah Waddingham-brings heart and humor, though the spotlight rightfully stays on Cruise. The story, while convoluted at times, keeps the stakes high, and the emotional weight of this being the \"final\" chapter (though I'm skeptical it's truly the end) adds a bittersweet edge. The climactic plane chase through South Africa's canyons is pure cinematic magic, blending nail-biting suspense with Cruise's daredevil charisma.Overall, Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is a thrilling, if slightly uneven, send-off for Ethan Hunt. The slow start holds it back from perfection, but Tom Cruise's superhuman stunt work, especially that insane biplane sequence, makes it a must-see on the biggest screen possible."

I may have more recency bias as I just did a marathon last summer. I watched this movie in IMAX in Yongsan, Korea. I have to say watching it in IMAX added 0.5 points to a 3.5 movie. It really does upgrade the movie by making it more immersive.The Reckoning installments overall felt the least impactful in terms of villains. A good hero story always needs a good villain and the Entity and Gabriel are NOT it. Not having a physical form does impact the stake (although they inflated the dangers of the Entity by pure exposition) and Gabriel was not even technically on the Entity's side in Final Reckoning. He is very not threatening at all. The overall stake was not very convincing - why would the Entity want to annihilate humans? Even after watching both of the films, I felt like that was not very clearly answered, hence lacking motive.Despite that, the movie is still a convincing watch. The two main stunts being the underwater scene and the plane scene were very solid. I just couldn't believe Tom Cruise actually held onto a flying plane like that. It was ridiculous. The submarine scene required a bit more suspension of disbelief because I was pretty sure a human couldn't possibly survive that. Man is a true master of his craft, even at his age. I respect him as an actor very much. This franchise would not exist if he were not 100% committed to his role as he has been.There were tons of callbacks to previous MI installments, which was a worthy nod to the franchise. I loved that they reintroduced the guy from #1. He was the symbol for how the IMF's seeming destruction for the sake of the mission provided more good than harm overall. Collateral damage for the sake of not harming those close to him.It is truly the end of an era for such a huge franchise to end. I don't see this coming back for a long time as Cruise was so iconic and may be a little less replaceable unlike Bond franchise. We shall see."

I was nearly about to straight up leave during the first 30 ish minutes due to just how janky it was in editing and writing. Luckily that was shortly followed by what may now be one of my favorite sequences in cinema ever! There is one absolutely amazing, probably 15-20 minute long sequence towards the middle of the film, that is absolute pure gold. The cinematography, stakes, and action were all perfect and divine.But my issue is that it was able to achieve such a feat, whilst also having one of the worst intros I've ever seen in a modern high profile film.I don't know, I'd personally watch it just for the middle of the movie again, but the movie was overall just really fun, but definitely not a story movie.

          "content": "Since the Cold War, where the enemy was the Russian nuclear threat, it's continued to evolve as technology advances. In Tenet (2020), The Algorithm Is The Baddie. And this Mission Impossible, the Villain is a rogue AI agent named the Entity, that can destroy mankind. Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) world-saving mission, which he accepts, is to destroy the Entity by locating its source code. And, of course, only Hunt has the skill-set and bravura to complete this mission. It turns out the only copy of the source code is located in a submarine at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. Every software engineer knows better: there are always backup copies of every program. Hunt, along with his IMF team ( Rhames, Pegg and Atwell) have to overcome many obstacles to locate and destroy the Entity. When Hunt makes it to a US Navy submarine, you'd expect the crew, including Navy Seals and expert deep-sea divers would be better qualified than Hunt, who's sort of a generalist secret agent. But no, only Hunt is chosen. At several points, Hunt dives into the 30F waters of the Arctic Ocean. At that temperature, the water is dangerously close to freezing and hypothermia would set in within minutes. Even then, they have to manage \"cold shock,\" which can cause an involuntary potentially deadly gasp reflex. But, of course, none of this happens to our superhero Ethan Hunt. The story continues to get more and more improbable. The grand finale is a high-speed aerial battle with Hunt leaping from his biplane onto the enemy's biplane, knocking the enemy out. The stakes are higher than ever, as Ethan retrieves a \"digital poison pill\"\nthat shuts down the Entity for good."

But we will have to wait on that issue, because they usually have a way of making more sequels when a movie makes money, like this one is sure to do. Tom returns as Ethan Hunt, fearless leader of the IMF that tangle jobs that the regular government agencies can't handle. Haley is a newer recruit to the team-Tom and Ving Rhames are the only 2 cast members in all 8 movies-and Esai is still the villain from 2023's Dead Reckoning that wants to use an AI called the Entity to control the world, under his power, of course. Angela plays the US President that has a tuff decision to make; wait and see if Tom can save the world again or will she have to launch nuclear missiles against every country in the world, that would save the US but kill lots of other people. It's never boring but it is almost 3 hours long. There are flashbacks to previous films that fill in a few plot wholes scattered between the action and stunts, and there is one major fatality for the IMF team-they will not be back for any sequels...I mean IF there are any sequels. Ha HA. Yeah right.It's rated PG-13 for action, violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.I thoroughly enjoyed this instalment in the franchise and I would buy it on Blu-Ray. Trust Tom, one last time...."

The under water and airplane scene are like none other you would have seen. Tom cruise is brilliant as always but so is the rest of the cast. It can feel a bit dark and gloomy at times but that's the reality they are trying to depict with nuclear war at risk. Great they brought back some of the characters from the past.

          "content": "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning is supposedly Tom Cruise's final outing in the franchise. I absolutely adore the Mission: Impossible series, and in my opinion, there hasn't been a truly \"awful\" entry. Even the second film has its charm, and while the previous installment, Dead Reckoning, had its issues, it was still a fun ride. So, does The Final Reckoning provide a satisfying conclusion to the franchise?Let's start with the main reason you watch these movies: the action. The Final Reckoning continues to deliver top-tier action set pieces! The plane scene featured in all the posters and trailers is just as phenomenal as you'd expect. The tension is palpable, and the fact that Tom Cruise performed the stunt for real allows for some breathtaking shots and stunt work. Another standout set piece is the submarine sequence, which is completely different in tone and setting. It's a 10-15 minute anxiety-inducing sequence where Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) navigates a claustrophobic environment, trying not to get drowned or crushed. There's also a great fight scene involving not just Ethan, but his entire team. What makes it stand out is the editing-the film seamlessly switches between Ethan's and his team's fights in different locations, creating a smooth, well-paced sequence.All the returning actors deliver strong performances. The plot comes with significantly higher stakes, which means fewer jokes, but this allows for more emotionally charged performances. Ving Rhames returns as Luther and delivers the film's most powerful moment. Pom Klementieff and Greg Tarzan Davis return as Paris and Theo respectively, and their evolving dynamic offers an interesting new perspective on their characters. Angela Bassett also returns as Erika, last seen in Fallout, and though her screen time is limited, she gives a top-tier performance. The plot overall is fine for the most part, and I appreciate that The Final Reckoning ties up a major loose end from one of the earlier films. Bringing back Rolf Saxon from the original Mission: Impossible was a great touch and his role is surprisingly substantial.However, the film's first act suffers from poor pacing. Much of it is spent reminding the audience of events from previous installments. While I understand that not everyone may have recently rewatched the series, this constant reminder feels like a needless waste of runtime. It also lacks the kind of exciting stunts that you would usually have in the first act of a Mission Impossible film. At 170 minutes, the movie is far too long, and could have benefited greatly from trimming a lot of scenes. Mission: Impossible plots have always been over-the-top, but usually manage to stay somewhat grounded. The Final Reckoning, however, borders on the nonsensical. The idea that the AI, known as \"The Entity\" from Dead Reckoning, could impact the entire world is so extreme that it becomes almost laughable. I also wish the film explored more of Ethan's mysterious past, but unfortunately, that thread remains untouched.Esai Morales returns as Gabriel, the villain from Dead Reckoning, who was teased as having a deep personal connection with Ethan. If you were hoping that dynamic would be fleshed out, prepare to be disappointed. Gabriel is a weak villain. The film never explains his motivations or his history with Ethan. He simply acts like a cartoonish, moustache-twirling bad guy with no real depth. The film also introduces far too many new characters, which feels like an odd choice for a supposed final chapter. As a result, returning supporting characters like Kittridge (Henry Czerny) and Jasper (Shea Whigham) have significantly less to do than in the previous movie. The ending is also somewhat underwhelming-not the satisfying, climactic conclusion you'd expect from a franchise finale.Overall, The Final Reckoning is one of my least favourite Mission: Impossible films. The first hour drags it down, and the plot isn't as engaging as it could have been. That said, it's still better than most action movies out there. Tom Cruise risking his life to bring us jaw-dropping set pieces is worth the price of admission alone. If this truly is his final time playing Ethan Hunt, there are certainly worse ways to go out."

As an audience feeling fatigued by so much similarity of end of the world series. Seems like hollywood is just milking on franchise and does not want to risk any new way of story telling. Dont want to distrub the pattern, playing safe. Was more of mission tiring and i will choose not to accept the next installment unless something creative."

Like the Rocky franchise, MI has become ever more dependent on the goodwill of fans who will accept a few failings to get to the payoff. This is of course a vanity venture for Cruise who, never forget, almost single-handedly destroyed the Reacher franchise. (Which amazingly is somehow surviving as a Canadian-made series). Also a nice touch, for those of us with long memories, we who used to watch the original series on the then-rare color TV sets, to grant the late Bruce Geller a front-line credit. This really should end the franchise. Seriously.

One of the problems with movies like this is that we know the good guys will succeed, no matter how much of the supporting cast bites the dust. It plays hob with suspense. Surely we don't need this much time to achieve a foregone conclusion.Still, for what it is, it's very well done."

I don't regret going to see it for a second. It's a high-quality film, and you can really tell it was made with love for the audience.That said, something did bother me-the plot and the pacing.Let's start with the plot. I felt like too many concepts were being thrown at me, and I was expected to keep up. Every few scenes there's another bit of exposition that's hard to follow (not for the first time, by the way-this has always been the franchise's Achilles' heel), and you just wait for the character who will ask the question that translates all the jargon into plain English.This film is a bit more complicated to understand. There were moments when I looked at the screen and thought, \"I have no idea what's going on right now or why the characters are in this situation,\" and all I could do was keep watching and hope it would make sense eventually.The pacing also threw me off. This is the film with the least amount of action in the series since the early ones. That bothered me a bit because I expected a certain standard.Still, there were plenty of great things. The acting and visuals are flawless. The action scenes are fantastic-especially the underwater sequence, which was breathtaking (get it? Because it's underwater... never mind)-and the entire final act.And of course, Israel was mentioned several times, which gives the film extra points in my book.It's a good ending for the franchise, and I definitely enjoyed it.And of course-I survived almost 3 full hours without a bathroom break! That's a real Mission: Impossible :-)"

          "content": "Whenever a film playing in theaters is introduced by one of the members of the picture's creative team, it's a safe bet that it doesn't live up to its pre-release hype. (Indeed, in all the years I've watched movies theatrically, that's been the case every time with just two exceptions.) And, regrettably, that's very much the case in this final installment in this long-running franchise. To put it simply, \"Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning\" is an offering with a lot of problems, the biggest of which being the decision to split the story into two parts in the first place. As it stands, the narrative could have easily been condensed down to a single release. But, if the producers truly wanted to make two films to close out the franchise, they could have readily done so by making two distinct stand-alone pictures instead of trying to tie this offering to its predecessor, \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One\" (2023), considering that the nexus between them is tepid at best. As a consequence, though, this two-film package makes for a needlessly long 5½-hour story that could have been told in much less time with some judicious editing. This suggests that milking the box office had to have been a strong incentive for how this project ultimately played out. And, even if that wasn't the case, the least the creators could have done was to tell a better story: While the first part did a reasonably capable job of holding viewer interest, that's out the window here with its many well-crafted but decidedly overlong action sequences (a la the most recent \"Indiana Jones\" offering (2023)); a story that elevates comparatively minor characters to unexplained relevance; under-utilizes the talents of several gifted cast members (e.g., Nick Offerman and Janet McTeer) while leaving others out entirely (where's Vanesa Kirby's White Widow, a character who played a key role in the first part?); and requires comprehensive audience familiarity with both the franchise's complete mythology, as well as in-depth knowledge of the intricacies of AI technology. Most importantly, however, many plot elements of the picture go beyond being \"impossible\" to \"wholly implausible\" or even \"difficult to accept,\" with numerous scenes that are full of holes, rely on convenient contrivances or seem completely unfathomable. \"Final Reckoning\" even \"borrows\" elements from other movie narratives (most notably \"Fail Safe\" (1964) and \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1991)) that strain its efforts at originality. There's also an almost self-congratulatory aspect to the production thanks to the inclusion of numerous flashback clips to previous installments in the franchise, introduced with somewhat tangential tie-ins, a cinematic stroll down memory lane that adds little (the film's inspired reintroduction and effective use of CIA operative William Donloe (Rolf Saxon) from the franchise's first release (1996) notwithstanding). In the end, however, this release misses the mark in myriad ways, and that even includes a rather lame conclusion that comes across as stretched out and unsatisfyingly anticlimactic (and that could have been handled better and differently in several alternate scenarios). In my view, this collection of blatant shortcomings is not the way to wrap up a storied franchise like this. I firmly believe that it should have come to an end with the release of \"Mission: Impossible - Fallout\" (2018), handily the best of the eight features in this series. Indeed, going to the well one (or two!) too many times can tarnish a mythology's legacy, and \"Mission: Impossible\" is one such venture. It genuinely deserves to go out with a bang and not a whimper. Unfortunately, though, in this case, the latter is reality, and that's truly a shame."
