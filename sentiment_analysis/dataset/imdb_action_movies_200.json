        "content": "Original, exciting and intelligent! You've never seen Jason Statham in a movie like this before... is something I won't be saying about 'A Working Man' or probably any future Statham movie. You can easily fill in the all too familiar blanks. Jason is an ex____ who has put those days behind him. Now he must return to his old ways and rescue _____ while kicking the bad guys asses along the way.The first act bolts out of the gate at a rapid pace, so fast in fact, I thought I was watching the trailer.A lot of the dialogue was inaudible, maybe because of the British people doing bad American or Russian accents. Which would explain why most of the film was trying to pass off England as Chicago.I was never sure if it was being played for laughs, with sudden dramatic head turns and theatrical musical stings. Making it all feel a bit camp - especially when the villains are dressed as vampires or like they've fallen into a lost property box.Thanks to co-screenwriter Sylvester Stallone, you're pummelled with cliche after cliche, desperately trying to emulate the classic action movies of the 80's but missing the target by a mile. The unintentionally funny scenes do deliver some laugh out loud moments which make the experience more bearable. I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting to be more entertained than I was.So, If you enjoy Statham being Statham and aren't in the mood for something new, then by all means, knock yourself out and give this a go.Nick@WatchItWombat.",

        "content": "Jason Statham plays the same character that he does in every other one of his movies, of course, but A Working Man is more of a Steven Seagal-like straight-to-video effort, i.e. An extra dumb plot, big plot holes, cartoonish characters, over-the-top acting, and of course Statham has to say things like \"I don't want any trouble\" before beating the crap out of everyone. I could probably write a book about all the dumb things that are said in this movie, but I'll just give one: When a mother's daughter is kidnapped by a Russian crime mob, the police tell her \"they don't pursue these cases.\" Ok well, I guess vigilante justice is our only option then.",

And of course, he's invulnerable. I almost forgot. üòâ. Very much in vogue: a young, smart and powerful woman who was placed at his side so that the male audience wouldn't fall asleep.The only thing missing was for him to catch the flying bullets with his teeth. So, for a possible second part, one could add more. For the faint-hearted, the film exudes a fair amount of cultural pessimism. The theme of \"I scare you, and then I'm the hero who saves you\" is inherent in American films. As such, the plot is rather one-dimensional and not for people who prefer a more complex way of thinking. Nevertheless, we felt thoroughly entertained at the end of the film and deeply impressed by the many close-ups of Statham's heroic face.",

It's formulaic, filled with odd characters who feel right out of a Netflix movie, and in very few ways entertains. David Harbour and Michael Pena are barely in the film, obviously there for the paycheck. Ayer is far from his Fury days, directing mostly from handheld, so every scene has an unnecessary amount of shaking. And then there's the odd mishmash of different inspirations it draws from: it wants to have the deep backstory of John Wick along with its fashion sense. It even borrows elements from Nosferatu if you can believe it. Statham is once again playing half of his talents, locked up in a story co-written by Stallone, which might explain some of its whackier elements. I'd wait to see A Working Man until it hits digital as it's just too weird and so poorly acted, but be prepared to wonder afterwards if you wasted two hours of your life taking a chance on this utter disappointment.",

        "title": "In an action movie, the star will always be above the script.",
        "content": "When it comes to a film starring an action star, things like an excellent script or a good story are somewhat irrelevant, and it's a fact that you can make a very enjoyable film without the need for those elements, unless you want to raise the stakes. Jason Statham's films are no exception, and most of his films simply seek to offer a pleasant dose of action for action movie fans. A Working Man is an action thriller adapted from an obscure novel titled Levon's Trade, which Sylvester Stallone himself was interested in adapting. It was initially planned as a television series, but was later changed to a feature film, condensing the original story and adapting it into a conventional action film.This film takes on some typical action thriller clich√©s, such as kidnapping, trafficking, the Russian mafia, and an ex-soldier returning to the battlefield. The opening credits sequence explains without much fuss who Levon was, and at the beginning of the film, it's clear that he's a former soldier who just wants a normal life. We see that things aren't going well for him, having lost his wife, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and his father-in-law doesn't consider him fit to take care of little Merry. Levon is a man who, by chance, returns to combat when he has to rescue Jenny after she's been kidnapped. The rest of the film is no different from Taken, as Levon uses his cunning to find Jenny. The film focuses heavily on suspense and intrigue at the beginning, and the action later becomes more evident when Levon must use force to confront his opponents. The film doesn't give much information about the Russian mafia and only drops a couple of hints that it's a powerful organization. This represents a great challenge for Levon and could offer something very fascinating to explore. The script certainly isn't excellent, but that's made up for with the action scenes. Some are very brief, but most are promising. The action is what matters most and is what makes a Jason Statham film worthwhile. Here, it's clear that Stallone has decided to pass the mantle to Statham, and it's something that was expected since they worked together on The Expendables. Although there's no denying that with The Transporter, Statham proved he was destined to be an action star. This film might not have worked without Jason Statham, so he's the one who saves the film in the same way he did with The Meg.A Working Man may not be one of Jason Statham's best films, but it's still a pretty enjoyable film. That's something only true fans of Jason Statham or action movies will appreciate. It's a film that can't be measured by its writer, but by all the action moments where it's always nice to see Statham being the action hero he's always been. My final rating for this film is 8/10.",

        "content": "Seriously, just watch The Beekeeper. You'll just get repeatedly stung here.This carbon copy movie of all other Jason Statham films also reminded me of the long list of Steven Seagal and Liam Neeson cookie cutter films. So, as a positive, if you love those Leave-Your-Brain-at-the-Door action/revenge/justice films, this 1,516th version is for you!Terminator Statham successfully left his expert military life behind him until the Russian Mob (is there another kind?) took his boss's daughter. What is he to do? Oh, yeah, John Wick/Bryan Mills/The Transporter himself to get the girl back.What sucked about this version of the same ole story was the disgustingly bad editing. I would absolutely expect this in a later Seagal or Sylvester Stallone film where they're either out of shape to be the same perfect martial artist or simply too old. Here we barely saw ANY of the action with the film's quick edits/zoom-ins.Jason Statham does NOT appear to be that old and definitely not carrying a Thor Dadbod. I know he's not Transporter 1 age, but I'm sad to not at least see some incredible Statham action, choreographed scenes.The movie sported unintentionally hilarious outfits, clich√©s aplenty, a story so predictable you have the movie pegged at minute 1 and the movie's climax ends abruptly with a laugh-out-loud scream. And what was with the victim who was never introduced as a Lara Croft fighter, suddenly able to Black Widow herself out of many situations?That all said, it wasn't the worst I'd ever seen. Of the rare action scenes that zoomed out, they were fun. And all that unintentional laughter did add to the enjoyment.Totally not recommended, but it could've been a lot worse. Still, this working man needs to be unemployed.***Final Thoughts: I watch a YouTube channel where they always comment on \"the Bruce Almighty Moon\" whereas whenever the moon appears huge on screen, it's as if Jim Carrey's God-Character pulled it in. I have never, EVER seen the moon look this big in ANY movie, including Bruce Almighty or even Moonfall. It's as if finding the girl was the least bit of worry for everyone in this universe. That moon, that looked like it was about collide with Earth, probably should've been the real threat.",

        "title": "A Working Man - A Vengeance and Justice Man",
        "content": "Jason Statham and director David Ayer reunite for A Working Man, following their success with The Beekeeper- another adrenaline-fueled ride. This time, they dive into the dark world of human trafficking, and the result is a relentless action thriller that pulls no punches. In his usual no-nonsense fashion, Statham dishes out swift and brutal justice, making every fight sequence feel personal and punishing.Scripted by Sylvester Stallone and based on Chuck Dixon's Levon's Trade (the first of 12 excellent, fast-paced books which I recommend - they are short novels with lots of action), the film sets the stage for what could be a long-running franchise. Statham's character, Levon Cade, is a former black ops operative trying to live a quiet life- until evil finds him first. One of the film's most memorable moments comes when Cade warns a trafficker, \"You had your chance to walk away. Now I take everything.\" Moments later, the audience is treated to a bone-snapping, full-throttle takedown that leaves no doubt: he means it.Ayer's signature grit and Stallone's old-school action sensibilities make A Working Man more than just another Statham beatdown; it's a raw, relentless tale of vengeance and justice. If this is only the beginning, action fans should buckle up for the ride ahead. Don't listen to the naysayers; this is a great old-school meets new-school action popcorn flick.",

        "content": "The Good: Jason Statham. Jason Flemyng. Michael Pena. David Ayer. Sylvester Stallone's retro 80's script. All on paper, at least. So, nothing, really.The Bad: Cinematography. Editing. Direction. Weak script. Atrocious dialogue. Poor characterisation. Overly convoluted and derivative plot. ADHD pacing.The Verdict: As mentioned above, the cast, crew, and plot sound awesome on paper, but everyone involved in this movie is just phoning it in. It's both frustrating and heartbreaking given it's potential. I love David Ayer's previous work in both directing (Fury, End of Watch, and even Suicide Squad) and screenwriting (Training Day, The Fast & The Furious (2001)), but fear that a certain studio's interference in one of those (no prizes for guessing which) has left him both disillusioned and broken as a filmmaker. David Ayer wants to be Tony Scott, but has somehow relegated himself to doing Michael Winner-esque revenge thrillers (see last year's The Beekeeper if you don't believe me), which hurts me more, as the late Michael Winner made some decent films in the past (The Jokers, Death Wish, The Nightcomers, Dirty Weekend (THE proto-feminist revenge thriller)). The Michael Winner comparison continues as Jason Statham (who has an awesome filmography including Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Revolver, Jet Li's The One, The Bank Job, Crank, Blitz, The Meg, and Wrath of Man (Guy Ritchie's far superior effort compared to this)) has now earned the unofficial Charles Bronson (the late actor) of today Award. The film itself is like a pastiche of Man on Fire (2004), Taken, and Road House without doing anything original or different. It's as if Sly Stallone wrote the screenplay (based on the novel Levon's Trade by Chuck Dixon) in the 1980's, sat on it for 40 years, and gave it to David Ayer to punch it up throwing in cell phones, Tinder (still a thing, really?) and Emoji references (what?!). Then there's the editing that would give Michael Bay a Grand Mal seizure, and the continuity is all over the place. Pay ¬£15 to see this lame and tame garbage peeing on the silver screen or wait a month and have it defecate on your face in the comfort of your own home? Hollywood seriously need to look in the mirror while they cut their nose off to spite their face, as they're destroying a lot of filmmakers and theatres in the process (their bread and butter!). You've been warned... unless you're Gen-Z in which case, you might have a blast. God only knows what Snow White (2025) must be like to lose money to this crap.",

From the moment the flashy opening title sequence starts, it's clear this is going to be almost hilariously straight faced and better for it.Surprisingly, there's a pretty eccentric cast of villains here however, it always remains Jason Statham's movie and him doing his usual extremely serious shtick carries this one as usual. Once again, he's playing squarely to his strengths and it's seriously impressive how him playing this type of character for the umpteenth time doesn't feel anywhere near as stale as when his fellow contemporaries stay in their respective lanes.David Ayer's direction isn't as strong as his efforts in last year's The Beekeeper whilst keeping the film consistently visually slick despite a couple of weird creative flourishes. The action is unexpectedly choppy when also compared to Ayer and Statham's last collaboration, saved by the stuff that's still easy to see and a wild action packed finale. The overdone score by Jared Michael Fry really helps to nail the throwback feel this is going for.",

The film is produced and co written by Sylvester Stallone and stars Jason-also a producer-as Levon, an ex military man just trying to lead a normal life, when he is forced back into his old life.

The story is predictable and trite.

He looks and acts the part, and the way he can impart elements of comedy without diminshing the vibe is mesmerizing. For example - even when he's interrogating someone or getting ready to break someone's nose, he can make you smile and laugh with a one-liner or even a mere glance. I just don't know how anyone could watch a Statham movie and not find him likable. When you watch this movie, you just can't help but get behind his character and pull for him to come through unharmed. I love the scenes involving him and his character's daughter tooThe movie has some good fighting scenes, as most Statham movies do. The villains are alright,. I do feel that the missing girl brings down the film a few times. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that we see her kick some butt and do other things to appear brave or charming. Instead, she came off as annoying. Nobody buys that this little girl could fight, and seeing her act brave and fearless in front of the villains took some magic off Statham's actions: Statham seems less brave when he confronts the bad Russian mafia because we see a little girl stand up to them. The girl should've played the scared and helpless damsel in distress7.5/10.",

        "content": "For full disclosure, this was the third film I watched at the cinema and having already sat through \"A Minecraft Movie\" I was flagging. A film this perfunctory and pedestrian was not what I was hoping for.Levon Cade (Jason Statham) is an ex-Royal Marines commando, now working construction for the Garcia family. When their daughter, Jenny (Arianna Rivas) is kidnapped from a bar, Cade decides to rescue her. His quest takes him from low level drug dealers, all the way up to Russian mafia bosses, as he kills his way closer to his goal.The problem is, whilst there's nothing particularly wrong with \"A Working Man\" there's also nothing particularly good, or perhaps better said, nothing particularly interesting about the film either. It feels like it's made on autopilot with a staid 'kill your way to the top' storyline and mostly rote characters. I say mostly because, as you might imagine, David Harbour is capable of making something relatively interesting out of a supporting role as a blind solder, who served with Cade, and helps him on his mission.I wasn't surprised to see that the film was made in the UK. Jason Flemyng is particularly unconvincing and massively underused as a Russian mobster, you have Emmett Scanlan is a fairly major role and there is a key turn for British TV stalwart Kenneth Collard. Perhaps the most depressing aspect of the film is that David Ayer now seems to have settled into a rut of mid-price, mid-ambition, mid-quality action films.Again, doesn't do anything notably bad - but less than 24 hours later and I can already barely remember it.",

You know what you're going to get, and it's not subtlety. True to form, there's none here. Instead, there's the first half of Taken (tracking down a kidnap victim) and the second half of John Wick (slaughtering a never-ending succession of anonymous soear-carriers).And that's part of this film's downfall. With a couple of exceptions, none of the baddie kill victims actually matter - they are simply crash test dummies and their \"deaths\" carry no weight whatsoeverBut the big flaw is the script, which was co-written by Sylvesrer Stallone. The conflict between returning to his past and losing access to his daughter, a potentially major emotional plot element - resolved by heaving Grandpa out of a burning building. The backstories of his history with construction boss and blind pal in the woods - mentioned but not addressed. What the kidnapped daughter was kidnapped for and went through - covered vaguely but never spelled out. How the tracking down through various layers of Russian Mafia was carried out - again, vague. You kind of got the idea about some of it but...The script needed work. The subplot about his daughter could have been cut completely. And the tracking down should have been thought through and set out much more clearly.This was disappointing.",

Jason Statham seldom disappoints in an action thriller, I'm a fan of his so was always likely to get the required fun out of this.Statham is great, naturally without him the movie would be vastly less entertaining. Away from the former British diver (still can't quite believe that's the same guy!), there are too many characters - which is one of the issues I have. There didn't need to be so many peeps in this.Even so, those onscreen are all decent enough and none register as overt negatives in my mind. David Harbour does well in a small role, he usually speaks the same way in roles but this feels minorly different. Michael Pe√±a and Arianna Rivas are solid, as is Jason Flemyng.The latter's character should've be the only bad guy in this, or at least one of a few. He gives enough that we didn't need anyone else in my opinion, especially as 'higher-ups' Andrej Kaminsky and Maximilian Osinski give weaker performances. Chidi Ajufo is the best of the rest.My other issue lies with the run time. I guess with so many characters it did need to be almost two hours in length, however you could've told this story within 90 minutes without a doubt. But again, as noticeable as that and the other issue is, it at least doesn't hinder much for me.",

His movies are usually intense brutal action scenes, gritty storylines and highly entertaining. What I will say though, this movie is quite over the top but David Ayer manages to make this movie believable and it makes you think \"could this really happen somewhere out in this world?\" The casting was excellent, excellent performances from all casting members. I will give this movie an overall rating 9/10. The story line is good but simple but what makes this movie good is the screenplay and the action scenes were done extremely well. Im not sure if there was any CGI used but cinematically everything looked good and real. Also the dialoque was quite good. Probably one of the best action/crime movies IMO in my own personal top 10 list. Go see this movie if you like good combat action scenes and an intense thrill ride. Not a dull moment.

Now that premise would be fine if the execution of it is top notch. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this film that you haven't seen done 10x better in 1000 other films throughout the 80's, 90's and 2000's. Villains that are boring, forgettable and barely developed. I couldn't tell you what Statham's character's name was in the film as the film never makes it important for you to know it. The story never takes any real risks or surprised me. You have both good guys and bad guys that INSITS that they are more badass then they really are. There are things in the story like warring factions or secret societies pulling strings that are clearly taken from the world building of John Wick and yet it is either barely explained or poorly executed. Where John Wick reminded audiences of the importance of well choreographed action with good cinematography to follow it and editing that lets a scene breath and naturally flow from one to the next, the action in this film is edited all over the place. Many of the actions scene are done through editing which when they are not jarring, they feel sloppy and you can't grasp what is going on. If John Wick is the Glass of Refined Aged Whisky and a well crafted meal, A Simple Man is the Burgers, Fries and cheap beer version.",

When the daughter of a close friend vanishes however, he find himself returning to the skills that made him a quote 'mystic figure in the shadowy world of counter-terrorism'.If Taken, John Wick, or Equaliser came to mind during the opening paragraph, then you would be correct in finding the glaring similarities to each of these franchises. The major differences are that A Working Man comes well over a decade too late, and lacks any possible depth or subtlety. That being said, switch off your brain and this is an adequate action thriller, complete with wince-worthy kills, terrific action, and some witty one liners. The star-studded cast bring up some of the funniest moments, including Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels legend Jason Flemyng, who delivers a lovingly stereotypical Russian mob boss, and Statham himself, who fits into the role of Levon like a comfy pair of slippers.

        "content": "\"The Beekeeper\" was a film I thought would be hilariously bad. Instead, it subverted my expectations by being a fun, solid actioner. Even on rewatch in preparation for \"A Working Man,\" it hasn't lost its sharp edge. I also consider Jason Statham among my Top 2 favorite action stars alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. Unfortunately, as a Statham fan, I was disappointed, but it may work for you. My criticisms may be your highlights, hopefully.Even in a mediocre film, Jason Statham always clocks into work, and Levon Cade is no exception. Whether it's his superb fighting skills or his ability to make weak dialogue sound 100 times better, and I'll get to the screenplay, Statham never manages to underdeliver.Next, while not as fun or as present as \"The Beekeeper,\" the action was (mostly) enjoyable. That can be because of Statham and the solid directing from David Ayer. Many of the action scenes were riveting, and one motorcycle chase scene is one I'll likely remember.Outside of that, some lines of dialogue were funny and powerful, Shawn White's cinematography was great, and, as I said, David Ayer does a strong job directing-wise.As much as I wanted to like it, there are too many flaws that I can't overlook.To start, the screenplay from David Ayer and Sylvester Stallone was weak. If I had any concerns beforehand, Stallone was one of them. He's far from a bad writer, penning the scripts of installments in The Expendables and Rambo franchises. However, I feared that this film would parallel some of their plot points, and they do, especially \"Rambo: Last Blood,\" given that Cade must save his boss's daughter from human traffickers. Aside from the action in the final act, I don't like that franchise closer, but \"A Working Man\" is better.The screenplay creates a story I didn't get invested in. Maybe it's because of familiarity, but \"The Beekeeper\" wasn't entirely original either, so I'm okay with a generic Statham movie. This narrative was too much for me, though.Finally, it's possible that \"The Beekeeper\" set my expectations, but regardless, this film was way too serious for its good. Again, it revolves around human trafficking, and they would take it seriously, I get it. It has many moments that try to be comedic as if to indicate that it'd balance the subject matter with the Jason Statham entertainment people like myself expected, not just exclusive to that prior Statham/Ayer offering. Ironically, one of my issues with \"The Beekeeper\" is the seriousness present, but it mixed the topics of scamming elders with exhilarating action better than this follow-up.Overall, \"A Working Man\" was Taken Lite meets Rambo Raw, not the unofficial sequel to \"The Beekeeper\" I hoped it'd be. Then again, they announced that sequel weeks earlier, and I'm incredibly excited to see what they do. As much as I can't forgive the issues, I understand you may be able to. If The Expendables and Rambo are your thing, even their weaker installments, you'll enjoy your time here.Technically, the screenplay holds it back, but the acting, directing, and cinematography make the technical score a 6/10.For the enjoyment score, there's potential for a 7/10 experience if you can ignore the issues I discussed in this review. Otherwise, a 5/10 enjoyment score will more or less be the result. It was a disappointing day at the office, but the action may justify going to the theaters!",

This film feels like an 80s movie wrapped in modern technology, with that campy, macho dive into taking care of business, just not as blaring trumpets. Statham's acting is much like most of his movies: simple and to the point as his rugged character tackles the odds of some horrible group. The film brings fantastic special effects and sound editing to the fray to make the theaters light up with explosions and shake from their thunderous sound. As the extras go down, the makeup effects kick in for injury and finishes, an excellent finish to give you that video game finesse. Where the movie also manages to succeed is the comedy, fun, dynamic lines with nice delivery that make for some needed relief from the in-your-face action. Surprisingly, there are some okay character development moments, with Statham's Levon giving us some insight into his past having a little more bite than most of our stars do, and connections with various characters that may prove useful in future sequels. We even get a bit of insight into other characters, including the abductee and her captors who have a little more to their profiles than the usual goons this genre is filled with. It helps to give this movie a bit more investment, which is something I appreciate.However, Stallone and his team still have to work out the full balance to perfect their storytelling for viewers like me. A Working Man suffers from combatting story arcs that all work in the same direction but don't have the same balance or facilitated handoff as a movie should have. There are all these hints of deeper character involvement, but they sort of fall to the wayside for many, and those that continue to feel uneven and inconsistent with what they were building. In addition, several moments feel forced and shoved in that seem to be more unnecessary bloat than anything else, especially trying to set up a sequel that already had plenty of setups. This excessive building sort of gets sloppy, the pace becoming too quick, and the baddies coming off as comedic rather than deadly, leading to that excitement factor petering out before it got to full strength. For me, this turned into a predictable plot, one filled with too many conveniences and disbelief that I didn't expect. They had some good gimmicks, but they come off as more comedic and half-hearted, with inconsistent gestures that needed more time, setup, and explanation than the way they did this character. Maybe it was an attempt at comedy again, or maybe it was just time constraints, but the movie's inconsistency didn't add up for me and needed a little more organization to be included for the time commitment.The VERDICT:\nI had fun with this film, and I feel that it was a great adventure back into the action genre without too much thought involved. It's simply fun for an action series loaded with jokes, guns, and that stalwart hero to face the odds no matter the cost. Great effects, good coordination, and that fast pace all add up to the entertainment aspect, alongside a better story component that works with many parties to give some depth to an otherwise simplistic plot. Yet, the movie tries to do a lot of setups for a potential universe, and it leads to some unequal attention and quality that hurt the movie. Combatting plotlines that require convenience throws off the momentum, and the build-up just feels dragged out and could have been substituted for some more intense action scenes. I would have preferred even more dives into Levon or the other's tales, if possible, bored that these characters felt too inconsistent despite the promises. Sure, the little insights work, but there could have been so much more with better organization. Maybe the sequel will have more time to play with all of this and extend Levon's character if it gets greenlit. Is it a theater-worthy movie? Yes, I think it is for all the fun and effects.My scores for A Working Man are:\nAction/Thriller: 7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

He wasn't hurt much in the movie even if he infiltrated and attacked the mafia. He was hit a few times and pushed a few times, but wasn't hurt otherwise. He, himself, killed a whole lot of people in the mafia with the only repercussions being on a guy he doesn't even like. It would have been nice to have some doubts, some flaws to make the character believable. I would have loved to have more scenes that shows his torture techniques too, thus showing that he couldn't be messed with.Story: the story was a mess, bouncing from place to place without grounding the spectator with recurring places. We went from a construction site to a bar, to a forest, to a mafia hangout, to a rich house, to a school, to an apartment to... it could have worked with just a bit less places to go. It would have gave some time to show the bonds between the characters in the beginning. The action was pretty boring, but I liked the torture methods in the first part of the movie. I just wish that they'd get almost rid of the action and concentrate more on what he had learned in the marine.Secondary characters: the other characters in the story were bland at best and bad at most. The spectators don't have enough screen time to bond with the main character and it removes any tension to find the kidnapped girl, Jenny (who was only \"feisty and religious\") completely lost. I wish they would have taken more time to establish Jenny and their parents for more than few minutes to establish a better suspense.Villains: the villains were overall not threatening. They were from the Russian mafia, but they were incompetent to be killed by one single guy and never actually hurting the main character, so it was clear that they would loose in the end. Even the kidnapping of a girl proved to be too hard for them as she was able to hurt a client and escape. They were also so many villains that it was impossible to establish something truly threatening.Conclusion: The story was boring and the characters were underwhelming and boring too. It was an action movie where the action scenes weren't really interesting. The main character looked invincible and I wish he had more flaws. The only thing that was nice was the torture sequences, which I thought was the only thing that stuck out from a really generic action movie.",

Then he sets the gun on the table with all his finger prints on it and does some dumb ritual prayer and leaves it at the crime scene....There is a good premise here, I mean it's why people loved the first Taken movie. It just lacks coherence mostly, it feels like old rambo writing trying to be new but doesn't really get there. I haven't seen any of The Expendables movies because I kinda expected them to be like this with a unrealistic story base and an emphasis on everyone being too cool for school. I was just looking to kill 2hrs though and thought it could be good, I was mistaken, I mean it was this or Minecraft movie. *shrugs*",

        "title": "Jason Statham provides his reliable action prowess to Ayer's over stylized direction by way Stallone's hamfisted screenplay",
        "content": "Former Royal Marine Commando Levon Cade (Jason Statham) is now living in Chicago, Illinois working construction as he tries to be a good father to his daughter Meredith \"Merry\" (Isla Gie) who is in the primary custody of Levon's father-in-law Dr. Jordan Roth (Richard Heap) who holds Levon a grudge after the suicide of his daughter and Levon's wife during his time on deployment. When Jenny Garcia (Arianna Rivas), the daughter of Levon's boss and friend Joe (Michael Pena) is abducted while celebrating with friends, Joe enlists Levon's help in tracking her down sending Levon on a journey into the criminal underworld and on a collision course with the Russian mob outfit known as the Bratva.A Working Man reteams Jason Statham and director/co-writer David Ayer after the two worked together on the 2024 sleeper hit The Beekeeper. Adapted from the 2014 novel Levon's Trade written by comic writer Chuck Dixon (sort of like a cut rate Frank Miller with a similar downward career trajectory), the rights to the book were acquired by credited co-writer Sylvester Stallone's Balboa Productions with the initial plan to adapt the book and character to television. In 2023, the project was retooled as a feature film with Statham set to star and the project was acquired by Amazon MGM Studios two weeks after The Beekeeper opened to surprise critical and financial success. While A Working Man follows the well-trodden ground of vigilante trash pictures of the 80s, A Working Man mostly provides the over the top goofiness of The Exterminator or Death Wish 3 more than the ugliness of Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects or Death Wish II.As many have noted, Statham's archetypal action hero roles don't have much differentiation mainly falling into the men of few words who follow a strict moral code until pushed to action (such as Wrath of Man, Beekeeper, Mechanic, etc.). On occasion you'll see Statham touch into a more sardonic wiseass side of his personality with certain Guy Ritchie roles or the Crank films, but has mostly embraced his typecasting as a steady stream of work and certainly delivers the goods when it comes to action. When it comes to the direction, the film is less in line with David Ayer's End of Watch or Fury and more in line with the garish stabilization of Suicide Squad or Beekeeper. Combined with a script co-written by Sylvester Stallone that's less Rocky and more the overly blunt Cobra or Homefront and when you couple Stallone's written lack of nuance with Ayer's directorial lack of nuance and mined from a source who has never known nuance you get some similar action excess that falls well within what was given to us with last year's Beekeeper. I will say while the style is as over the top as Beekeeper, the action premise is very standard vigilante fare which actually does work to its favor by having more varied and gritty action sequences where Statham's character doesn't have the nigh invincibility of his Beekeeper character meaning there's slightly more tension to the action sequences.A Working Man delivers exactly what you'd expect given the star and production team. With absolutely ridiculous action excess delivered with complete seriousness, it makes a welcome addition to other required viewings of the vigilante trash genre like The Exterminator or Death Wish 3.",

The script could have been written better by a 12 year old autistic child in his bedroom. I love films in general but sadly the end couldn't come quickly enough. Unlike the Beekeeper which I could watch weekly, I won't be watching l A Working Man when it comes to TV.

What I got instead was a painfully slow, clich√©-ridden mess that felt more like a parody than an actual film.The plot tries to follow a blue-collar hero who's \"forced\" into a life of violence after his job gets outsourced-sounds promising, right? Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there. The script is filled with laughably bad one-liners and motivational speeches that sound like they were lifted from a fortune cookie.The action scenes are poorly choreographed, with the main character miraculously surviving gunfights and explosions that would wipe out an army. And let's not even talk about the villain, who is so cartoonishly evil that he might as well have twirled a mustache and tied someone to train tracks.To top it off, the pacing is a disaster. Long, boring monologues are awkwardly wedged between chase scenes that feel like they were edited by someone who just discovered slow motion.If you're looking for a movie to mock with friends, A Working Man might be worth a watch. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and skip this one. Your time is better spent doing literally anything else.---Want me to make it more sarcastic or brutal?",

The comedic attempts are hit or miss. I laughed at some but others fell flat. And my investment/engagement was... medium?I can't fully explain why it didn't work better. Maybe it's because none of the aspects excel. Maybe it's because the entire cast outside of the lead is weak (most of them are TV actors, not movie actors).I just didn't feel that spark. I definitely didn't mind watching it. But it's not something memorable that I see myself revisiting.Hopefully 2025 can turn itself around because this is the worst start to the year I can remember.P.

There were several things to enjoy about this movie - the premise was interesting and it was comedic to see some of the situations he got himself into during his rescue mission. While I didn't hate this film, I wasn't super in love with it, which surprised me because the trailer made it look pretty fun. Part of the problem is, I think, the casting of Jack Quaid - who seems to play the same type of character in most of his roles - and the writing of the love interest could have probably been improved in ways to make her character a bit more likable. An unnecessary racially divisive line snuck in at the end was nonsensical too. But as a whole, I've seen worse movies, so I don't consider this a waste of my time.

The characters were likeable, they had growth, the plot was well paced and solid, the action was exciting and the gore grotesque, (but in the best way possible). Not to mention that it was surprisingly clean for a rated R movie. Not to say it didn't earn the rating, but the plot wasn't muddled with unnecessary, drawn out sex scenes and the swearing was used (somewhat) sparingly. I go to these kinds of movie for the guts and gore so I was just delighted with how this movie turned out. I will definitely be going back to the theatre to see this again!!!Edit: I saw this at an early showing on 3-8-25.",

        "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. In decades past, we wouldn't have been surprised in the least to see a movie starring Jack Nicholson and Dennis Quaid. In fact, in 1973 Jack co-starred with Dennis' brother Randy in one of my favorite films, THE LAST DETAIL. Well, here we are more than fifty years later, and Dennis' (and Meg Ryan's) son Jack Quaid is co-starring with Jack's son Ray Nicholson in what is sure to be one of this year's most outlandish action-comedies. The screenplay is by Lars Jacobson and the film is co-directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, who also collaborated on BODY (2015).REM's \"Everybody Hurts\" plays over the opening credits and sequence which provide hints to the measures Nathan Caine (Jack Quaid, COMPANION, 2025) has taken around his house. With tennis balls shielding sharp corners and a stop to prevent scalding water in the shower, Nathan appears to be quite accident-prone. We learn he's a good-guy Assistant Manager at a local San Diego bank, and profiles as nebbish in his looks and skittish mannerisms ... especially around new bank teller Sherry (Amber Midthunder, THE ICE ROAD, 2021). Sensing his awkwardness and attraction, Sherry takes charge and asks Nathan to lunch. A bite of cherry pie leads Nathan to disclose his rare genetic disorder - he simply cannot feel pain (thus explaining the earlier tennis balls).One personal disclosure leads to another, which leads to an art gallery, which leads to romantic intimacy and what easily could spin off into a familiar quirky rom-com with these two. Instead, while Nathan is riding an emotional high, three men dressed as Santa Claus violently rob the bank on Christmas Eve and take Nathan's new squeeze Sherry as hostage. This sends our wimpy superhero Nathan (nicknamed Novocaine by junior high bullies) on a rescue mission. His previous fighting experience has been limited to online video game sessions with Roscoe (Jacob Batalon, Ned from Marvel movies), although the two have never actually met.The fight sequences are quite violent and absurdly comical in how they take advantage of Nathan's blend of physical disorder, nice guy tendencies, and commitment to rescuing his first love. Creativity is at maximum volume as Nathan takes on a red-hot frying pan and boiling oil in a restaurant kitchen skirmish, replete with bodily poundings that would leave anyone else shattered. Things really pick up in a wickedly booby-trapped house that sets up a HOME ALONE joke. Mostly, however, the body horror serves as punchline after punchline ... some surely to tweak even the most squeamish movie goers.Ray Nicholson (I LOVE YOU FOREVER, 2024) provides a jolt of adrenaline and psychotic violent behavior to ensure no one watching still believes this is a rom-com in the making. His Simon thrives not so much on the money from the robberies as the power and control he displays and the torture he doles out. The finale battles between Simon and Nathan are extreme and creatively unique. While the entertainment value is present, there are still some minor issues with the story and proceedings. The detectives on the case are played by Betty Gabriel (GET OUT, 2017) and Matt Walsh (\"Veep\"). These two talented actors are given very little to do and it's a shame their roles weren't beefed up a bit. Additionally, there is a key twist that will surprise almost no one. Is it even a twist if they tell you it's coming?The action scenes are purposefully absurd, and although some bits are over-the-top, others are pure comedy-action brilliance. Jack Quaid is fitting right in to his lead character roles, and Ray Nicholson is mastering the wild-eyed psycho dude. Amber Midthunder shows yet again how immensely talented she is, and it's likely her future roles will take advantage of what she brings on screen. My personal biggest hope is that the filmmakers avoid a sequel ... one which would likely leave us viewers disappointingly numb (had to work in one pun).Opens in theaters on March 14, 2025.",

        "content": "I expected a pretty standard crime thriller like something straightforward, maybe even predictable. But by the end, this film has more going on beneath the surface. It blends dark humor, unexpected twist, and clever action in a way that makes it stand out.The story centers on Nathan Caine, a quiet, introverted assistant bank manager living in San Diego. Nathan has a rare condition called congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), meaning he physically can't feel pain. It's an unusual trait that the movie uses to great effect. Instead of making him invincible, it shows how Nathan has to outthink his enemies and use his condition smartly when things go sideways.At first, his life seems pretty routine, awkward social interactions, a hesitant romance with a coworker, and dealing with people from his childhood. But the film doesn't stay quiet for long. A group of robbers dressed in Santa suits shows up and kicks off a series of events that turn Nathan's world upside down. What I appreciated is that the plot doesn't just unfold in a straight line. It's got some sharp turns and reveals that kept me guessing without feeling forced.One thing that surprised me was how much comedy is sprinkled throughout. Despite the dark, tense situations, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. There are moments of awkward humor, dry wit, and even a few absurd situations that had me smile. It adds some levity and keeps the pacing fresh, especially in the first half.Visually, Novocaine is solid. The cinematography has a cool, slightly moody vibe without being too over-stylized, and the sound design does a great job enhancing both the tension and the action. You really feel the weight of certain moments, whether it's a quiet stare-down or a burst of violence.That said, not everything hits perfectly. There's a chase scene that, while important to the plot, feels a little sluggish at times. Some shots lack the energy you'd expect from a high-stakes pursuit, it almost feels like it loses momentum when it should be cranking up. It doesn't ruin the movie by any means, but it stood out as one of the weaker parts.Still, where Novocaine really shines is in its characters and clever action sequences. The film doesn't rely on massive explosions. Instead, it's more about strategy, survival, and seeing how someone like Nathan, who isn't a traditional action hero, handles increasingly dangerous situations.By the end Novocaine proves itself to be more than just a simple action/thriller. It's sharp, funny, and keeps you on your toes, even if it has slower spots. If you're into thrillers that mix brains with a bit of dark comedy and unique lead characters, this one's worth a watch.",

All sharp edges in his home are padded, he avoids solid food for fear of biting his tongue in half, and he sets an alarm on his watch to remind him to go to the bathroom, because his bladder might burst if he forgets.As a result, he lives a rather lonely life, playing video games with a friend he's never met face to face.

        "content": "If Novocaine wasn't so extremely violent and incredibly bloody, I would call it 'lighthearted': it's frivolous, humorous, a touch romantic and often ridiculous. And it's also quite a lot of fun.Jack Quaid stars as assistant bank manager Nathan 'Novocaine' Caine, who, thanks to a rare genetic disorder, is unable to feel physical pain. When armed criminals rob the bank, taking Nate's new girlfriend Sherry (Amber Midthunder) hostage, he attempts to track down the gang and rescue the girl.The film's gimmick - that mild-mannered Nathan can be shot, burnt, beaten and broken and not feel the effect - makes for a very entertaining action film, even if, truth be told, the humour doesn't always land. One might expect the novelty to quickly wear off, but writer Lars Jacobson manages to keep it from becoming stale, finding plenty of new and creative ways to inflict damage on his central character.If you've caught the trailer, which revealed far too much, the impact of certain scenes will probably be diminished, but there is at least one major twist, which they thankfully didn't give away in the previews, that adds an extra level of interest to the story.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for opening with Everybody Hurts by R.

        "content": "It genuinely pains me when I have to say that a movie has absolutely nothing going for it, but, in the case of this celluloid trainwreck, I can come up with no other way to describe it. This overlong, frequently implausible, gratuitously violent, truly stupid offering from directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen is one of the worst excuses for a film that I have ever seen, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. The film tells the story of Nick Caine (a.k.a. \"Novocaine\") (Jack Quaid), a 30-something credit union assistant manager who suffers from a rare genetic disorder that shields him from experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort when injured, even though the physical damage to his body is real enough. He's something of a sheltered, geeky milquetoast, having lived much of his life isolated from many of its everyday experiences as a means to protect him from potential undue harm. So it's highly inconceivable that he somehow knows how to skillfully handle himself when caught up in a robbery of his workplace and his subsequent one-man amateur pursuit of the bad guys when they escape with a hostage, one of the facility's tellers (Amber Midthunder), who also happens to be his new girlfriend. However, as this scenario plays out, the narrative grows progressively more preposterous with every passing frame, much of it designed to show how many times he can be shot, beat up and brutally hacked apart without ever feeling anything and yet still be able to keep going with his mission. Because of this, the sequence of events becomes increasingly repetitive, ever-more farfetched and just plain dumb, with ridiculous, over-the-top plot developments that fail to engage and frequently feature incongruous and unoriginal dialogue. But, to add real insult to injury, this release bills itself as a comedy but is virtually devoid of humor except a smattering of one-liners that mostly fall flat. This offering is so ineptly executed that it makes productions like \"Joker 2\" and the \"John Wick\" movies look like masterpieces by comparison. Indeed, if you've watched the trailer for this one, you've seen all you really need to see. \"Novocaine\" is a sorry excuse for contemporary filmmaking and a prime example of everything that's wrong with the domestic motion picture industry these days, a cinematic cautionary tale for film school students on how not to make a movie. By all means, skip this one, even when it becomes available for streaming.",

        "content": "The premise and trailer propelled this action-comedy to being my sixth most anticipated film of the year. As for whether it lived up to my high expectations having seen it, it did, although one issue is somewhat painful to overlook. That was an intentional pun, but it's not as dramatic as that pun would have you believe.Let's start with Jack Quaid's exceptional performance. He makes Nathan Caine an investing and often funny protagonist as he risks his life to save his dream girl - also, he can't feel pain. That's important, too. Refreshingly, Caine doesn't have a past like a John Wick, a Hutch Mansell, or a Bryan Mills. He's legitimately an ordinary guy who unlocks beast mode like he had previous experience. The rest of the cast did solid work, although Jacob Batalon and Amber Midthunder - despite one decision - were the other standouts alongside Quaid.Lars Jacobson's screenplay increases the fun on display and contains an unexpected amount of heart. \"Novocaine\" isn't a straightforward action-comedy as it doubles as a romantic comedy, which I wasn't expecting. First, \"Companion,\" then \"Heart Eyes,\" and now this film provides the perfect case of 2025 bringing back the romantic comedy, albeit while being another genre first. Furthermore, Jacobson's work makes Caine incredibly relatable, and his simple backstory helps him be that.Dan Berk and Robert Olsen's direction was flashy and fun. Many moments showed creativity in camerawork and editing - added credit goes to cinematographer Jacques Jouffett and editor Christian Wagner - while Berk and Olsen's work enhanced the narrative and script.The action was an action fan's delight. While not as focused as expected, the film creatively utilizes Caine's incapacity to sense pain to the action's advantage.Finally, the 1 hour and 50 minute runtime was rarely wasteful, with two exceptions. I felt the movie perfectly balances comedy, action, drama, and romance to create an experience that always engages.Now, let's get into my mixed feelings on some aspects. I won't spoil anything because I still feel it's worth seeing. Nonetheless, I'm all about being honest in my reviews.First, there are two to three cop scenes that threaten the film's momentum, but thankfully, they're not as long as I thought they'd be once they began. Using \"The Beekeeper\" and \"Knox Goes Away\" as comparisons, the scenes that focused on the people investigating Adam Clay and John Knox dragged on. They don't as much in here.Now, I'll get into the real thing that bothered me while being vague at the same time. While I enjoyed Midthunder's Sherry, a reveal about forty minutes in bothered me. It made sense in the end, but until then, I was baffled that they decided to do that. I expected a direct approach to her character, but it wasn't, yet they somehow made it work. Making another comparison, but one that makes less sense, \"Blink Twice\" was a film that started confusingly. I didn't know how to feel about Frida and Jess, and the film wasn't entirely compelling when it began. As the movie continues, especially with that final revelation, it all comes together and makes up for its issues. That was the sensation I got with Sherry, although it wasn't as much of a payoff as \"Blink Twice.\" It was more or less a \"Thank God!\" moment that the movie's primary issue fixed itself in the end rather than, \"Oh, that's what the movie was leading to.\"Overall, \"Novocaine\" might have fallen a wee bit short of expectations, but it was damn fun regardless! Jack Quaid proves he's a leading man, and the entire film proves that you don't need to be part of a franchise to make an entertaining action-comedy.Technically, screenplay issues aside, the acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and editing make for a 9/10 technical score.For the enjoyment score, I loved many things about \"Novocaine,\" although that reveal dared to weigh down the experience. Otherwise, it's not a stretch to say we need more movies like this from major studios. It doesn't have to be all about IP, and it's films like this that are why. Although the enjoyment score should realistically be a 9, the movie knows what it is and runs with it - and Jack Quaid is so fantastic that I forgive the flaw. Therefore, the enjoyment score is a 10/10. It's not the best movie of the year thus far, as \"Companion\" remains my favorite, but it's a thrilling time!It's the end of the review, but I want to focus on \"Companion.\" Coincidentally, Quaid's other vehicle from January was my eighth most anticipated film of the year. I'm shocked that I can't call \"Mickey 17\" better than that. I can't stress enough how incredible that film was. It's a thriller that quadruples as a horror, a dark comedy, and, as I mentioned earlier, a romcom. Quaid was better here in \"Novocaine,\" but he was excellent as Josh, and Sophie Thatcher gave an astounding performance as Iris. I'd recommend seeing both \"Companion\" and \"Novocaine.\" People like me who aren't Jack Quaid fans are realizing that this man's a star on the rise that's worth paying attention to. I'm interested and even excited to see what he does next if Josh and Nathan Caine are any indications of his undeniable talents.",

It's one of those films that has a brilliant concept, a killer lead performance, and moments of sheer creativity... but somehow still leaves you wanting more.Let's start with the best part: Jack Quaid. As Nathan Caine, he's absolutely awesome. Quaid brings this perfect mix of vulnerability, awkwardness, and unexpected badassery. His character feels like a blend of his role in The Boys and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kick-Ass but with his own unique twist. There's a familiar Hughie Campbell energy to Nathan, but Quaid makes sure you know this is a different guy. He's funny, relatable, and totally convincing as a man who can't feel pain. Honestly, his performance alone keeps the movie afloat.But here's the problem, the film never fully capitalizes on its amazing premise. Nathan's inability to feel physical pain is a fascinating concept, and while there are moments where the movie gets creative with it, those moments are too few and far between. When it does show the bizarre and dangerous things he can do because of this \"power,\" it's awesome but it leaves you wondering why they didn't push it even further. This could've been Crank levels of chaos, or John Wick levels of adrenaline. Instead, the film feels sluggish. Not exactly boring, but lazy. It's got energy, but it never quite reaches the edge-of-your-seat intensity it's aiming for. But keep in mind that the gore is creative and satisfying nevertheless.The story itself is simple. Maybe too simple. Nathan Caine is an everyday nobody who suddenly has to save his girlfriend, and while we appreciate how grounded and relatable his character is, the stakes feel pretty low. He only fights about half a dozen bad guys, so if you're expecting an all-out, one-man-army situation like John Wick or Nobody, you'll be disappointed. That said, the film does manage to balance its more grounded approach with some absolutely brutal, bloody fight scenes. It's gory, it's messy, and it's definitely entertaining but again, it could've gone even harder. The creativity is there, but they just don't go all-in.Another issue? A major twist gets revealed way too early. And it's frustrating because you can literally see the perfect moment near the end where they could've dropped that bombshell for maximum impact. Instead, the early reveal drains some of the tension and leaves you waiting for the movie to catch up to what you already know.As for the humor, it's hit or miss. When the comedy plays off Nathan's inability to feel pain, it's gold. We laughed out loud more than a few times thanks to Quaid's impeccable delivery and priceless expressions. But when the jokes veer away from that, they often fall flat, sometimes even veering into cringe territory.Verdict: Novocaine (2025) is a mixed bag. It's a just-enough entertaining but flawed action-comedy with flashes of brilliance. Jack Quaid's performance is worth the price of admission alone. However, the film never quite reaches its full potential. It's a movie with a killer concept that only half delivers. Entertaining? Sure. It still delivers enough bloody fun and heart to keep you hooked. But it leaves you wishing for what could've been.",

        "content": "LIKES:\nFast Pace\nEngaging Sound/Music\nGreat Well-Timed Lines\nRidiculously Funny\nCreative Fights/Finishes\nGood Acting For This Movie\nA Lot Of Fun References\nCinematography Works\nSummary:\nThe poster of Novocaine tells it as it is: The movie is fast, ridiculous, and straight to the point. It's a fast ride into this odd rescue operation that has a quick intro to set things up before diving into the big event. From there, the movie is like a video game where stages are intense bouts of comedic brawling that have just a few interludes to reset and progress the story. It's got enough logic to make all the theatrics work and the ridiculous idea plausible in this world of extravagant heroism. The fights are creative, a blend of comedy and craziness that works well to keep the audience laughing and promising some of the action alongside it. It's bloody, raw, and vicious, but it's wonderful on so many levels in how diverse they kept things in these fights. A wild collection of sound editing and a fantastic soundtrack accompany the movie and give it that flair that rolls with the craziness. The movie manages to incorporate a lot of references into the movie in the form of props, callouts, quotes, and mimicry that were very welcome, utilized to a grand extent to keep the entertainment coming. Many of these lines were so well-timed that I burst out laughing from how amazing the jab was. The acting helps to bring all of this to life, with Quaid continuing to take his awkward style and twist it comedically in different ways. A stark contrast to his Companions character, I loved the character he got to make and how well he unleashed that quirkiness. Wrap it all up with great camera work to keep the action in the scene, but also find unique angles to get the moment in.DISLIKES:\nToo Stupid At Times\nSuspense of Disbelief Is Sometimes A Bit Much\nMore Character Balance\nAction Is Reasonable But Bland\nIt Could Have Been A Bit Deeper/Twist Executed Later\nWatch the Language\nHard-to-Watch Scenes\nSummary:\nThe movie is very stupid, an aggressive twitch that will not be for everyone and may not be noted in the trailers. For one thing, the movie requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. The condition may be plausible, but the degree of injuries he faces approach, if not surpass, John Wick levels of pain. To then have the logic deficit and timing inconsistencies adds the cherries on top to this silliness sundae, which those who must have believability need to avoid. Past that, the movie still needs a bit more balance in some of the characters, a bit more balance for the three groups to help flesh out a little more story, a bit more depth in the mystery, a bit more suspense, and a bit later implementation of the twist to bring that knockout punch. The action is reasonable in this film for the comedic component, a realistic execution of this situation, but one that needed a tad more action to give you the excitement the trailers promised. Fortunately, the movie accomplishes the entertainment value enough to offset this and is more than enough to have you laughing. As for the other limitations, the language is a bit harsh and lazy in execution to the point that it gets annoying and will irritate those with low sensitivity to cursing language. In addition, my friends who struggle to watch bouts of torture, suffering, and extreme cruelty to the human body are going to need to divert from this film as well. The blood alone could be sickening, but the movie only gets worse in terms of suffering and gore as it continues, and the camera captures every ounce of detail in big-screen glory. Please make sure to exercise caution.The VERDICT:\nNovocaine is nuts, fun, and just plain popcorn-munching flick that I've needed for a while. It's a ludicrous concept that requires great blindness to reality, yet it keeps itself grounded to not get too out there to be obnoxious. A well-cast crew helps bring the comedy and characters to life, nailing the dialog with exceptional finesse, awesome inflections, and the right amount of emotion for every moment. The action is not as composed as John Wick, but for the story and comedy, it works to be entertaining and keep the mood elevated and supportive of the fast pace. Yet, the movie is very hard to watch for sensitive viewers, earning its R rating with pride at the violence it brings to the screen. Novocaine is a blood sport that tries to tone it down with silliness but still has plenty of skin-crawling moments when the torture is applied or a particular blow is illustrated so graphically. Throw in that the logic of the movie is going to be less appeasable to those with a sensitivity to such a plot. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Yeah, for all the visual effects and fun, it works for most people just looking for a good time, while others can choose to hold out for the theater if you are looking for something with more layers and suspense.My scores are:\nAction/Comedy/Thriller: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",

You would think it would get old pretty quick, but they did a great job of keeping it fresh throughout. As for the plot, it's pretty predictable especially towards the end. But overall I think this is just another slightly above average action comedy (which feels like 90% of the movies now a days).The acting was fairly good throughout. Jack Quaid did a great job, but everyone else seemed a bit lackluster. Maybe that was just due to the genre of the movie, as I feel that every action comedy, doesn't really require amazing acting performances all the time. I'm sure it was fun to film!",

        "content": "Novocaine sets up a premise that screams superhero origin-a man who can't feel pain, forced into high-stakes danger-but instead of embracing that, it buries itself in crime drama, making the story feel misplaced.The film spends too much time on Nathan's struggles-his job, his romance, his past-dragging out emotional beats that could have been covered more efficiently. When the action finally kicks in, the pacing is inconsistent, bouncing between slow, dramatic moments and bursts of violence that feel disconnected.The biggest issue is that the movie seems afraid to lean into what it naturally should be. Instead of fully embracing its superhero-like concept, it runs away from it, landing in a genre that doesn't fit. The gruesome action and body condition setup had the potential for an intense action-thriller or even a dark comedy, but the film keeps pulling itself into a slow-burning crime drama. The villain feels like he belongs in a psychological thriller rather than a fast-paced action film, adding to the genre confusion.At its core, Novocaine isn't a bad idea-it's just a story trapped in the wrong genre. If it had embraced its superhero-like premise, it could have been something unique. Instead, it seems to deliberately avoid that direction, holding itself back from what it was meant to be.",

The action, when it happens, didn't engage and felt somewhat sluggish and gimmicky.. but the movie goes places (it's quite gruesome)! Yet the script felt underwritten, and the intention is not to take it seriously (which doesn't help). The comedy bit didn't land either.

        "content": "Jack Quaid has proven himself one of the most promising actors of his generation. He's also a real film geek, which becomes evident when you see him on Red Letter Media. The narrative premise here is actually incredibly strong.Awkward loser bank employee has a budding romance with a coworker, only for the bank to be robbed the next day and having to save the girl. But not all is as it seems.The first 30 minutes of the movie had me sold. The romance is well written and thought out. Yes, it comes a bit too convenient, but it makes narrative sense later on.The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, and we're instantly rooting for them.The bank robbery itself is shocking in its brutality. The actor playing the lead villain looks like a slimmer Bam Margera and imbues his villain with unpredictability and sadism.Like the romance, it's handled seriously. But once we get to our hero's first action scene, things go off the rails. He can't feel pain, so he shrugs off hits and stabs that would kill or cripple a person.This is when the suspension of disbelief gets strained. Even more so, they insert joke lines in a life and death fight scene between an untrained geeky bank employee and an ex military killer.From thereon out, the action scenes only become increasingly more ridiculous, complete with annoying loud pop / rock music and even worse, uninteresting clich√© sidekicks.But the worst flaw is the twist. I don't want to spoil the twist, and initially it's fantastic. You never see it coming, and it's heartbreaking.Unfortunately, the character revealed to be a villain has a completely unpredictable turn towards becoming a hero, complete with action scenes and dumb one liners.The movie only has 3 villains, and the main villain resurrects from the dead 4 times for a total of 5 fight scenes which take up the entire last 20+ minutes of the movie, while involving more and more of the uninteresting side characters (complete with an obligatory righteous diverse policewoman and the annoying chubby sidekick from the new spiderman movies in exactly the same role).It further dilutes our hero's journey, but nothing harms the narrative like the redemption arc for that one particular character. A better script would have had the courage to keep this character a villain, because what this character did was unforgiveable and deserving of a great movie death (instead of having the main villain resurrect ad nauseum).By the end of the film I felt annoyed. Annoyed by the cowardly script, annoyed by the side characters, annoyed by the endless 20 min fight against the villain, annoyed by the stupid jokes, repetitive self injuries and tired of the overbearing music.My score would be: First half of the movie (up until the twist) 9/10Second half of the movie (post twist) 2/10.Evens out to 5/10. What a waste of talent. Maybe a fanedit can fix this mess. I'm sure the movie would be better with about 25-30 minutes cut from the second half.",

        "content": "Novocaine is a new action film directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, directors of Villains and Body.Nate (Jack Quaid) suffers from the autosomal recessive disorder CIPA, which, among other things, prevents him from feeling physical pain. When Sherry (Amber Midthunder), the girl he's dating, is kidnapped during a bank robbery, he must do everything he can to save her. His inability to feel physical pain can actually help him during this mission.Because the main character can't feel pain, the film risks lacking real tension. However, the protagonist still faces the risk of being seriously injured or losing something like a finger during his struggle with criminals. Additionally, others he cares about are at risk, and these characters can feel pain.Fortunately, they manage to balance the film with comedic moments and entertaining action scenes. These action sequences also lean toward the brutal and bloody side. However, the film does run a bit too long and might have too many extra characters. If it had been trimmed down to about an hour and a half, the film could have had a better pace and been more enjoyable.Jack Quaid delivers well as someone who, despite not feeling pain, prefers to play it safe to avoid accidentally or unknowingly getting hurt. Nevertheless, he has to face this danger to save his girlfriend. Amber Midthunder plays her role well as his girlfriend, who tries to keep him safe but occasionally pushes the limits. Together, they come across convincingly as a couple. Ray Nicholson also plays a fitting role as one of the criminals in the film.",

The main lead is very likable and has great comedic timing. The side characters are mostly boring, while the love interest starts off interesting but falls apart once the twist is revealed too early and puts her in one of two camps for most women in action movies (either helpless damsel or lying jezebel who can't be too evil to be the villain, but isn't pure enough to be celebrated, helping a little to give the less qualified male hero enough time to stop the villain so he can get his self-actualization trophy wife). Which makes the movie feel like a cheap beta male power fantasy with a romance that starts charming but spreads thin and goes nowhere after the twist fizzles out the character investment. But luckily the movie's main appeal is its insane premise, which it still delivers in handfuls of plenty.",

Jack plays a man that can not feel any physical pain. He has to be careful, even eating solid food because he might bite his tongue by mistake and not even know it. Jack is the assistant manager at a bank and works with Amber, a teller. He doesn't go out much, mainly playing online video games with his friend, Jacob. Amber takes an interest in Jack and they go on a couple of dates, just getting to know each other and she brings Jack out of his comfort zone-he thinks she might be his soul mate. When Ray and his companions decide to rob the bank, they take Amber hostage during their escape and Jack decides that he is the only one to save her-most of the cops were shot or incapacitated during the escape and the arriving cops think Jack may be in on the robbery. As Jack tracks down Ray & company, there are lots of bloody-and comical-fights, since Jack can not feel any pain in his injuries. If you are squeamish about blood, you might want to avoid this one because it is bloody-arrow piercing his body, burns, broken bones sticking through his skin, knife stabbing...\nIt's rated R for bloody violence, grisly images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes.I really liked this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",

It could've been fun, but Quaid's face-like an angry little Chinese dog-ruins it. He's a loser with a genetic quirk, inexplicably paired with a weirdly hot chick who deserves better than his whiny scowl. The action's decent-blood, fryer gags, some chaos-but his mug drags every scene down like a wet sock.Midthunder's a spark, all grit and odd allure, but the script's too flimsy to let her shine, or maybe she's just a bad actress, I don't know. The comedy flops more than it lands, and the romance feels like a bad Tinder swipe. It's watchable if you're burnt out and just need noise-toss it on mute and chat over it-but don't expect much. A 1, barely, for her and the gore. Quaid's dog-face energy kills any hope of more.",

I feel like Jacob Battalon is let down by the roles he's cast in. He is only in this to do an edgier version his Spider-Man character. Also I liked seeing Matt Walsh. Always a funny guy.The thing is though, the script and the set-up lets this movie down. You cannot have the main character go from the most scared white dude in history who won't even swallow solid food to maniac smashing his fists into glass to attack an Australian neo-Nazi in the course of a day. The character progression isn't there and the leaps they use to get there are nonsensical.Maybe if he was forced into those situations and had to do that to survive, but he's actively putting himself in these positions to save a girl he had one date with. I don't mind at the end of the day, because the action is insane, but let's be real. Also nobody who started tattooing themself as a kid using a mirror and covering their whole body would do that good a job. Really weird choice.Oh, and the main thing that let me down was the main villain. For this kind of movie you need an iconic star-turn performance to anchor the insanity and this guy couldn't do that. He's not a great actor and I rolled my eyes whenever he was on screen. Otherwise I really enjoyed it. Also I got to see it two weeks early, which was nice.",

Went in expecting some run-of-the-mill action, but holy jumpin', this thing hits harder than a blue-liner in the playoffs.So, we got Jack Quaid as Nathan Caine, a guy who literally can't feel pain. Kinda like takin' a puck to the shin with no pads and just keepin' on skatin'. This poor fella works in a bank, keepin' his head down, but then BAM-some real greasy crooks roll in, lookin' to mess up his day. And wouldn't ya know it, they swipe his girl, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), and now Nate's gotta go full send to get her back.Now, lemme tell ya, the action in this one? Absolutely filthy. The guy takes punches, stabs, full-on chair shots to the head, and he just keeps movin' like he's on a breakaway with no defense in sight. It's like watchin' a guy play three periods, triple OT, and still goin' strong. The fights are messy, the humor's darker than a rink at closing time, and the whole thing's got this John Wick-meets-Deadpool vibe-except our guy Nate ain't exactly a trained killer. More like a dude who's just real stubborn and doesn't know when to quit.Quaid nails it as Nate, makin' the guy both hilarious and a total disaster at the same time. And Amber Midthunder? Beauty performance. She ain't just some damsel, she's throwin' fists and helpin' clean up these goons like she's takin' out garbage day after a big party. The villains? Oh, buddy, they're slimier than bad ice, but fun to watch get what's comin' to 'em.Now, I ain't gonna say this is a perfect flick-some parts get a bit goofy, and the story's thinner than the ice in early November. But ya know what? It's a dang good time. You want deep, meaningful cinema? Go watch somethin' fancy. You want a rip-roarin' ride with blood, jokes, and a guy gettin' thrown through more glass than a Zamboni after a bar fight? Novocaine is your game, bud.Final verdict? 8 outta 10 pucks on the ice. Not a Cup-winning performance, but good enough to get ya through the winter. Give 'er a watch, grab a two-four, and enjoy the show.Cheers, ya beauties! üçÅüèí",

        "content": "I've read all of Simon Stalenhag's books, including The Electric State (which this movie is based on), and they are all reflective and thoughtful, with some exploring dark themes as well (The Electric State certainly does, though perhaps not as dark as The Labyrinth). In the book, there are corpses rotting away; due to their addiction to neurocasters, they've not fed themselves and have either died or become wasted away (the main character's foster mother has accidentally drowned in a pool whilst neurocasting). There are serious scenes of the ruins of the machines of war. There's a disturbing scene in which a robot brings a woman to orgasm. There are some quite horrific images of tangled messes of wires and metal stalking through the night, the abominations at Cape Victory, for example. My point is, the source material is written for adults...This is a kids movie. It has all of the out-of-place humour we expect in modern cinema. It has all of the over the top action we expect in modern cinema. It has the generic actors we expect in modern cinema. It has countless grand gestures, followed by a pause in which nothing happens, making every character appear ridiculous. It's either trying to be a not-particularly funny comedy or a not-particularly serious sci-fi.It's such a shame, because... imagine how this could have been. If this had have followed the plot of the book, been a dark and reflective film, with far fewer characters (even just the girl looking for her brother and the robot, perhaps with flashbacks to the foster parents), this could have been so good on screen. Unfortunately, it is so, so much less than the source material, and does the author a serious disservice.",

        "content": "\"The Electric State\" had all the ingredients for a great sci-fi adventure-an intriguing premise, a talented cast, and a massive $300+ million budget. Yet, despite these advantages, the film falls flat, failing to deliver anything beyond its initial setup.The movie starts strong, presenting a mysterious and engaging world that grabs attention. However, as the plot unfolds, it becomes increasingly childish and loses its depth, turning what could have been a thought-provoking sci-fi journey into something simplistic and uninspired. The film seems unsure of its target audience, oscillating between serious themes and a tone that feels more suited for a younger crowd.With a cast of this caliber, the performances should have been a highlight, but instead, they feel wasted on a script that doesn't give them much to work with.Especially Millie Bobby Brown feels underwhelming. Her acting lacks the emotional weight needed to carry the story, making it difficult to connect with her character.Visually, The Electric State is impressive, as expected from a film with such a massive budget. The CGI and world-building are well-crafted, but stunning visuals alone can't compensate for a lackluster narrative. Given the talent and resources behind the project, the final result is frustratingly mediocre.Ultimately, The Electric State is a missed opportunity. It starts with promise but quickly loses its way, relying on spectacle rather than substance. For a film of this scale, it should have offered much more than a pretty but hollow experience.",

It's tiresome and boring.Nothing about the performances are good, the production is very cheap and everything wasn't entertaining at all, it was dull and painful.",

        "content": "If viewers are looking for the haunting, dystopian vistas and devastating landscapes from Stalenhag's book, they'll be disappointed. But there are amazing and captivating effects, practical and digital, that build a unique world vision.What this film has going for it is Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown (more on them later), combining with a talented group of voice actors. Tucci is as good as ever but his part is thinly developed. Giancarlo Esposito brings his trademark gravitas and emotional weight to the story as well, in a role that, while not perfectly written, provides a surprising part of the movie's center.The Mr Peanut (Woody Harrelson) role, for me, didn't quite work. The \"bots\" I enjoyed were Herm ( unrecognizably voiced by Anthony Mackie) and the postal bot Penny Pal (Jenny Slate).There are definite plot holes, but considering the at times preposterous world we're in, is it worth complaining about story gaps? The robot cavalry makes a long sojourn to their final battlefield in a long caravan that doesn't get attacked, and improbably makes crazy good time doing it. And there's the disposal of a very central bot in a very uncaring way that wouldn't happen, but provides a sentimental wink at the viewer.Humorous, with lots of crash bang and very cool looking shots, especially with the giant sized robots, it's just fun enough, and interesting enough to watch all the way through. Pratt and Brown are fun-ish together, and bring their acting talents to a movie from a genre they are both very familiar with, so I do recommend it.But Brown feels wrong in this: her appearance as a bounced around foster child feels too \"glam\" at times, because she isn't grubby enough. Her acting also feels very much as though she's going through the paces, almost too self aware. Her fluffed up lip's lipstick and gloss doesn't fit with Keats' (Pratt) grimy, disheveled bootlegger.While Brown is given too many \"noble\" lines to deliver without coming off as sanctimonious, and Pratt is a little too much like Starlord at his most shrill and irritating; you can mostly forgive them because of their innate charm.The Russo brothers are definitely talented, so there is a high bar set before you watch the first scene.But they made a choice, the scary barren world that the book painted beautifully, is not the direction they picked. Instead they leaned into a little Spielberg, a little Lucas and some James Gunn. It doesn't make for a perfect movie, but hey, I watched the whole thing and wasn't mad that I did.There's a lot of kvetching about the big budget and where did it all go. I have two thoughts on that: one, those cool shots of the giant bots, and the very good animatronic facial expressions weren't cheap. Second, the movie definitely feels like there were a number of scenes that were cut. Quite a few actually. I'd definitely watch the full cut, if there is such a thing. There are many telling points, story jumps being one, but Holly Hunter is too much of an accomplished actress to appear in one scene, and a voiceover.So, give it a watch, you won't be mad that you did, and if you are, well, there's worse things to be mad at.Just don't expect to be blown away, and hoping for a new franchise.",

What annoyed me at first was the robot named Cosmo that has the same concept as Bumblebee where its voice is kinda broken and has to use records from TV show. Like why they use the same exact concept, I guess that big budget didn't go to the writing department. We only got introduced to the main characters like 3 minutes and then the siblings got into an accident OFFSCREEN leaving me puzzled and confused. What worse is the movie depends heavily to Millie Bobby Brown emotions and Netflix never learns that she has no range of it at all. She attempts to do it several times and failed miserably everytime. She really needs to watch other movies and learns how to potray emotions because I'm sure she'll get another role from Netflix. Overall this movie is so bad, the robots are kinda fun to watch if you are a 10 year old boy who phases out from Toy Story.",

        "title": "The Electric State - There's style, but what about substance?",
        "content": "Marketed as the most expensive film in history, The Electric State carried an enormous weight of expectations. Did this grand-scale promotion work in its favor? Perhaps. After all, if you factor in marketing expenses, the budget would be astronomical. So, what kind of movie did the Russo brothers create with their $320 million budget? Let's break it down.Set in 1997, after a devastating war between humans and machines, the film is packed with nostalgic elements-from the soundtrack to countless pop culture references of the era. The world-building is impressive, with a great variety of robotic designs that feel both inventive and visually distinct. The CGI, surprisingly, blends in seamlessly. Compared to a recent film like The Creator, the VFX here are just as good-if not better in certain moments.The story itself is fairly straightforward: a seemingly ordinary girl (Millie Bobby Brown) unknowingly holds the key to saving the world. Along the way, she finds allies in a rogue drifter (Chris Pratt) and his robot companion (Anthony Mackie). This unlikely duo makes for a fun buddy-movie dynamic, mixing the energy of a high schooler with the cynicism of a social outcast.Structurally, The Electric State feels like two different films. The first half leans heavily into childlike simplicity-almost to the point of being off-putting. However, once the second half kicks in, the pacing picks up, and the character dynamics become genuinely engaging.The film's strongest aspects? Without a doubt, its visuals and characters. Each character has a distinct presence, and the mix of humor, especially from the robots and Chris Pratt, works well. Pratt essentially plays a version of his Marvel character, which, honestly, suits him perfectly.Where does the film fall short? Ironically, in the very world it creates. The first 10 minutes set up a fascinating backstory-one that could have been the foundation for a much more compelling narrative. Instead, the film quickly moves past this, leaving us with a far less intriguing plot.Final Verdict:\nThe Electric State is exactly the kind of film that belongs on Netflix. It doesn't try to be something it's not; it's designed purely for entertainment. A solid choice for a casual movie night-fun, visually impressive, but ultimately forgettable.",

        "title": "Disappointed",
        "content": "A couple of years ago, Tales from the Loop hooked me with its quiet, haunting brilliance-Simon St√•lenhag's retro-futurist world brought to life with eerie depth. So when The Electric State, another St√•lenhag adaptation, hit Netflix today, March 14, 2025, I was primed for something special. Instead, I got a hollow shell of what could've been. Directed by the Russo brothers and backed by a $320 million budget, this film takes a stunning premise-rebellious robots in an alt-1990s America-and flattens it into a formulaic, clich√©-riddled slog. It's not just a step down from Loop; it's a stumble into Saturday morning cartoon territory.The setup sounds promising: Millie Bobby Brown plays Michelle, a loner chasing her brother Christopher, presumed dead but possibly reborn as a robot. Chris Pratt tags along as Keats, a smuggler with a quippy bot sidekick, Herman (Anthony Mackie). The visuals dazzle-hulking CGI robots roam desert wastelands, and the production design pops with quirky touches like Woody Harrelson's Mr. Peanut, a peanut-shaped bot with a top hat. There's a flicker of St√•lenhag's eerie aesthetic in the margins: abandoned diners, flickering neurocaster ads, a sense of a world gone wrong. But that's where the magic ends.The writing is the first offender-trite, predictable, and painfully safe. The book's slow-burn road trip, drenched in melancholy and existential dread, gets swapped for a Marvel-ized action-comedy romp. Gone is the neurocaster addiction plaguing society; instead, we get a watered-down \"tech bad, family good\" moral tacked onto a third act that feels focus-grouped to death. The Hive Mind, a chilling force in the novel, barely registers here-just a vague plot device to justify robot fights. It's as if the Russo brothers, fresh off Avengers blockbusters, couldn't resist sanding down every sharp edge for mass appeal.Then there's Chris Pratt. Once again, he's Star-Lord 2.0-cocky, charming, and utterly tiresome after so many outings. His Keats struts through the film cracking one-liners, but there's no depth, no arc, just a recycled persona coasting on charisma. Millie Bobby Brown fares better, bringing a flicker of grit to Michelle, but she's saddled with a script that doesn't know what to do with her. Anthony Mackie's Herman injects some fun-his bickering with Keats lands a few laughs-but it's not enough to salvage the mess. Even the supporting cast (Stanley Tucci, Giancarlo Esposito) feels wasted, popping in for cameos that add little.The Russo brothers' polish is undeniable-$320 million buys you slick robot battles and a glossy sheen. But it's all surface. The film mails it in, turning St√•lenhag's haunting vision into a generic sci-fi flick that could've been churned out by an algorithm. Critics agree: a 19% on Rotten Tomatoes and 31 on Metacritic reflect the consensus that this is a swing and a miss. For fans of the book, it's a betrayal; for newcomers, it's forgettable noise.Could it have been more? Absolutely. Tales from the Loop proved St√•lenhag's worlds can resonate on screen with patience and soul. The Electric State opts for noise over nuance, flash over feeling. It's not unwatchable-turn off your brain, and the visuals might carry you through a lazy Saturday night. But if you're expecting the weight of Loop or the book's quiet power, you'll leave disappointed. This isn't an adaptation; it's a cartoonish cash-in.",

The soundtrack had me hooked from the start, especially \"Mother\". This world was not populated with the usual shiny, pristine high-tech robotics, but vintage, retro, scuffed up metallic creatures that reminded me of tin toys that are pulled from dusty old attics on American Pickers.The size of some of the robots, and the desert landscapes that they inhabited were a feast for my imagination. The humor is subtle, and non-stop. It merits a second viewing to catch all the zingers. I won't bother to name the stars or directors, as any of you readers have probably seen the whole cast list by now. I kept asking myself, \"Why didn't they bother to release this in theaters?\" Netflix puts out great series and movies, that could easily be shown on the big screen. We are just spared seeing tie-in commercials for the movie on Taco Bell, McDonald's, or Volkswagen. Another thing, I watched this on my big screen in daylight, and will have to re-watch it in a dark room to see more details, and really \"feel\" it.I'll leave you with one final comment that I will paraphrase, \"Twinkies with beans\", \"What kind of beans?\"",

Mass appeal is no guarantee of excellence.The design of the movie appears to be based on a desire for mass appeal in a style which I can only describe as zeitgeisty. The problem with aiming for a kind of mass popularity is that you cannot afford to take a risk and try to be original. Everything is on the nose.Imagine a movie where they might use the track \"I Fought the Law\" by The Clash and then predict in what context it might be used. They may as well use \"Keep on Running\" in a chase scene. That is the level we are talking about here. And the score is no less predictable.The Electric State is film-making-by-numbers writ large. A big budget buys technical expertise, big stars, excellent effects et al but cannot guarantee quality.The casting is an exercise in laziness. Pratt sleepwalks as the rogue he always plays. MBB is the adult-playing-teen-who-looks-anything-but-a-teen. Need a Jobs-esque villain? Who would YOU pick? And as for GE, I love the guy as an actor but he is the typecast actor of his age.I have never read the source material, but if the author is anything other than heartbroken by this cinematic adaptation he must be artistically and creatively bankrupt.

THESE ARE MIND BOGGLING ESCAPADES! I was blown away by how totally original, unique, and hilariously dramatic the story ended up being, with the most perfect CGI claptrap robots anyone could ever imagine to boot.As the exciting new genre of Orphaned-Teen saves the world becomes more mainstream, it's fair to expect a film like The Electric State to be exceptionally mediocre. But, believe it or not, the result is Peak Content, a luxurious quilt of adventuresomeness loosely stitched with name-brand \"love & care\" - it's a work of pure intertextual genius, lightyears ahead of its time.Highly recommended for devoted fans of true underground cinema classics such as Fortnite, Trancers, Battlefield Earth, Splice, Pixels, Catwoman, Cannibal Holocaust, or Passport to Paris.Amen.",

The leads (Pratt and MBB) are wooden and have zero chemistry or charm. The rest is a dull, paint-by numbers first entry in what is obviously meant to be a trilogy that can be expanded into a full franchise that sells lots and lots of merch.",

It actually made me cry (I am easy to tear up so not a real plus lol).I don't really care about the budget being 300+ million it's not my money so it doesn't affect my view point but I must say for all the marketing they did this it is indeed mediocre overall. I think the CGI is the best of all? The plot and acting and choreography and everything else were all just average. Like it's just similar level to those early 2000s scifi movies they kept churning but had bad ratings? Aeon Flux, The Covenant, Ultraviolet etc.Anyway the plot is simple nothing complex. Millie wants to find her brother. Chris is there to help. Robots and humans were at war so the relationship between them is fragile. It had heartwarming and corny moments. Some of the humor was giving old Marvel movies. I feel like they can shave off some time still some pacing were dragging. There's no high action tension feel in here even during scenes that needed it nor are there any dynamic choreography and direction. The vibe reminds me more like I'm watching a children's movie? Overall it's an easy watch especially if you like robots like I do but yeah don't expect it to be life changing.",

        "content": "How can Netflix spend $300 million on this? Seriously. That's an astronomical budget, and yet, Electric States fails to deliver anything remotely fresh or engaging. The entire movie is a parade of wasted potential, a formulaic attempt at nostalgia-driven sci-fi that never manages to carve out its own identity.The story is painfully predictable, devoid of any real tension, and lacking the kind of twists that could have made it stand out. From the very first act, it feels like you already know exactly where it's going-beat by beat. There's no sense of discovery, no depth to the emotional core, and certainly no stakes that feel meaningful. It's as if the script was written by an AI trained on every blockbuster from the past decade but without any human soul to make it resonate.And let's talk about the casting. What exactly was the vision here? Are we watching a Guardians of the Galaxy spin-off mixed with Ready Player One? Because if that's what you want, just go watch those movies instead. They do it better. This film borrows so heavily from existing franchises that it never establishes its own footing. It tries to be quirky but lands somewhere between forced and awkward. Some performances feel out of place, others seem like they're from a completely different movie. The characters are either too flat or too over-the-top, leaving you indifferent to their journey.Then there's the visual spectacle-yes, it looks expensive, but what good is that if the world-building lacks depth? The CGI is polished, sure, but it feels hollow. A beautiful but lifeless landscape, much like the movie itself. A $300M budget should buy more than just visual effects; it should bring an experience, a connection, a story that stays with you. Instead, Electric States gives us a soulless, generic blockbuster that evaporates from memory the moment the credits roll.It had the potential to be something truly gripping. Instead, it's a waste of anticipation and time.",

        "content": "In the Lost Lands may superficially resemble a Resident Evil film, but it's nothing like Resident Evil. It's a dark, brooding, gothic western/dark fantasy film. Courtesy of returning editor Niven Howie (no more Doobie White) the pacing is both very brisk yet every scene feels like it has enough room to breathe, room to brood. The atmosphere is immaculate. The film's violence, when it erupts, is incredibly brutal.As an adaptation, I feel the marketing did a huge disservice because practically everything important from George R. R. Martin's short story is present, just fleshed out and placed into a framework where the film tries to make the central premise plausible. It's no wonder George liked the movie.The film's supporting cast feel a lot more fleshed out than many PWSA films despite the lean 101 minute runtime. Supporting characters feeling undercooked has always been a problem for him, and here it feels like he avoids that issue. Dave and Milla both give excellent performances, Arly Jover is magnetically hateable as the film-original antagonist Ash, and the rest of the cast put in strong, memorable performances.The visual design isn't really going for naturalism. I can see it being controversial, but I think the film absolutely achieves what it set out to do. A combination of incredibly well designed practical sets and bleak digital environments combine to produce extremely striking imagery. It's easily the most striking images of any PWSA film since Event Horizon. The word \"heavy metal\" gets thrown around a lot, but that describes this film.The film's primary weakness is the execution of the ending, particularly the last few section. It tries to have its cake and eat it, too regarding the source material, and it gives off the impression of a film that had its ending reshot or otherwise adjusted in response to test screenings. However, the rest of the film is so strong that the slightly wobbly ending isn't enough to derail it.In a lot of ways, the film reminds me of The Keep, a film PWSA is quite obviously fixated on. Incredibly bold imagery, a compelling electronic score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger, and a weirdly abrupt and jarring ending.I don't know how the wider audience is going to view this film, but I really liked it, and I think it will become a cult classic. There's nothing else like it. Some will compare it to Resident Evil, or Mad Max, but it's not really like either of them in its actual execution and tone.",

        "content": "In the Lost Lands\" is not just a bad movie-it's a masterclass in how to take an intriguing concept and strip it of anything remotely compelling. Paul W. S. Anderson, the king of soulless adaptations, once again proves that he can turn even rich source material into a dull, lifeless, CGI-infested wasteland. This so-called \"dark fantasy epic\" feels more like a two-hour endurance test, complete with cringe-worthy dialogue, terrible pacing, and a story that stumbles over itself before falling flat on its face.Milla Jovovich, ever loyal to her director husband, sleepwalks through the role of Gray Alys, a \"powerful\" witch who does absolutely nothing of consequence. Dave Bautista's Boyce is reduced to a grunting sidekick whose only personality trait is looking annoyed. Arly Jover's villain, Ash, is as generic as they come-another discount \"mysterious antagonist\" who seems to exist solely because the film needs a bad guy.Visually, it's an absolute mess. The CGI looks cheap, the sets are empty and lifeless, and the action sequences-supposedly a highlight-are choppy, weightless, and completely devoid of impact. The editing is so erratic that it feels like the movie was pieced together by someone who had never seen a film before. The color grading makes everything look like it was shot through a dirty fish tank, and the soundtrack is as forgettable as the script itself.The biggest crime of In the Lost Lands is that it's boring. There's no tension, no stakes, and no reason to care. It pretends to have deep lore but refuses to develop it, instead throwing vague fantasy jargon at the audience and hoping it sticks. Even George R. R. Martin's weak endorsement-saying it \"captured his voice better than other adaptations\"-feels more like a desperate attempt to salvage its reputation than genuine praise.By the time the credits roll, the only real mystery is how this ever got made. A movie with this much potential should not be this awful. In the Lost Lands is a soulless, plodding, incoherent disaster that even the most forgiving fantasy fans should avoid at all costs. If you're looking for a dark fantasy adventure, watch literally anything else.\"",

The cinematography, the production design, the palette choices, the use of light and shadow are all great.But the story is incredibly boring and nonsensical. The dialogue sounds like it was generated by a poorly coded AI. And all of the actors - including Bautista and Jovovich, both talented, charismatic performers - are reduced to delivering their lines as if the director asked them to intentionally sound wooden and forced, almost like a parody of a fantasy movie, but an unfunny, slog of a parody.I would have walked out of this - a thing I have only done in the middle of only one other movie my life (the last \"Terrifier\") - if it were not for the fact that my wife fell asleep after the first act, and I didn't want to wake her up.I would recommend that no one waste their time with this movie.

It will NOT be people's favorite film of this year, but according to my history of Resident Evil films and The Gorge that I recently watched thanks to Apple+ I think for me is going to be fantastic besides the cast will do great, they put hard work into this film and I have to gave them credit.

The queen of this city approaches the cursed witch Gray Alys (Milla Jovovich) with a request - grant her the power of the werewolf. Because Gray Alys is unable to turn down any requests, she agrees and hires hunter Boyce (Dave Bautista) to take her into the titular Lost Lands to seek out the last remaining werewolf.Complicating this quest is the fact that the Church which shares power in the city is determined to hang Gray Alys as a heretic, and the Patriarch of the Church sees an opportunity to take down the queen and sieze absolute power himself.Needless to say, the church pursuit provides plenty of opportunity for Gray Alys and Boyce to blow away, gun down, and neck-snap an unfeasible amount of bad guys along the way.It's a stunning film in parts, with a decent twist at the end. But the villains (especially the Church baddies) are so one-note and inept that I was genuinely surprised to find out that this is based on a George RR Martin story.Still, all in all it's a fun ride for 100 minutes and it looks great on the big screen.",

        "content": "\"In The Lost Lands\" sets the stage for an action-packed adventure, starring the duo of Dave Bautista and Milla Jovovich. Unfortunately, despite its promising premise, the film ends up being a muddled mix of contrasting elements that fail to deliver on its potential.The movie attempts to blend light-hearted banter with fast-paced action scenes, but rather than complementing each other, these two elements feel disjointed. The interactions between Bautista and Jovovich are meant to bring an engaging dynamic to the screen, yet their relationship comes across as confusing and inconsistent. It's as if the film can't quite decide if it wants to be a buddy action flick or a more serious, high-stakes adventure. The result? A love-hate chemistry that never quite resonates.The monsters featured in the film are a notable aspect, with two very distinct types making an appearance. However, while they could have added an exciting layer to the narrative, their presence doesn't feel fully explored or impactful. The action sequences, though fast-paced, seem to lack any real depth or excitement, leaving the audience somewhat detached.The pacing of the movie is another point of frustration. For all the action and monster encounters, the film still manages to drag in places. Despite the thrilling backdrop, I found myself zoning out at times, wondering why the story failed to maintain my attention. The blend of humor, action, and monstrous threats should have kept things lively, but instead, it felt like a series of missed opportunities.In conclusion, \"In The Lost Lands\" is a film that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. The relationship between Bautista and Jovovich offers a flicker of potential, but the inconsistent tone, lackluster action, and overall pacing make it a difficult movie to invest in. While it may appeal to those who enjoy lighter, more chaotic fantasy films, I found it hard to stay engaged.",

Unsurprising to me, this movie was a massive pile of garbage.Positives for In the Lost Lands (2025):\nFirst off, the ideas of this world is really interesting especially given that George R. R. Martin wrote it. Dave Bautista is very good as one of our co-leads. That's all I've got to say for the positives.Negatives for In the Lost Lands (2025):\nThis short story and world by George R. R. Martin are completely butchered by Paul W. S. Anderson, who hasn't made a great movie since 2004 with both Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004). This movie feels like another cheap attempt for him to show off his wife Milla Jovovich kick ass and it falls flat. The story feels like a series of events that happening for the sole purpose of getting to horrible action sequences. Aside from Dave Bautista, I didn't care about any of the characters. The action sequences are ruined by the stupid ass goofy Paul W. S. Anderson style of quick cut editing. And finally, the ending was very confusing, but by the time I reached that point I stopped giving a damn about the movie.Overall, In the Lost Lands (2025) was yet another reminder as to why Paul W. S. Anderson is a part of my rogues gallery and a horrendous butchering of George R. R. Martin's work.",

        "content": "2 out of 5 stars.In the Lost Lands is a bad fantasy epic film that is based on a story from George Martin. Which the story is brief and lacking substance.Pros:The film is very fast moving. It's a Paul W. S. Anderson film which means it's going to be quickly paced. Plenty of action. And mindless entertainment. Well it is fast paced but it lacks every thing else in the film.Cons:It is one of Paul W. S. Anderson worst films in his history. The Three Musketeers had a somewhat decent entertainment value. I loved the Resident Evil films for what it was. And it was not much. It was plenty of entertainment. Even his Monster Hunter. In the Lost Lands is a film that is a combo of genres of gunslingers, westerns. And post apocalyptic. Mad Max with a bit of werewolves, witches and monsters. And a cult of church fanatics that went insane. Film was all over the place. It was just boring.The visual effect were throughout the movie from sets and back drop. Creating the hazy, brooding atmosphere, and dark lighting. Film just felt like one big hazy dream. Lots of camera lens flares that was used for the tone of the film just felt like a cheap production.The plot was fast and lacking development with the story. It was difficult to care for any characters.The action sequences were disappointing. Paul Andersons worst films on handling the action. It was brief in most scenes. And lacking the entertainment value. The climatic fight with Werewolf and Witch was short and quick. It was hard to care for it.Milla Jovovich and Dave Bautista were okay with there roles. The script had cheesy dialogue filled for there characters and lacking any depth for them. The villain was very forgettable and was just there to be the person chasing the characters throughout the film.Overall, it was one bad film that action was boring, even the story and direction. It was shocking to see Paul Anderson slipping as a filmmaker. Which he does a great job in creating blockbuster entertainment. This fantasy film is not one of them.",

        "content": "4/10 STARS - In the Lost Lands is based on a George R R Martin short story of the same name from 1982. Milla Jovovich stars as Gray Alys, a witch who has to grant the wish of everyone who comes to her, even though granting those wishes has unintended consequences for those who ask. She is sent by the queen to the Lost Lands to obtain the power of turning into a werewolf. Before embarking on her journey, Alys enlists the aid of a mysterious hunter named Boyce, played by Dave Bautista. Unfortunately, Milla Jovovich doesn't have the best track record for starring in quality films and In the Lost Lands is no exception. There were some things I did like about this movie: the cinematography felt like something that came from the pages of a graphic novel, similar in some ways to a film like Sin City. And the framework of the story itself is actually pretty solid. The issues are largely in the execution of the story, which probably would have been much better served as a limited series type of production for a streaming platform. Given the vastness of the world, the various characters involved, as well as the political and religious issues at play in the background, a film of an hour and 41 minutes doesn't give it enough space to make it feel fully fleshed out and satisfying, reducing most of the characters to almost clownish figures -- hollow shells of what could have been more interesting depictions. And with a rather hefty budget of more than 55 million, this film will have an uphill battle just to break even.",

        "content": "It's not every day that you stumble upon a movie that feels like it was penned by George R. R. Martin after one too many glasses of Dornish red-and then handed over to a director who said, \"Let's make it weirder.\" Yet here we are, in the sprawling, brutal, and utterly bonkers adaptation of In the Lost Lands, where dragons and political intrigue are replaced by Milla Jovovich's dagger-sharp stares and Dave Bautista's colossal biceps.Jovovich stars as Gray Alys, a sorceress-for-hire who's as morally ambiguous as a Westerosi noble at a wedding. Alys is tasked with venturing into the titular Lost Lands to retrieve a mystical wish-because, of course, that never goes wrong. Jovovich brings her usual blend of icy badassery and haunting melancholy, channeling the energy of someone who's been through way too much but still gets up every morning to conquer magical wastelands.Then there's Bautista as Boyce, her brooding, muscle-bound companion. Think of him as the Hound, but with a softer side buried beneath layers of scar tissue and cryptic one-liners. Bautista's performance is equal parts charm and gruff intensity, and his chemistry with Jovovich is the beating heart of this film. Together, they're like an apocalyptic buddy comedy team who could take down armies-and argue over the best way to do it.Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes, assuming your idea of a feast includes dystopian landscapes, twisted creatures, and more ominous lighting than a goth-themed nightclub. The special effects are impressive, but the real magic lies in the intricate costume design and world-building, which feel ripped straight from Martin's fever dreams.The plot, however, is a different beast altogether. It's not so much a cohesive narrative as it is a series of beautifully chaotic vignettes. The story leaps from betrayal to battle to existential musings on the cost of power with the grace of a drunken dragon. It's ambitious, sure, but at times it feels like the filmmakers tried to cram an entire A Song of Ice and Fire novel into two hours.Still, for all its narrative quirks, In the Lost Lands is undeniably entertaining. It's the kind of movie that doesn't apologize for being over-the-top because it knows that's exactly what you came for. And let's be honest: who wouldn't want to see Milla Jovovich and Dave Bautista fighting monsters and each other while pondering the nature of wishes?And let's not mince words: In the Lost Lands is, hands down, the best movie with a queen in it right now. Unlike certain recent releases that reduced their royal heroines to preachy monologues and questionable creative choices (looking at you, Snow White), Gray Alys rules her scenes with commanding grace and unapologetic ruthlessness. Forget woodland critters and apple symbolism-this is a queen who'd hex you for asking too many questions and still look fabulous doing it.In the end, In the Lost Lands isn't perfect, but it's a wild, weird, and wonderfully dark ride. It's like a George R. R. Martin story brought to life by someone who decided to dial the chaos up to eleven-and we wouldn't have it any other way.",

Everything else is a wasteland that has individual pockets of people, like a rest stop for travelers or a country styled store for supplies.

        "content": "Just watched In the Lost Lands and I'm honestly speechless (in the best way possible).I don't usually write movie reviews, but this one deserves a little love. I went into it expecting a dark fantasy adventure, but wow - it completely pulled me into another world. You know when a film just feels different from the first scene? That's this one. And the person behind all that magic? Paul W. S. Anderson. I have to give him serious credit - he directed the hell out of this movie.From the very beginning, it's clear this isn't some cookie-cutter fantasy. The tone is dark, moody, almost poetic. The world-building is wildly original - eerie landscapes, strange creatures, a vibe that's both ancient and futuristic all at once. It's not flashy for the sake of being flashy - everything feels so intentional. The way Anderson builds the atmosphere is honestly hypnotic.One thing I absolutely loved: he doesn't rush anything. He lets the story breathe. There are moments of total silence where all you hear is the wind or footsteps in the snow - and somehow that says more than any line of dialogue could. He really trusts the audience to sit with the emotion, the tension, the stillness. That kind of confidence is rare and refreshing.Milla Jovovich is a force in this. Her character, Gray Alys, is mysterious, powerful, and so beautifully layered. You're never quite sure what to make of her - which is exactly the point. She's not a typical hero or villain, and Milla plays that ambiguity perfectly. And Dave Bautista... wow. He's got this quiet strength that just pulls you in. His scenes are heavy, meaningful, but never overdone.But seriously, the biggest standout for me is the direction. Anderson made some bold choices with this film, and I respect that so much. It's not trying to be safe or conventional. It's raw, surreal, and almost meditative in some places. You can tell he had a very clear vision - and he committed to it 100%. That takes guts. And the result? A film that actually feels like an experience, not just something you watch and forget.There's this one scene - no spoilers - where Gray Alys is just walking across an endless, icy wasteland, her cloak blowing in the wind, nothing but silence around her. It gave me chills. That's when I knew I wasn't just watching a movie - I was witnessing art.Is it for everyone? Probably not. If you're looking for a classic action-packed fantasy with dragons and battles every five minutes, this might not be it. But if you love stories that take their time, that make you think, feel, and question - this is one you don't want to miss.So yeah. Hats off to Paul W. S. Anderson. This movie was a risk, and it totally paid off. I'm already planning to watch it again.",

And of course we have some cult leader baddies who want to stop everything and Milla's power.They go on a journey together into the lost lands and come across some challenges along the way.Both characters play their parts fairly well, it could easily have been a future entry for resident evil.Easy to watch, nothing outstanding but good enough way to pass the time.",

Twilight run, no one other in theatre, 2010 visial effects, Dave tries to act, Mila just tries something, no sure it is working but fine. Some views/frames or shots, usualy distant or basic look fine, 2 last transitions ok(with moon and days). Fights consists of cuts, somewhat dissapponting. Some effects of rocks look bad. I like the colour gamma, sepia type. The whole film makes impression like it should be released like 15 years ago or be like b tier entertainment in sense, that it should be like a game, maybe with some VR. If you expect any seriousness or anything that doesn't contain bull****, that you are wrong way. You know the film starts with absurd type ****, when someone just goes to Jovovich and asks her something, AND RIGHT AFTER THAT the other guy asks to CANCEL THAT WISH and witch agrees because( i know, here expect me to write \"because f\"** you\" and not like you wrong) SHE ALWAYS AGREES. My god that was good! At least it was better than first version of Rebel Moon(but honestly it hard to find anything worse)",

I never really understood what was at stake or why I should care about the characters. There were moments that tried to be deep or emotional, but nothing landed. The dialogue was especially weak-almost every scene felt like it was just dragging along with no real tension or impact.Visually, I expected something more immersive, but the CGI looked cheap, and the world they tried to build felt flat and lifeless. Even the action scenes, which could've saved parts of it, were underwhelming.By the end, I just felt frustrated. This had potential, but it ended up being a messy, forgettable fantasy film. If I had to rate it, I'd give it a 4 out of 10-mostly for the cast trying their best with a script that gave them nothing to work with.",

        "content": "I had not watched anything from this 2025 movie prior to sitting down to watch it. But I figured that there was potential here, as it was starring Milla Jovovich. And I have to admit that the premise of a post-apocalyptic setting did seem mighty alluring.But what director Paul W. S. Anderson delivered here was essentially just another \"Resident Evil\" movie, just without the T-Virus and the zombies. Or at least that the sensation and vibe I was getting from the movie, as the story unfolded and we got to know the characters. Yeah, Gray Alys (as Milla Jovovich's character was named in this movie) was essentially just a variant of the Alice character from the \"Resident Evil\" movies. Except for being a clone, she was a witch with magical powers, but the same fighting skills and also using the same weaponry.The storyline in \"In the Lost Lands\" was pretty straightforward, although a bit of a strange mixture of many different genres scrambled into one. Sure, it was watchable and entertaining enough for the mindless action fantasy that it turned out to be, but don't get your hopes up for a stellar storytelling event here. I have not read the short story, from writer George R. R. Martin, that this movie was based upon, so I don't know how true screenwriters Constantin Werner and Paul W. S. Anderson were to the source material.The acting performances in the movie were fair enough taking into consideration the material they had to work with. The movie does have some familiar faces on the cast list, with the likes of Milla Jovovich, Dave Bautista and Fraser James. Fraser James really stood out in the movie with his performance as The Patriarch. I am by no means a fan of Dave Bautista, and \"In the Lost Land\" didn't convince me otherwise.What worked out the most in \"In the Lost Lands\" was the special effects. The CGI effects looks good and there were some nice creature designs, and the props and wardrobe departments definitely worked their magic quite well.This movie is an odd mixture of multiple genres, and thus it was a little bit hard to fully get submerged into. But it proved to be fair enough entertainment for the mindless action that it was.My rating of director Paul W. S. Anderson's 2025 movie \"In the Lost Lands\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

There are moments that hint at a deeper, richer world, and a few surprises that add some excitement. But the pacing drags, making it hard to stay fully engaged, and the story doesn't develop in a way that feels particularly compelling. It's not that it's bad, just that it never reaches the heights it seems to be aiming for.That said, if you're a fan of the actors (which I am), there's still enjoyment to be found here. It's the kind of film that has its moments but ultimately doesn't leave a lasting impact.Would I recommend it? Maybe-for die-hard fans of Bautista and Jovovich or those who just want a bit of fantasy escapism. But for anyone looking for a truly gripping story, this one might get lost in the shuffle.",

Everyone thinks of the Resident Evil franchise when they hear about this couple, because Anderson is the director of the franchise, and Milla plays the main role. The character's name is Elise. Surprisingly, in March 2025, Jovovich again played the role of Elise, but this time in the role of a werewolf. It is difficult to say whether Grace Elise is a negative character. The fact is that throughout the film, the director has voiced feminist messages. For example, a domineering queen who wants to find a method by which she can turn from a human into a werewolf. For this, the queen asks the werewolf, Grace, for help. Men are relegated to the background. This theory is fully confirmed by the partnership between the two main characters. Grace Ellis and the hunter-Boyce. Throughout the film, they were allies. In fact, the audience saw a magnum opus of female manipulation. I would single out several scenes. 1) A card game in a bar. Boyce sits alone and quietly drinks a beer. At this time, Ellis suddenly appears, defeats Boyce at cards and buys him out. Boyce was hired by the witch to take Ellis to the deserted lands and kill the werewolf there. 2) The scene of Boyce's death. I dare say that this is a rather boring and banal spectacle, the last quarter of the film corrected it and woke up the audience a little. The werewolf whose death the witch wanted was Boyce himself. 3) The resuscitation of the hunter.",

The witch seeks out a guide (Bautista) to get her across the lost lands to get to where the werewolf hangs out. So they set off on their adventure while being followed by the church out for her blood. Sounds cool enough for a dark fantasy adventure film right? Oh God. Paul W S Anderson and his wife Yovovich need to stop with the same old tired crap. I thought I was watching a film from 2002. It's 2025 for crying out loud. The whole film is shot in green screen and the CGI is early 2000s. They spent 50 million on this apparently. Did the budget go on Mila's hideous wig? The plot is basic, the special effects look good in some parts and rubbish in most, Bautista is phoning it in, the bad guys are cardboard cartoon cut outs, zero personality. Yovovich does her usual muttering bad ass thing. The two leads have no chemistry at all. They also seem to ride on CGI horses, we only see close ups of their faces and far away shots of them on horses which is weird and cheap looking. It totally takes you out of what little there is to keep your interest and makes you laugh at it most of the time. I also think this is one of R. R. Martin's properties. Good God, he should have never have sold the rights to these clowns, Anderson and the producers. There are hints of a sequel at the end as usual these days but don't hold your breath.",

We've got a city where most of the inhabitants are slaves, dominated by an Overlord who uses a fascist church to keep people down. Gray Alys (Milla Jovovich} is a witch who is in conflict with the church's enforcer Ash (Arly Jover) but the Overlord's Queen (Amara Okereke) sends Gray Alys on a quest to secure her the powers of a Werewolf (it's a bit complicated). Alys links up with the hunter Boyce (Dave Bautista) and they're soon trekking across a desolate landscape, the ruins of cities blasted by nuclear weapons. Mutant creatures roam these blasted heaths. Though the leader of the nastiest of them looks like an evil Groot and the Werewolf when we eventually meet him has the head of a Were Pooh bear, still he's savage enough. The film has the feel of a Western, with Ash as a nemesis in pursuit of Boyce and Alys, killing and burning along the way, she is the ultimate Blackhat. Some great imagery, especially the choreographed fights and the Steampunk armoured train. But it just doesn't all add up, best wait to watch this one on TV.

It's not atrocious, as some critics allege (24% of RT)The movie's biggest strength is that the action scenes, at times, are pretty stylish and cool. The two-headed snake that Batista uses is great. I'm also a fan of Milla Jovovich. She is alright in this movie. The movie's visuals are nice at times, and there's an unexpected, nicely-delivered twist at the endBut there are a ton of faults -- the movie has a bit of episodic feel, as it sometimes jumps from one event or storyline to another. Batista and Milla Jovovich are supposed to be romantically linked in the movie, but they have no chemistry. When Batista urges her to turn around and come back with him, I was kinda taken aback because I didn't know their relationship was romantic the whole time.Another issue is that the movie's visuals, while nice at times, often like a knockoff of Mad Max: Fury Road (with a little bit of Zack Synder's \"300\" mixed in too). Some of the henchman that Batista and Milla fight look almost exactly like the bald henchmen in Fury Road. The desert setting as well as the plot thread involving the Overlord + Queen are also reminiscent of Fury Road.I feel that the characters are not developed enough. We don't know much about the backstory of either Milla Jovovich or Batista's characters. There are an assortment of other characters throughout, such as the Queen, the overlord, Jerais, the Patriarch, and a few others: none of these characters stand out as memorable or interesting. The political content, such as the Church vs Witches or a power struggle for the Overlord's power, feel undeveloped4.5/10.",

I say oddly because I really enjoyed all of the cast here, it's just the story that totally failed to claw me in; I honestly would struggle to give you a suitable recap of the plot even so soon after watching it.Those onscreen, however, are all pluses. Dave Bautista is good, so is Milla Jovovich. Arly Jover works, as do Amara Okereke and Fraser James. Simon L√∂√∂f is the weakest main cast member and even he is fine. It is rare for me to not like a film where the cast bring positive displays.The world built and the effects used looked pleasing enough to me too, it really is just the plot that hampers this one for me personally.

Gray Alys (Milla Jovovich) is a powerful witch who cannot deny anybody's request but it always comes with a cost. She is sentenced to hang, but she cannot be hung. The Queen asks her for a shapeshifter's powers. Boyce (Dave Bautista) is a drifter connected to both.The writing is not good. When all the reveals happen in the last act, I stop caring well before then. I am surprised that this is based on George R. R. Martin's work. Maybe he should have done more with GoT. It's only a short story. The biggest slice of the blame pie has to be Paul W. S. Anderson. He cannot write a cohesive script to save his life and he should consider using a different visual effects house. His work is not good.",

However, see a trailer that makes a film look like one of the worst of all time - and when it arrives and it's . . . Not good, but not the worst film of all time, and I feel better about it than I might otherwise.In a post-apocalyptic future Gray Alys (Milla Jovovich) is a witch who cannot turn down any requests made of her. Despite her being a heretic, The Queen Melange (Amara Okereke) asks Alys to transfer the power of a shapeshifting werewolf to her. Alys heads out into the wasteland to hunt said Werewolf, having secured the help of Boyce (Dave Bautista) a hunter, though they are pursued by the church, in the form of Enforcer Ash (Arly Jover) and an army of military clerics.I mean this is, in many ways, exactly the sort of awful stuff that Paul W S Anderson has been providing for years. He drags his wife, Milla Jovovich, kicking and punching around an unconvincing CGI background, things explode and some set pieces happen. I do think this one looks particularly awful, relative to the last few \"Resident Evil\" films, for example.This does have a couple of saving graces though. One is the performances of the leads. Jovovich is never bad in these films but she's ably supported by Dave Bautista here and they do have some chemistry together. Also, the story, which looks like a confusing mess in the trailer actually holds together better than I thought it would, even having a couple of surprises in it. I'm temped to give that credit to George R R Martin, on whose short story this was based - but I've never read it, so I can't say for certain that it is the case.Provided you're not expecting this to actually be any good I don't think this is as awful as it looks.

Almost every second of the movie felt like he was forced to act, and not like there is anyone in Bollywood who can force Salman Khan. Clearly shows he has no interest in acting anymore. Also the writers should try something different, again all similar storyline of B-wood. Dailogues felt pretty unreal, Rashmika also seem like she was reading the dailogues off a book lol, not even a single good delivery. Entire film felt like a disaster in terms of acting, thanks to Kajal saving some acting in second half. The film is a great product for Mass Action loving audience, not for core cinema lovers. Has a weak storyline, whole lot of flaws, and ofcourse no logic in fight scenes. One time entertainer as a mass action film nothing else.",

The way the film builds its narrative, with each scene adding to the overall progression, is a key strength that elevates it above his previous films.PerformanceSalman Khan's performance in this film is undoubtedly one of his best. He brings a new level of vulnerability to his character, which adds layers to his usual on-screen persona. For the first time in a while, we see him in a role that demands not just action, but real emotion, and he delivers it with finesse. His comic timing, emotional depth, and action sequences are all executed flawlessly, making this film a testament to his versatility as an actor.His chemistry with the supporting cast is also noteworthy. The camaraderie with his co-stars feels natural, and together they create some of the most memorable moments of the film.

        "content": "Sikandar: The Worst Movie of the Decade - Even Bullets Couldn't Escape the Stupidity!Bollywood has given us disasters before-Race 3, Radhe, Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan-but Sikandar is in a league of its own. If you thought Salman Khan had hit rock bottom, he just borrowed a JCB and started digging deeper.Forget Avatar and Baahubali, Sikandar deserves an award for \"Best Use of CGI to Make an Actor Look Younger (and Still Failing).\" The VFX team worked overtime, yet Salman's face keeps shifting between Maine Pyar Kiya and Madame Tussauds Wax Museum Reject. At times, his face looks so smooth you'd think it was buffed with sandpaper, and in other scenes, the CGI forgets to load, leaving us staring at a man who's clearly lived through multiple decades but refuses to admit it.And then there's Mandharika, a heroine so young next to Salman that their romantic moments feel like a family-friendly festival ad gone horribly wrong. Every time she smiles at him, audiences expect her to say: \"Papa, mujhe naye school bag chahiye!\" (Dad, I want a new school bag!). Their chemistry is so awkward that even an arranged marriage couple meeting for the first time would look more convincing.The action sequences deserve a separate obituary. If you love slow motion, this movie will be your personal torture chamber. Every punch takes so long to land that by the time Salman's fist reaches the villain's face, fuel prices have gone up again. The final fight is so slow that people went to the washroom, ordered food, and came back-all before the next frame loaded.But the biggest highlight of this cinematic garbage fire? The bulletproof steel sheet scene. In one jaw-droppingly dumb moment, Salman hides behind a thin, flimsy tin roof sheet-the kind people use for cheap shop shutters-and somehow, BULLETS CAN'T PENETRATE IT. Yes, full-speed bullets fired by trained henchmen get stopped by a material that even a light breeze can shake. Apparently, this sheet is stronger than Captain America's shield, and Salman hides behind it like a kid playing peekaboo. At this point, the audience had given up on physics, logic, and their will to live. If only they sold bulletproof helmets for people watching this movie.The story itself is a medical science horror show. The plot revolves around organ donation, but the logic behind it is so mind-numbingly stupid that even a 5th grader would call it out. Salman's wife donates her heart, lungs, and God knows what else, and magically, every single recipient shows up in the movie. The best part? The same doctor performs every transplant-heart, lungs, kidney, liver-he's a one-man Apollo Hospital! One scene features a 30-year-old woman's lungs being transplanted into a 9-year-old boy. How did they fit? Who cares! Apparently, Salman's world operates on USB plug-and-play organ transplants.And then, the dialogues. Oh, the dialogues! If bad writing was a crime, Sikandar's script would get life imprisonment. Some absolute gems:Villain: \"Mujhe koi nahi hara sakta!\" (No one can defeat me!)Salman: \"Jab tak Sikandar hai, tab tak zindagi ka calendar nahi badlega!\" (As long as Sikandar is here, life's calendar won't change!)\nCalendar ka kya kasoor tha, bhai? (What did the poor calendar do to you?)Mandharika (to Salman): \"Mujhe tumse ishq ho gaya hai!\" (I have fallen in love with you!)\nAudience reaction: \"Didi, Rakhi ka festival toh August mein hota hai!\" (Sister, Rakhi festival is in August!)And just when you think this cinematic punishment is over, comes the climax. After two and a half hours of painfully slow action, cringeworthy dialogues, and science-defying nonsense, Salman faces off against the villain. We expect an epic conclusion. What do we get?Salman forgives him.YES. After all the build-up, the speeches, the bulletproof tin sheet stupidity, Salman just says: \"Main tujhe maaf karta hoon.\" (I forgive you.)At this point, the villain himself looked confused-he probably felt cheated for even participating in this nonsense. Meanwhile, the audience was ready to riot. Even the Race 3 climax looked like The Dark Knight compared to this.Final verdict? If Bollywood had an official \"Worst Movie Ever\" trophy, Sikandar would win in all categories. Compared to this, Radhe and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan look like Oscar-winning films. If you love self-inflicted torture, go ahead and watch it. If not, run while you still can.‚≠ê Rating: -5/5 stars (Extra negative points for making bullets look weaker than plastic spoons.)",

That's exactly how I felt after watching Sikandar-except I never actually napped, because the movie wouldn't let me. Not with its relentless lack of plot, bizarre dialogues, and action sequences that made me question the laws of physics.The film apparently has a \"social message,\" but even by the end credits, I was as clueless about it as I am about why I even bought the tickets. Maybe the message was \"Don't waste your time on a Sunday afternoon.\"I took my uncle along, thinking it would be a great bonding experience. At one point, I was seriously considering whether a power cut at the theater would be a blessing in disguise. But no, Sikandar powered through like a relentless telegram from a broker who's looking to short sell.The only silver lining? Ice cream. Post-movie, we drowned our sorrows in frozen desserts, which, unlike Sikandar, actually made sense and left a sweet aftertaste.Final rating: (quater star for the ice cream, none for the movie).",

Despite its emotional premise, the execution feels bland and fails to create a meaningful impact.What went wrong?‚ùå Logicless action scenes - Fights are completely unrealistic, with Salman defeating enemies in the most ridiculous ways. Even for a mass film, it goes overboard.Slow and outdated screenplay - The emotional drama is forced, and the storytelling feels like something from the early 2000s.Misleading marketing - The trailer promised an action-packed entertainer, but the movie is just a stretched-out emotional mess.Zero freshness - The same old formula with nothing new to offer.The only decent part is the music (Zohra Jabeen, Bam Bam Bhole), but even that isn't enough to save the film.Final Verdict: Sikandar is one of Salman Khan's weakest films in recent years. Even hardcore fans might struggle to sit through it. If you expect good action and a strong story, stay away.I suggest you not to waste your time on this movie.

I was expecting a fun masala movie which was enjoyable from start to finish. But the movie makers had another plan. It was a huge letdown and disappointed a lot of people in the cinema hall who had the same expectation of this movie. The story doesnt make any sense and a lot of the movie seems forced and void of any logic.The movie seems unnecessarily preachy and the dialogues seem monotonous and they dont have the impact or the intended energy required in big movies. Rashmika and Kajal try hard to save this disaster but their efforts go in vain due to sloppy story telling. The music is another factor in bringing down the movie. Overall, it reminds you of a phrase - blink and a miss.",

It's even more baffling that OTT platforms shelled out Rs. 100 crores for this mess.It's truly disheartening to see the state of Bollywood cinema at this point, beyond the realm of mere complaints. It's clear now that these poorly made films aren't the result of creative shortcomings but rather a deliberate attempt to exploit a gullible audience that has few to no other alternatives for weekend entertainment apart from watching films.This film is completely directionless.

Unlike his memorable performance in Sultan, this film suffers from a palpable absence of energy-not only in his acting but also in the fight sequences, which appear to be mere afterthoughts. It is as if Salman is content with merely showing up on screen, relying on a group of unmotivated sidekicks to echo his presence without contributing meaningfully to the storyline.Director Murugdas, known for his exceptional storytelling and memorable films, has delivered yet another project that disappoints. The screenplay is undermined by a weak narrative and underdeveloped characters, reducing what could have been an engaging story to a series of predictable and uninspired scenes. The film's reliance on a mix of South Indian and Hindi actors does little to hide the fact that even the talented Sharman Joshi is wasted in a role that offers no challenge or depth.Furthermore, the dialogue lacks substance and fails to capture the audience's interest, while the action scenes are choreographed without creativity, making them appear unrealistic and dull. Salman's performance, marked by a noticeable disinterest in both acting and fight choreography, reinforces the impression that the movie was made with minimal effort. In an interview, he even admitted that his mere presence on screen is enough to guarantee box-office numbers, which not only diminishes the value of the storyline but also undermines the hard work of other talented actors.Adding to the disappointment, Amir's decision to leave the role-later filled by Ravi Kishan, who delivered a commendable performance in Lapata Ladies-further highlights the miscasting and poor casting choices. Had Amir retained the role, the film might have benefitted from a more compelling performance, rather than relying on Salman's diminishing appeal.In summary, Sikandar is a regrettable effort that not only squanders the potential of its story but also demonstrates a troubling trend of complacency. The lack of dedication in the script, the unenthusiastic direction, and the overall underperformance of key characters make this film a tedious watch. It is high time for Salman Khan to consider producing or mentoring projects that truly highlight the talents of the cast and crew, rather than relying on a formula that prioritizes star power over genuine storytelling.",

Mandana was cast as a lucky charm on account of her previous movies being hits. It was embarrassing to see an accomplished actor and beloved 3 idiots character Shraman Joshi reduced to just being a yes man in this movie. The fight scenes as usual were exaggerated and songs easily forgotten even before it finished. Basically, there are no endearing qualities about the movie that would drag me to watch it again.

Villain style don't carry intensity, serious nor threatening but shown forcibly & left him incomplete position without wrapping his storyline. Drama between hero and villain is not heavily translated. Despite movie does create emotional heartfelt scenes. But Salman speech, messaging & lecture doesn't land well instead of inspiring makes us boring. Visual color effects are captivating & eye catching. Structural connecting of plot, people & society looks repetitive overstuffed. Also runtime is long 2nd half felt over dragging. This could've cut made more emotional.

Throughout the 2h40min duration the film never picks up. The direction is not impressive plus the songs are also not chartbuster. This movie has a storyline which is already done to death in Bollywood but as a matter of fact even if the story is not gripping the direction should be extra-ordinary. I don't want to say this I liked SKs movies in the past like TERE NAAM, Bajrangi bhaijaan, Wanted and he acted really well in these movies but in this movie he is little laidback and seemed least interested and his dialogue delivery is terrible. His voice is monotonous in every scene. I'm not sure if it was a dubbing problem or what? But having said that if he would have performed better, this movie would have been watchable atleast. His acting is not up to the mark. I'm comparing this one to SRKs Jawaan. Even though Jawaan had an ordinary story but still because of SRKs performance in dual role took movie to the next level. Here SK was not convincing. Even though this role is made for him. He didn't performed well enough except some emotional scenes and action scenes. Rashmika is miscasted here definitely. This movie never picks up it's very slow, even Tiger 3 was better than this one.Please save your money and watch it on OTT.",

        "content": "The Accountant 2 continues the story of Christian Wolff, a highly skilled accountant who works with dangerous criminal organizations while dealing with his own secretive past. As a sequel to the 2016 film The Accountant, this movie expands on Wolff's world, blending action, drama, and character development. While the film works hard to improve upon the original, it succeeds in some areas and falls short in others.The plot of The Accountant 2 picks up after the events of the first film, with Wolff trying to lead a quieter life. However, he is pulled back into the dangerous world of crime when a new case comes his way. This time, the case is more personal, forcing him to confront both new enemies and aspects of his past that he had hoped to leave behind. The movie maintains a strong balance of action, suspense, and drama, but it is the emotional depth and the character-driven narrative that really stand out. The exploration of Wolff's past adds a layer of complexity, making the stakes feel more significant than in a typical action film.Ben Affleck returns to play Christian Wolff, delivering a strong and nuanced performance. He skillfully portrays a character that is both cold and calculating but also carries a deep emotional burden. His portrayal of Wolff's struggles, especially his difficulty with social interactions due to his autism, adds depth to the character and keeps the audience invested in his journey. While Affleck is the clear standout, the supporting cast also contributes solid performances, especially Anna Kendrick, who plays an important role in Wolff's life. However, some of the supporting characters feel a bit underdeveloped compared to Wolff's character, which leaves certain relationships feeling less impactful than they could have been.The action scenes in The Accountant 2 are intense and thrilling, maintaining the high-stakes tension that defined the first film. Wolff's skills are showcased in a series of well-choreographed fight sequences that add to the excitement. While the film doesn't rely on nonstop action, it strikes a good balance between moments of suspense and bursts of action, making the story feel grounded rather than purely focused on spectacle. Director Gavin O'Connor does a great job of keeping the film's pacing steady, allowing the plot to unfold naturally while also ensuring the action scenes are exciting and engaging.A key strength of The Accountant 2 is its exploration of themes like mental health, trauma, and personal identity. Wolff's character, who is portrayed as someone with autism, is given much more depth in this sequel. The film shows that individuals with disabilities can be complex and multidimensional, which is refreshing in a genre often dominated by one-dimensional action heroes. The movie also delves into Wolff's childhood and his strained relationship with his family, offering more context for his actions and his personal struggles. These emotional layers give the action scenes more meaning, as viewers can better understand why Wolff behaves the way he does.At around two hours, the film doesn't feel overly long, but there are moments when the pacing slows down, particularly during scenes that focus on character development. For some viewers, these slower moments might feel like a drag, especially if they are more interested in the action. However, for those who appreciate a deeper exploration of character, these moments offer important insights into Wolff's psyche. It's a balance that may not appeal to everyone, but it works well for those invested in the character's journey.Overall, The Accountant 2 is a solid sequel that builds on the strengths of the first film while adding new layers of complexity. The emotional depth, character development, and intense action make it an engaging watch. Ben Affleck's performance as Christian Wolff continues to impress, and the movie does a good job of expanding on his backstory and struggles. While the pacing can be slow at times, the film remains compelling due to its mix of action and emotional storytelling. For fans of the first film or anyone who enjoys character-driven action movies, The Accountant 2 is definitely worth watching.I would rate The Accountant 2 at 4 out of 5 stars. It's a strong sequel that improves upon the original in many ways, while still offering enough intrigue and action to keep viewers entertained. Even for those who haven't seen the first film, The Accountant 2 offers enough to stand on its own. The movie is a well-crafted blend of suspense, action, and emotional depth, making it a worthwhile experience.",

The movie leans into what made the first one work-calculated action, smart pacing, and a character who's not your typical action hero.

The character dynamics may even surpass the original. And there are just as many story threads that reach satisfying conclusions. You can tell they put effort and care into this sequel.The comedy, though?!?! There were some funny moments in the first one. But in the sequel, I laughed out loud so many times, to the point I would list \"comedy\" as a subgenre. And it's not \"insert joke here\"-type humor. It's organic to the story and characters.I would say I still like the original a tiny bit better, especially with the originality and overall story.

        "content": "Okay. \"The Accountant 2\" is one of the year's biggest surprises and one of 2025's best movies.First, it's funny that it took almost the entire time Ben Affleck spent playing Batman for this sequel to come out. I thought I'd mention that. Affleck reprises Christian Wolff as if 2016 happened yesterday. Wolff is a man of ingenuity and dry wit, which Affleck emulates with gravitas.It helps that this time, he teams up with his brother Brax, delightfully played by Jon Bernthal. Although they both play off each other incredibly well, Bernthal managed to outshine his brother pretty often. What can I say? He stole the show in the first installment and stole more of the spotlight here.Before moving on, I should mention how I feel about the prior entry into this franchise. I liked it, but it has confusing stuff that takes me out of it. Also, I don't think Anna Kendrick's character worked for its story. Would you believe me if I said that this nine-years-later sequel has none of the issues I had with the original? I'm blown away by how well Bill Dubuque's screenplay improves and enhances this universe. Even when thinking about a potential plot hole, by the end, I remember a detail from earlier that explains it away. Nothing here perplexed or took me out of the movie, as I was always invested and intrigued. Additionally, I laughed a lot, something I don't think I could say about the original. The first didn't include much humor, but this one has many comedic elements that unexpectedly worked.For the rest of the positives, a returning Gavin O'Connor did a solid directing job, and even though Affleck and Bernthal are the highlights, the rest of the cast performed nicely. The action was fantastic (I'd recommend seeing it in a Dolby Cinema), Seamus McGarvey's cinematography was exceptional, many outstanding scenes outside the action and comedy were present, and the 2-hour and 3-minute runtime didn't drag.\"The Accountant 2\" blew me away. There was the potential for it to be superior to its predecessor, but it went beyond that by making for a wildly fun time at the movies.Technically, the acting, directing, screenplay, and cinematography make the technical score a 10/10.The enjoyment score: I felt the first was an 8/10, but the contrast between that and this sequel's quality is vast in the best ways possible. 10/10! It's not a years-later sequel for the sake of making one. It's a years-later sequel made to expand an immersive world richly. If you're a fan of the original, I have no doubt you'll see this follow-up, but if not, give it a chance! For my money, it's a must-watch!",

That's just me and my imagination. It could be a complete action movie from start to finish.This was one of the best movies we've seen this year. Great character building off of the first movie. Has quite a few heart felt moments, some unexpected comedy, and a lot of action. The chemistry between the brothers seems genuine, not forced or acted.Glad they were able to get the same director and cast.A must see for 2025. Would see again in the theater.",

If you like the first one, you won't be disappointed!!!!They must've put a long time in developing the script to the movie as they did s great job on continuing in the story line from the first movie! I totally recommend this one! I truly hope there'll be a third movie and make this a franchise. It was so good, I think I will see it again as it was so good I thinki I will see it multiple times . The movie action was excellent add even though it was kinda long time wise, it went quickly.Great movie, go see it people!!",

        "content": "The Accountant 2 doubles down on the action and humor over the first film. It does however try to juggle too many subplots that are poorly connected, leading to a less coherent film and a lack of a singular, hateable villain.On the plus side, making Jon Bernthal a co-lead this time was incredibly smart. He and Affleck have great chemistry and Bernthal's Braxton is both a lethal threat and downright hilarious. This is easily his best role since The Punisher.Like the first film, action isn't the primary focus, with a lot of time spent on enjoyable character moments. But when the action does arrive, it really delivers. Depending on what the new Mission: Impossible has in store for us, the Juarez shootout in this film may go down as the best action sequence of the year.Again, I wish more of the character development had been focused on the villains, so we'd have a central antagonist who seems like a real threat. Instead we get several boring micro-villains.I also wish the writing and editing were working in better harmony to bring us a more coherent story.But all that said, Affleck and Bernthal have charm to spare, the final act is awesome, and this is a decent follow up to the admittedly better first film. 7/10.",

        "content": "7/10. The Accountant 2 serves as a worthy sequel. Leaning more into brotherly banter, tighter action, and plays into a lighter and humorous tone.The plot and character arcs, much like the first, leave a lot to be desired. The story isn't as convoluted as the first but still gets murky. The villains are one dimensional, generic, and quite forgettable. Sadly, Anna Kendrick doesn't return.The film heavily relies on bringing Jon Bernthal into a bigger role and it works. His strained relationship and funny lines with Affleck are the heart of the movie. Crazy stuff always happens when Bernthal and Affleck show up. Their actions scenes are fun to watch. They are brothers who are trying to get along and get past their messed up childhood trauma. This results in the humor being less dry; for better or worse.Ben Affleck again does a splendid job in his role as a Aspergers man with his different tics and mannerisms. He is smart, nerdy, and a killing machine. Yes, the Hollywood portrayal of Asperger's is kind of clich√© for the sake of the plot. Not all of us are genius computer hackers. Or killers for that matter. But the film did a respectable job with depicting the thinking, psyche, and social struggles on a personal level.I think Ben got the weirdness down well by being around Matt Damon for too long. Haha, just kidding Matt, you're great. In the one trillion chance you read this, please don't be mad.Thank you, Regal Cinemas, for showing this early on Tax Day. No, I didn't see this at a film festival but that would have been awesome. (Hint, hint). Ben Affleck awkwardly line dancing was very hilarious. Kudos to suggesting the band play a Metallica song.",

K. Simmons-Red One, the Spider_Man movies.This is a sequel to the 2016 film and pretty much has most of the original cast returning. Ben and Jon as brothers and Cynthia as a government official-all 3 from the first film-and Cynthia is now needing Ben's help. Daniella plays a woman who was trafficked with her family to Mexico by an illegal trafficking ring. Her husband is killed and her son taken from her but she escapes and makes it back to America. J. K. Plays Cynthia's former partner that is trying to help Daniella find her son. When his efforts fail, Cynthia enlists Ben, who calls on Jon to help him. Ben still has his idiosyncrasies, which makes for some comic moments between him and Jon-who just loves to get into fights and trouble in general-and other normal people they encounter.It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.Ben and Jon have great chemistry together and I hope they make more sequels.

        "content": "The Gorge is the kind of movie that hooks you in with a solid mystery-thriller-romance setup, only to fumble the ball when it matters most. The first half actually works. There's a strong intrigue surrounding the characters, the suspense feels tangible, and the slow-burn tension keeps you invested. The whole anticipation of their connection is arguably more engaging than the actual payoff, but it's still handled well enough. The creature designs are fantastic. The film has some nice visuals, too. There's this eerie atmosphere with rain, lightning, and fog that adds a lot to the mood. It also blends genres in an interesting way, blending horror, sci-fi, and thriller elements while keeping romance at its core. And yeah, you can see clear pulls from Aliens, Annihilation, and even fun little winks to Whiplash and The Queen's Gambit, which is a nice touch. But as the film starts revealing its cards, it gets increasingly clunky. Some of the plotting feels forced, and there's this overkill of familiar tropes that makes things predictable. The dialogue, which was already nothing special, really dries up in the second half, leaving a lot of moments feeling hollow.Anya Taylor-Joy, unsurprisingly, delivers. She's got that natural screen presence that makes any role more engaging. Miles Teller is decent, too, and their chemistry is okay but nothing extraordinary. The problem is, as soon as the mystery starts unraveling, the story just kind of deflates. There's a point where you can feel the movie losing its grip as if it doesn't know how to maintain the intrigue it worked so hard to build. The tension fades, the pacing gets sluggish, and by the time it reaches the ending, it's clear the film just doesn't stick the landing. The final moment is pretty bad. It's a shame because the movie had something going. It had cool ideas, solid visuals, and a unique mix of genres. But by the end, it's like watching a magic trick where the setup is great, but the reveal is just... disappointing. A solid start, a frustrating fall, and an ending that leaves you feeling like you sat through something that could've been a lot better.",

They've got great chemistry, and you actually care about their characters. Zach Dean's script is sharp-imaginative, funny, scary, and surprisingly emotional.And the score? Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross absolutely nailed it. It's moody and atmospheric when it needs to be, then kicks into rock 'n' roll at just the right moments. Some eerie choral stuff in there, too, which gives it a unique feel.Honestly, I wish this had hit theaters-it's the kind of movie that would've been even more fun on a big screen.

There's not much chemistry between the main protagonists; yet they violate every oath they took for this job in the first few minutes. Add the poorly written scenes, illogical actions by the principals, predictable mistakes that create the peril, etc etc etc. And you get the idea. Halfway through the \"climax\", I was on my phone, bored, waiting for it to end.

        "content": "I saw early ads for this and was really looking forward to it. The first half or so lived up to the hype.When filmmakers try to provide something for everyone - romance, action, horror and heroism - they often fail. This movie starts to come closer to succeeding than most, but then is hampered by a ridiculously weak second half full of tropes, lazy writing and a ridiculous ending.In the first half, we have two interesting characters, both loners, both smart, both talented, getting to know each other across a gorge that acts both as a physical barrier and a metaphor for the fear of getting close to another person. Full of charming moments - The Ramones, dancing, chess, poetry and old-school getting-to-know-each-other-slowly - the first half is promising. Both leads are beautiful and the camera lingers delightfully, but not too long. The characters seem to have personalities and brains.In the second half, as soon as the characters enter a big old bunker in the gorge and efforts are made to provide an explanation of what the gorge is and how it came to be, all of sudden it's like the writers go on strike. Instead of letting the story unfold, we are subjected to extensive and inexplicable mansplaining from Miles' character. Instead of storytelling, the screenwriters just run out of steam and have him suddenly and with no good reason do a lot of talking, Instead of showing what happened, the screenwriters just have Miles' character tell us. At length. It's no longer him and Drasa working together to figure it out. It's no longer the screenwriters showing the audience what happened through flashbacks or backstory or a slow discovery. It's just Miles inexplicably figuring it out and telling us. No curiosity, no buy-in, nothing interesting at all. Just very lazy writing.Was the film running over budget? Did the screenwriter have another project to work on? What happened? It has a final-season-of-Game-of-Thrones-tanking feel. Or like every single Katherine Hepburn Spencer Tracy movie complying with the Hays Code in which a great film gets ruined in the last ten minutes. And that final scene.... puh-leez! Our hero ends up dressed in white lace working as a waitress? For realzies? What were the writers thinking?Hopefully someday someone with better writing skills will redo this. It's not a bad concept, just poorly executed.Do yourself a favor - watch the first half. Then, as soon as Drasa walks into the bunker at the bottom of the wall in the gorge, make yourself turn it off and write your own ending.",

It takes about 30 minutes for the action to gear up, but once it does it delivers. There are noticeable lulls between the more exciting sequences, the pacing was a bit slow to me.

Above all, the movie didn't feel boring even after about two hours, and the acting wasn't bad either. Initially, I thought the movie would be a fantasy monster film or one with aliens, as the trailer mentioned a monster. However, this film is actually a sci-fi action romance based entirely on scientific conspiracy theories.That said, there were some parts in the middle where the plausibility was lacking, and the plot wasn't as meticulously crafted as it could have been, which made me lower my rating. Overall, though, it's still a movie worth watching.This kind of action-romance film usually brings to mind the old-fashioned notion of chivalry, where a man is expected to sacrifice himself unilaterally for a woman. However, in an era where both men and women enlist in the military regardless of gender, such clich√©s feel outdated and old-school. What makes this film truly moving is that both the man and the woman sincerely and coolly sacrifice for each other, overcoming hardships together.Last but not least, the idea of characters in a movie sharing love and hinting at the future through poetry and quotes really resonated with me, and it made me want to indulge in poetry again.

Very generic and dull.I wish they spent more time on developing a good second act. I love Ana Taylor joy and will watch anything with her in it but even that was tough to do given how the story plays out. I'd almost rather watch the first 30 minutes four times instead of the whole 2 hour movie. Mysteries sometimes are not that interesting. And in this case they are downright boring.",

After watching Captain America Brave New World last night, I realized that I had to change something that no one ever done is to change my mind set and turn the switch to Valentine Mode. I do enjoyed monster flicks films, the film it's more like a DMZ with operatives from two separate countries each watching their country's respective side. Cast Miles is alright in this and Anya. Weaver looks aged a lot. By not watching this trailer the movie in my expects is going to be good overall. 9/10 is not hard-core R-rated but is moderate for action horror love story. Happy Valentines Day. That was amazing movie, keep me intense scene by scene.",

Its emotional narrative, creating a world that feels both futuristic and deeply human. The technological elements are seamlessly woven into the plot, driving the story forward while enhancing the characters' struggles. The sci-fi twists are unexpected, adding layers of complexity to the romance.

It comes to Apple TV on February 14th and stars Anya Taylor Joy, Miles Teller, and Sigourney Weaver. It tells the story of two elite snipers who are sent to guard opposite sides of a mysterious gorge without knowing what is in the gorge. The first hour of the film was solid and enjoyable as we're introduced to the two leads and see how they're living their day-to-day lives in their outposts and eventually how they start to communicate and get to know each other. It's that first hour, with the solid introductions to the characters that helps this film hold up for me, because the second half of the story doesn't feel as strong. After that first hour, the two are suddenly thrust into survival mode as they battle unknown forces in an ominous setting. Eventually, they figure out what's going on and it doesn't really feel like anything new or super unique. We've all seen these types of situations in sci-fi/horror movies so it's unfortunate something that started off as strong as this film did ended up feeling a bit ... generic and predictable by the time it was over. I didn't hate it by any means. It was a fun way to pass two hours. But there's a part of me that had expected a bit more, so that was a scoch disappointing.

Got it.When she gets to the Gorge she starts smiling at Teller and wants to dance because it's her birthday. Puts on the Ramones and Bops around. I thought she was sad. Everything we saw about her up until now is sad. But now she dances. Makes no sense.Miles gets parachuted into the area. Lands on the ground. Then climbs up a mountain. Why on Earth would you not land on top? No explanation. I'll tell you why because they wanted to show him climbing up the mountain.He lands basically with the clothes on his back. Presumably she did too. Yet there's a fully stocked bunker. Every night monsters attack kind of like Dawn of the Dead. Thousands and thousands of rounds of ammunition are expended. Landmines. Hand grenades. Lots of heavy Hardware. Where did this stuff come from? The place has been running for a year without deliveries. In time we realize it's been running for 80 years without deliveries.There's no road. Nothing is parachuted in. Where does all the stuff come from? Every day he's out there repairing the fence with a welder torch. Putting up new land mines. Reloading the automatic turrets. Where does all this hardware come from?Hell where does the toilet paper come from?Are they supposed to wear the clothes that they came with everyday for a year?Anya has a uniform clearly tailored to her female form. Definitely not standard issue military dungarees. How did this clothing arrive at the place?During the movie hundreds of monsters are destroyed. Apparently this has been going on for 80 years. Eventually we find out that these are the initial guys from 80 years ago who have mutated because reasons.So these tree men have been living down there for 80 years and getting killed off hundreds at a time. So if we lose like a thousand a year then that would have been 80,000 men. But apparently only like 2400 went down initially. Makes no sense.None of it makes any sense. Anya is brooding and then she's flirtatious.The movie is a train wreck of logic. I didn't find any of it believable. A great deal of it didn't make any sense whatsoever.

It feels like the script was written by a teenage girl.Look -\nThey've hired attractive and curious people of different sexes, although they could have agreed to hire same-sex, unattractive and not looking for communication. They did not check their loyalty to the rules. They didn't explain to them what the point, awakening their curiosity (but if an incident happens, isn't it better if they are mentally prepared for it?) And they didn't control the actions of the hired weirdos.What could go wrong?In case of a bomb explosion or something else unforeseen, no bomb shelter was created, and for some reason the helicopter descended and flew straight down the gorge...\nBut there is love!Visually it is also poor. The picture is flat and dim, no light, no shadow.Once upon a time in the past, the visual part required a lot of effort, expense and time, but the stories were interesting and unique. Now, when the visual component is much easier and faster to make, and, it would seem, you can pay maximum attention to the script,.. the stories have become primitive, monotonous and empty.

While the stories are nowhere similar, the mix of sci-fi and romance are there and fairly entertaining, much better than half the stuff that makes it to actual cinemas these days. So for a TV movie, this is quality stuff!The story is told through a small cast of characters where, I feel, there was just enough background story to make the audience care about them. The situation the two leads are tossed into next is interesting and mysterious right from the get go. It then turns to the romantic/charming side of things just briefly before going straight back into sci-fi/action. In the end, the mystery is uncovered and everything gets tied up nicely into a bow.Sure, there's a TON of CGI, but it's nicely done and I was able to turn off my brain enough to accept it as reality for 2 hours. I have one lingering question around the enemies, but it's a small thing, so no plot holes you can drive a truck through. Go see it!",

The film starts off as a military thriller before becoming a silly rom-com before becoming a science-fiction action horror and ending by coming back to being a military thriller again. This multi-genre, tonal swapping throughout proved to be very distracting to me.Ultimately, this continuous meandering through genres is down to a poor script. Don't get me wrong, undoubtedly the USP for this film is an admittedly very good idea at the core - a gorge that soldiers need to guard to ensure that what's in it stays in it. But I found the story, despite it's uniqueness, to be very cliched in places, characters (especially Anya Taylor-Joy's) acting out of place of whom they were previously established as being, alongside the whole thing being peppered with unconvincing, very clunky and corny dialogue.On that note regarding the dialogue, lets talk about the delivery of said dialogue. The acting here by two heavy weights of the movie world feels flat, uninteresting and uncaring. I think half way through this production Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy just realised how silly a film they were in and decided to phone it in.The strongest part of this film is undeniably it's cracking idea of a premise - I just wish that the characters and story around that premise were better utilised. There's some solid action sequences and some not half-bad visual effects that I have to admit do make the film entertaining in parts but ultimately, in my opinion, the film isn't a recommendation from me.",

Can't say I buy into this \"love\", though, since it's mostly out of boredom rather than from some deep connection between the characters. The chess scene did not make much sense either, because if they are not supposed to make contact, why would both of the towers have chess sets? Doubt all the soldiers before were chess geeks and would play by themselves. Why are they forbidden contact, too? They do have same goal...\nThe second part is sci-fi. I would say it looks relatively good. Nothing particularly outstanding, but nothing damning as well. It is full of cliches. Which is not necessarily bad, but the movie just lack its own identity, in the end. I think if they \"mixed\" the 2 parts a bit more, and helped grow the \"love connection\" through some recurring danger it could have more impact.But again, not a bad movie, just do not expect too much of it.",

        "content": "The Gorge seemed to, in theory, have everything going for it. A solid director, great casting and a really intriguing premise. All of that though won't help the fact that any movie going straight to streaming is only going to get me so excited. It's not a very good script and the back half definitely isn't as strong as the initial set up but I did for the most part find The Gorge to be an enjoyable experience.Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller do really end up being the reason to see this film. Their chemistry is insane and the movie's at its best when we're seeing their interactions play out, even when they're not directly on screen together. You ship them straight away and, even if it was predicable in places, I was still very happy with how the central romance played out. It's a lot funnier than I expected it to be and the script does do a good job and building up the mystery of this gorge. I do think they revealed the nature of what's in the gorge too early however and it's when the film starts to answer the questions it's been building where things start to falter for me. The second half is basically a completely different movie and it's just where things started to feel a bit generic. The exposition is very lazy and it feels like Scott Derrickson is trying to play into his horror roots but to mixed results. The threats these characters face feel very copy and paste from other films and it ends up feeling quite drab visually. The CGI is weak and the most accurate way the I can describe the cinematography is that it looks like something designed directly for streaming. Thankfully the mystery ends up taking a back seat to the character interactions in the closing scenes and as cheesy as it was the ending did work for me.The Gorge is at its best when it lets these 2 character play of each other and while the mystery and horror elements don't always work I was always at least entertained. It's just unfortunate that the script does know how to answer its intriguing questions in a completely satisfying way. It's much better than most of the slop that goes straight to streaming and I thinks it's an easy film to recommend in spite of its flaws.",

Ironic, a review telling you to ignore the very thing they are doing.The Gorge is the kind of movie that hooks you in with a solid mystery-thriller-romance setup, only to fumble the ball when it matters most. The first half actually works. There's a strong intrigue surrounding the characters, the suspense feels tangible, and the slow-burn tension keeps you invested. The whole anticipation of their connection is arguably more engaging than the actual payoff, but it's still handled well enough. The creature designs are fantastic. The film has some nice visuals, too. There's this eerie atmosphere with rain, lightning, and fog that adds a lot to the mood. It also blends genres in an interesting way, blending horror, sci-fi, and thriller elements while keeping romance at its core. And yeah, you can see clear pulls from Aliens, Annihilation, and even fun little winks to Whiplash and The Queen's Gambit, which is a nice touch. But as the film starts revealing its cards, it gets increasingly clunky. Some of the plotting feels forced, and there's this overkill of familiar tropes that makes things predictable. The dialogue, which was already nothing special, really dries up in the second half, leaving a lot of moments feeling hollow.Anya Taylor-Joy, unsurprisingly, delivers. She's got that natural screen presence that makes any role more engaging. Miles Teller is decent, too, and their chemistry is okay but nothing extraordinary. The problem is, as soon as the mystery starts unraveling, the story just kind of deflates. There's a point where you can feel the movie losing its grip as if it doesn't know how to maintain the intrigue it worked so hard to build. The tension fades, the pacing gets sluggish, and by the time it reaches the ending, it's clear the film just doesn't stick the landing. The final moment is pretty bad. It's a shame because the movie had something going. It had cool ideas, solid visuals, and a unique mix of genres. But by the end, it's like watching a magic trick where the setup is great, but the reveal is just... disappointing. A solid start, a frustrating fall, and an ending that leaves you feeling like you sat through something that could've been a lot better.Review by VaibhavSinha5This review reflects my sentiments.",

        "title": "Should have been a special episode of Falcon and the Winter Soldier",
        "content": "The MCU is currently a mixed-bag of incredible and downright mediocre films with its Multiverse shenanigans. Captain America: Brave New World is a return to a more grounded, political thriller-style narrative, reminiscent of The Winter Soldier. While it doesn't quite match the tension and sharp storytelling of the original Captain America trilogy, there's enough intrigue to keep the plot moving.That said, the film plays things a little too safe, resulting in a familiar, by-the-numbers MCU entry that lacks the surprises fans may be hoping for.One of the more interesting aspects of the film is its unexpected role as a pseudo-sequel to 2008's The Incredible Hulk. Seeing familiar faces return after such a massive gap is a nice touch, but it also raises a potential issue: newer fans might feel lost when characters suddenly appear with little explanation. It's an unusual creative choice that rewards longtime viewers while potentially alienating others.Harrison Ford, stepping into the role of Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross, is easily one of the film's highlights. The man is a legend, and he carries his scenes with a commanding presence that proves why he's a pop culture icon. There's not a moment where he seems like he's phoning it in, and his performance adds a level of gravitas to the movie. On the other hand, Giancarlo Esposito, an actor who thrives in villainous roles, is criminally underutilized. His brief moments on screen are strong, but it's frustrating knowing how much more he could have brought to the table with a larger role.Anthony Mackie continues his journey as Captain America, and while he fully embodies the character's ideals, he doesn't quite have the larger-than-life presence needed to carry a major MCU film. This could be a matter of personal perception, but something about his performance feels more suited for television, making the film feel like an extended episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier rather than a proper cinematic leap. The themes of legacy and responsibility are appreciated, yet they don't hit with the impact they should.The action in this film is serviceable but ultimately underwhelming, especially when compared to the hard-hitting, minimal-cut, steady camerawork that the Russo brothers perfected in The Winter Soldier and Civil War. The fights here feel more generic, relying on quick cuts and shaky camera movements that dilute the impact of each sequence. It's not necessarily bad-it just doesn't leave a lasting impression, which is disappointing for a character whose best moments have been defined by grounded, brutal, and tactically impressive combat.Ultimately, Captain America: Brave New World feels like a film that would have thrived during the earlier phases of the MCU but struggles to stand out in the current era. There's something missing-perhaps the spectacle, perhaps the unexpected twists, or maybe it's just the overall sense that Marvel fatigue is setting in. Watching it feels a bit like sitting through a weaker episode of a great TV show-necessary for the overarching story, but not particularly exciting on its own.6 out of 10.",

Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson and Harrison Ford as Ross, both fails to capture the essence that made its predecessors compelling.Although Ford is better than the charismatic vaccum that is \"Do Better\" Cap.The narrative is a convoluted mess, attempting to juggle political intrigue with superhero action, but succeeding in neither.No tension, thrill, no excitement. The action felt tedious to follow.It's as if the writers threw together a series of tropes without any regard for coherence or originality.Mackie's portrayal of Sam Wilson lacks the charisma and gravitas needed for the mantle of Cap.His performance is wooden and uninspired, making it difficult to invest in his character's journey. Plus we have to act as if we care for his sidekick...the new falcon... didn't bother to learn his name.Ford, usually a powerhouse, seems disinterested and it's obvious he came to collect a paycheck. Plus why would you cast a 80 plus nearby to grave for a character that is properly re introduced.The film's pacing is atrocious, dragging in parts where it should be thrilling and rushing through moments that could have provided emotional resonance.The action sequences are uninspired, lacking the creativity and excitement that we expect.As usual the secondary or primary ( depends how you see it) antagonist is worthless whereas if used correctly he could have been a seriously dangerous threat. Earth's mightiest heroes the tv series had awesome portrayal of the character in a handful of episodes.The VFX is trash with several scenes appearing blatantly artificial. The cinematography is uninspired, failing to capture any memorable or striking imagery.Save your time and money; this is one superhero flick that's not worth the watch.",

There are a few weird cuts, a couple of nonsensical story-beats, very weird editing at times and an end credit scene which is just meh (only one btw). But movie-wise this is... almost okay, I would say.There are good ideas here, which has been lacking in Marvel recently so despite my score and critique I will praise the studio for at least trying something. Failed try, but a try nevertheless.The positives: this is decently entertaining, decently fun with good acting. I would rank this middle- to Low comes to Marvel movies, ahead of Black Widow, but worse than The Marvels... And, I think the music and sound design was great.With that said the movie also have a lot of negatives. The main problem is what they tried to do. They want this to be a 'Winter Soldier'-like movie, sprinkled with some Incredible Hulk sequel. But both of those movies are far better and so this movie's story does not hold up. I think they should have gone down a different road and let this movie be its own thing. Another issue is that the movie drags and have pacing issues, which is sort of weird since the movie is only about 1 hour and 40min of actual run-time (movie is 2hrs officially). I actually think this movie should have been 25min longer to make scenes breath a little. But due to pacing and content the movie almost becomes boring. Almost all of these problems is likely due to all the reshoots and re-writes we've heard about.There are sadly also more problems. The overuse of CG for one, especially since it is not always done well either. How come Iron Man and the early MCU movies still, to this day, have better computer graphics than today's Marvel? Don't Marvel care anymore?And who came up with the main opposition to US? Really? A vassal will fight their master and superpower? Yea, right. Also, who is that Israeli child? What was the point with her character?Overall though, as a movie, I give it a 3/10. In one month no one will ever care about this movie.Worth your money? Maybe. Some of you are likely to enjoy this movie, or at least more than I did but I will not recommend.",

But I decided to approach it as a straight-up action movie-and in that sense, it was okay. It was entertaining and somewhat enjoyable for what it was, but the movie had its fair share of flaws.The Story:\nThe plot felt rushed, and while it had some interesting connections to The Eternals, it lacked depth. There were noticeable editing issues, and the script felt average at best. The villains was forgettable, which is a huge missed opportunity because a hero is only as good as their villains. The Red Hulk storyline, which had so much potential, was underutilized and felt wasted.The Character.* Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America): Mackie carried the film and was a definite highlight. He's an underrated actor who did the best he could with the material he was given. His performance felt genuine, and he brought heart to the role.* Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres: A pleasant surprise! Ramirez played Joaquin Torres well and showed good chemistry with Mackie. I hope they continue building his character as Captain America's sidekick.* Harrison Ford (Thunderbolt Ross Red Hulk): Ford is a legend, but he looked uncomfortable in the role. At 83, it's understandable that such a physically demanding character might be tough to portray. If they plan to continue the Red Hulk storyline, they may need to consider a recast or a different approach to the character.* Shira Haas (Ruth Bat-Seraph): Haas is a okay actress, but she didn't feel like the right fit for this character. She gave it her all, but something about her performance felt off. Maybe it was the writing or direction, and it seems like she was trying way too hard to act tough, taking on men twice her size was not believable, but either way. The character didn't connect, it was a pointless character to have in the movie.The Action:The action scenes were not bad, with some well-choreographed fights and high-paced sequences that kept it fun. But the editing issues were hard to ignore, with some moments feeling choppy or out of place.The Missed Opportunities:\nThe biggest letdown was the Red Hulk storyline. They introduced such a powerful character but barely scratched the surface of his potential. Also, the villains lacked presence, which hurt the overall impact of the movie.Final Thoughts:\nCaptain America: Brave New World is worth watching when it comes out on streaming service, if you're looking for a okay action movie. Just don't expect anything groundbreaking from the story or villains. It's entertaining, but it feels rushed and underdeveloped. Hopefully, if they make a sequel, they'll slow down, tighten the script, and develop a stronger villain like MODOK or Zemo could be amazing if done right!Rating: 6/10 - Watch it for the action and Anthony Mackie's performance, but don't expect it to blow you away.",

        "content": "\"Captain America: Brave New World\" is a disappointing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, failing to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The film's plot is a convoluted mess, attempting to blend political intrigue with superhero action but succeeding in neither. The narrative is riddled with clich√©s and lacks any real depth or originality.Anthony Mackie's portrayal of Sam Wilson as the new Captain America is uninspired, offering little to no character development. His performance feels wooden, and the script does him no favors with its lackluster dialogue and forced humor. The chemistry between characters is virtually non-existent, making it difficult to invest in their relationships or motivations.The action sequences, a staple of Marvel films, are surprisingly dull and poorly choreographed. The CGI is subpar, with certain scenes appearing almost cartoonish. The film's pacing is erratic, dragging in parts where it should be thrilling and rushing through moments that could have provided emotional weight.Harrison Ford's role as President Thaddeus Ross is a rare bright spot, but even his seasoned performance can't salvage the film from its myriad flaws. The villains are forgettable, with motivations that are either unclear or utterly unconvincing.In summary, \"Captain America: Brave New World\" is a lackluster effort that fails to capture the spirit and excitement of earlier entries in the franchise. It's a film that feels more like a contractual obligation than a passionate storytelling endeavor. Marvel fans deserve better.",

        "content": "Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) seems to have found his footing with the moniker of Captain America, and created an intriguing fusion between the physical capabilities of the shield as well as Wilson's extensive experience with those wings. He has created a modern imagining of our favourite golden boy and he carries the weight of it well. This film isn't without its flaws, however I maintain an open mind as we are heralded into a new story for a new generation of the MCU.Wilson soon finds himself thrust into a world of controversy and political unrest as the new President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) attempts to control the nation with a War General's order, leading with intensive military intervention and action instead of stepping back to see the wider picture. His action, he believes, are his own, but it's soon apparent that a third party is responsible for bringing forth the near destruction of peace between nations.This film appears to be modelling itself after the 70s conspiracy thriller that set the tone for Cap's second film, The Winter Solider, and while this film begins in a solid place, it loses some serious steam mid second act, just following the realisation of the truth. The final fight sequence between Cap and the Red Hulk quickly fizzles out, and the bristling nerve of rage shrinks away just sharply as it appeared. The plot feels quite cohesive, if not a little mellow in comparison to the threat carried by previous villains seen in the MCU. I didn't really feel a lot of dangers surrounding our titular hero, even though tragedy does befall his prot√©g√©.Sam Wilson is an admiral hero, his struggles feel like our struggles and for a man who doesn't have the unshakable and undeniable abilities that Steve Rogers had, he sure does hold his own in a fight. This film doesn't rely on explosive fight sequences but instead has an accumulating storyline, which does feel whole, if not a little rocky. The idea of a new team of Avengers is also brought up early in the film, with Sam leading the possible new team, and while we may never feel the same energy as we did with the previous collection of beloved characters, it doesn't mean that a fresh collaboration are to be dismissed out of hand.Overall, I think this film has gained a lot unnecessary negative attention, and a large amount of it isn't really founded. Anthony Mackie leads in a strong performance, balancing all the elements of a complex character like Captain America, like the quiet resolution, strong emotional intelligence and the explosive energy and control in the power displayed during fight sequences. I hope to see him continue to play Cap with the sense of grounded nature that he has graced the character with.Bucky said it best in a well timed and placed cameo appearance to offer up some sage wisdom for a faltering hero, \"Steve gave them hope, you give them something to aspire to.\" (Paraphrased)",

        "content": "I had low expectations - after some of the recent MCU films, who wouldn't? - but this didn't even meet those. I enjoyed Falcon & Winter Soldier and this was an unworthy follow-up.The film had a lot of problems, but they were self-inflicted. Connecting back to 2008's Incredible Hulk and Eternals and F&WS and Infinity War/Endgame required a lot of weak exposition and this failed in making us care about the brought-back characters. Sam's main motivation was hit-us-over-the-head obvious but why he cared was barely apparent, relying too heavily on viewers recollections of F&WS. The film was so burdened with these callbacks that it lacked any sense of its own present day and what motivated Sam.I thought Anthony Mackie gave a solid performance but the screenplay didn't give him much light and shade to work with - in F&WS he shone when he got to be more playful. Harrison Ford's performance was awfully hammy and completely unconvincing as either a President or former general as was Shira Haas. She was completely miscast and under-developed in the film. This character combo made a good third of the film seem a bit silly at best. Giancarlo Esposito was unwritten and wasted and I have yet to understand what is meant to be interesting about Danny Ramirez's character, and this film didn't change that. To be fair, this all points to the biggest problems which were not the actors as such but the convoluted, unengaging plot and the crummy screenplay they had to try to sell. It was hard not to wonder if the kept adding extra characters to the film to try to make the story it work but if so this wasn't a successful strategy.Avoiding spoilers, the plot had a good kernel of an idea but the dramatic choices made failed at every step to translate this into a compelling story where there were clear stakes we cared about. Things moved at a good pace, but without any real drama or excitement along the way. The film failed to give us or the characters a real mystery, a twist, or any revelations - partly because the trailers had spoiled most of it. It was meant to be Cap unravelling a master puzzle by a shadowy genius but basically they fitted about four clues together and the villain kept explaining what he was doing the whole time. Again, without spoilers, by the end it seemed like there was a much, much simpler way for the villain to have accomplished his goal. His approach seemed pretty dumb.Last but not least, the dialogue writing was atrocious throughout the film. Dialogue that was meant to establish characters and relationships felt forced and attempts at humour fell consistently flat. Exposition abounded. And as the film progressed, characters were given cheesy homilies to deliver about what it all meant and what they'd learned in what were probably the cringiest MCU moments I can think of - the sort of guff the MCU has generally avoided wisely. Overall, it's aspirations to be a smart political thriller were dashed on the fact it's just not a very clever or convincing film. It certainly had nothing to new or deep to say about politics and in fact wasted a prime opportunity to send-up a certain intemperate President.On a technical note, the VFX were generally okay, but uninspiring. The flight sequences were well-executed. I found the Red Hulk VFX to be totally cartoonish and unconvincing though, which again undermined any attempt at this being a serious political thriller.I'd hoped to be pleasantly surprised but instead I'm pretty annoyed with Marvel for serving up another dud. How can they spend so much effort on something so unremarkable without realising and correcting? As with The Marvels, the end-credit scene was way more interesting than the rest of the film, but only by comparison. But their future promises are getting harder to believe.",

Let's get this over with.The performances were alright. Harrison Ford was definitely the standout in this film. I was expecting him to just phone it in, but he actually puts in the work. Not his best work, but enough to make me like his version of Thaddeus Ross. Anthony Mackie is great as always, but is honestly given very little. I'm not entirely sure Sam had a character arc outside of one scene late into the film and even that is just rehashing what happened in a D+ show. Giancarlo Esposito was absolutely wasted. Clearly added in later and could easily be cut.As for the plot, there's nothing new here I'm afraid. It feels like this film's only purpose was to introduce Adamantium to the MCU. The antagonist is terrible, they try to connect it to earlier MCU entries but no one is really going to remember. This film was clearly altered from what it originally was. It's difficult to talk about honestly, because it feels like there's nothing here. The film wants to be an espionage thriller like Winter Soldier, but lacks the tonal consistency, tight pacing and writing to even come close.But what about the action? It isn't great. The hand to hand combat looks sluggish and poorly edited. There's a good amount of that throughout. The CGI ranges from decent to downright terrible. It all rings hollow.So yeah, it's probably not the worst thing the MCU has put out, but it certainly isn't far above it. I can't bring myself to hate this film, because it is ultimately nothing.

        "content": "\"Captain America: Brave New World\" brought to life the best of the MCU. Most of the action sequences were sharp and the mystery and tension simmering. By far the greatest triumph of the movie was the heart it allowed its main characters to have and the relationships it built between them.It's grounded in hard truths without sacrificing that classic Cap optimism. Carl Lumbly and Danny Ramirez shine, but Anthony Mackie's infectious empathy is the true MVP of the movie. Harrison Ford is having so much fun and I had fun with him for sure, also the Red Hulk CGI was amazing. Some of the other visual effects could've been perfected, but it's nothing that throw me off. The movie brings an exciting idea for the future of the MCU under Sam Wilson as leader. A pretty solid Cap meets Hulk.On the mixed side of the things it seems that part of the movie exist to wrap up loose ends to \"The Incredible Hulk\" and \"Eternals\" and in doing so, the plot is becoming convoluted and you can feel where some of the reshoots were made.The Leader was a bit underdeveloped in my opinion, same goes for Esposito's chatacter and the dialog was a bit choppy at times. However I liked that this is ground-level MCU film. That's heavy on action and full of political intrigue and as a sequel to some previous movies I think it works.It's great to see Cap back in action. I can watch him sling that shield all day. This definitely feels like the beginning of the next chapter for Captain America, with the film laying groundwork for what's to come in the MCU.\"Captain America: Brave New World\" is an enjoyable watch with decent action sequences and some standout moments. It's nowhere near the overhated scores it gets right now. However, it didn't quite hit the emotional or narrative highs of the previous Cap movies, not that I compared them so much. Loved Mackie as Cap and I appreciated the more serious tone, but it did feel slightly empty at places.",

Considering the amount of reshoots, I didn't had high hopes for it and thought it wouldn't live up to the Captain America Trilogy and unfortunately I was right.Starting with the positives. The cast delivers some charismatic performances particularly Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Captain America. He pours his heart and soul into bringing the best out of his character. Danny Ramirez as Joaquin Torres also delivered a hilarious and delightful performance and his chemistry with Mackie is solid. And Harrison Ford as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross/\"The Red Hulk\" was one of the highlights of the film. The action sequences were entertaining even though not as mesmerising as they could've been.Now the movie has some obvious flaws. The plot felt rushed, predictable and lacked depth with a lot of story elements feeling underdeveloped. The pacing was extremely uneven. There were moments that felt rushed while others dragged on making the film a little unengaging at times. It tries to match the storytelling heights of the Captain America Trilogy only to fail at it. The editing is noticeably choppy. The CGI was questionable at times. The villain was underwhelming which shouldn't be the case with a Marvel movie. And the ending was anti-climactic.While it suffers from a rushed and predictable plot, boring villain and uneven pacing, Anthony Mackie's performance and the entertaining action sequences makes Captain America: Brave New World a passable action flick and another mixed bag in the Phase Five of the MCU.",

        "content": "Considering the fact that the Captain America films have produced two of the best MCU films in Winter Soldier and Civil War, it is a shame that we are now left with this thoroughly mediocre and lazy fourth instalment.Firstly, this film requires you to recall the events of a movie that came out in 2008. If you don't remember the events of this film, don't worry, as Brave New World is chock full of clunky exposition. It also requires you to remember the events of a show that came out in 2021. Without remembering some of these details, certain plot points just lose all their impact and don't carry much weight. Maybe my memory isn't what it used to be, and maybe I should have rewatched The Incredible Hulk and Falcon and the Winter Soldier before watching this, but who has the time for that.Even ignoring these links to previous MCU instalments, the whole plot still feels incredibly messy and all over the place. There is a random collection of new characters all of whom get zero character development. Even Sam Wilson, Cap himself, gets no real development or journey in this film. It's an incredibly bland portrayal of the character, which is a shame given the great journey Steve Rodgers had. Anthony Mackie and Sam Wilson deserves more from his solo projects. Once you muddle through the clumsy link back the Eternals, and the overarching plot that links to The Incredible Hulk, you are still left trying to grapple with other bizarre aspects of the film. Why was a character seemingly central to the story like Sidewinder only added in reshoots? They can spin as much yarn as they like about the reshoots not being material to the film, but they clearly weren't happy with what they had in the can when they finished principal photography and it shows. The plot also felt very fragmented and choppy. Somehow it managed to feel convoluted yet mindlessly simple at the same time. Quite the achievement.Now I will put my positive hat on briefly as there are some good points to this film. Despite being given very little to work with, Anthony Mackie puts in a good performance as Cap. It's clear that he could nail this role if the writing wasn't so poor, so I hope this improves for future outings. His chemistry with the new Falcon is pretty solid and there's some promise there. I do also think the final action scene is suitably chaotic, even if it does fizzle out, and the action throughout is all decent enough if nothing remarkable.Ultimately though I really do think that Marvel has just hit a brick wall. With each film that passes, it becomes more and more apparent that Endgame was the obvious end point. The franchise should have taken a hiatus then kicked off again with a whole new cast and a whole new set of stories. It's a shame as Mackie has been let down by a poor film and poor overall franchise direction, but for Marvel diehards this film will be watchable enough.",

While superhero films often tread a fine line between spectacle and substance, this installment feels more like a formulaic soap opera than a groundbreaking narrative.The plot is disappointingly straightforward, offering little that audiences haven't seen before. Viewers can anticipate the story's twists and turns without much effort, leading to a lack of genuine suspense or intrigue. The film's reliance on predictable tropes detracts from any emotional investment, leaving it feeling stale and uninspired.At the heart of the film is Captain America's struggle to balance personal relationships with a duty to the greater good. However, this central conflict often feels overshadowed by his incessant concern for an old friend. While loyalty is a commendable trait, the film presents this fixation as a self-indulgent distraction from more pressing global issues. In a world teetering on the brink of chaos, Captain America's preoccupation with personal matters comes across as trivial and misguided.Anthony Mackie, stepping into the iconic role, carries a significant burden as he attempts to fill the shoes of his predecessor. While he has a unique charisma that shines through, there are moments where he seems to be trying too hard to emulate Chris Evans' portrayal. This effort sometimes results in a performance that feels less natural, as if he's struggling to find his footing in a role that demands both gravitas and authenticity.Despite these shortcomings, there are glimmers of potential. Mackie's charisma brings a fresh perspective to the character, and his attempts to navigate the pressures of heroism are relatable. However, the overall execution leaves much to be desired, with a narrative that fails to capitalize on its characters' complexities.In conclusion, Captain America: Brave New World is a missed opportunity. It teeters on the edge of meaningful storytelling but ultimately succumbs to predictability and clich√©s. While the film might entertain fans of the franchise, it lacks the depth and originality necessary to leave a lasting impression. The journey of Captain America deserves more than a formulaic plot; it deserves a narrative that challenges its hero and resonates with its audience on a deeper level.",

It had horrible pacing. It was slow! It was boring the first hour, just blah blah tease some villain that no one calls by the comic book name \"the Leader\", it's a story that could've been shot in 5 minutes. It had to be reminded to us who this guy was since the end scene of Incredible Hulk (2008)\n, and Marvel finally decided to use him wrongly for 2 long hours of this clusterfyack. It felt dragged, I heard the word \"Cap\" 100 times through this film, more than they called Steve Cap in his movies actually, like they wanted so hard to prove something ppl cant even relate to. So Cap wasn't Cap. Didn't felt like Steve at all. Definitely not America's ass! When Bucky Barnes enters the scene for only 2 minutes it is better than 1 hour and 56 min of this entire film. They didn't made \"the Leader\" aka, Samuel Sterns as menacing and smart as the comics portray him to be. In the comics he controlles hundreds of people turning them into hulks, instead, this story felt very short and very boring. 5 minutes of red hulk did felt very short. Like i said they coulda told this \"marvelous\" story in 5 minutes, in another better marvel movie, but they stretched it so much and became really underwhelming towards the end. There's no payoff after the fight scene with the red hulk, no ace under the sleeve from Samuel Sterns aka \"The Leader\" which again they left that part out. This film used the Leader extremely poorly. And I do regret paying for this film almost 20 dollars. It ain't worth it whatsoever better to wait until it comes on Disney +.. I'll say that again! You've been tricked yet again by Marvel.",

Unfortunately, the fault is that the narrative, uninteresting characters, and uninspired approach doesn't really take any form of creativity to the top, rather it plays safe, mediocre and dull at it's finest. I don't hate the MCU because I have really enjoyed some of their works in the past, but unfortunately, they seem very lost.Each of the narrative structure, action style, character personalities, and direction were uninteresting, bland and uninspired. As if almost, it is a product rather then someone who genuinely loves the MCU or is interested in it.Harrison Ford is the best aspect as he does add some decent layers into the movie. But otherwise, I don't have much else to say. The same issues I have with the previous MCU films, they are still here.I think I'm done with the MCU for now.",

        "content": "If you're a film buff and a fan of superheroes, you would know that there was a lot of talk about poor test screenings and reshoots after reshoots. If you're a casual film fan, you probably won't know that this film went through so many reshoots, but I think after watching it, you can kind of tell.Look, I admire that Disney and Marvel Studios spent money probably knowing that they won't maximize on their profits to \"fix\" the film. Inside stories and scoops aren't always true, but where there's smoke, there's fire and I do believe in the somewhat troubled, behind the scenes production stories that were reported. I mention this cause again, you can feel the reshoots and the choppy storytelling. However, compared to THE MARVELS though, it's not as sloppy, it's just stitched up a bit better.Anthony Mackie carries the movie as best as he can, unfortunately he's given lackluster material (at least the first half) and lame dialogue. However his performance does carry a noble and heroic weight for the film. You don't get to see his chops shine until the second half, which I suspect wasn't completely re-done. The first half is where it feels awkward where I think the reshoots were added.Harrison Ford is quite good, replacing William Hurt who passed away (RIP). Red-Hulk was the most intriguing part of the film and what I looked forward too the most as I'm a Hulk fan. I miss savage Hulk, so seeing a Hulk literally Hulk-out and smash gave me what I longed for, unfortunately though it's only at the end. The marketing of the film leaned into the Red-Hulk, and I get why, it was to obviously create hype and excitement, but when you lean into showcasing the character the way that it does in the marketing, then I expect at least one more set piece with Ford's Red-Hulk, so it's kind of disappointing that it's just the third act. I don't know if I can ever forgive what the MCU did to Ruffalo's Hulk post INFINITY WAR. I'm hoping Ruffalo's Hulk will eventually revert back to his savage state and actually fight more Hulk villains. Anyways, Ford actually gives his full commitment to his role here, even if this was just a paycheck gig for him.Speaking of Hulk, Samuel Sterns returns. Tim Blake Nelson after 17 years is back and I liked it. Many will probably find the execution poor, and I wouldn't blame them, but seeing The Leader pushed my comic-book buttons because again, I'm a Hulk fan and I want to see more gamma powered beings. I akin his appearance to Arnim Zola from 2014's WINTER SOLDIER. Despite the grounded and serious feel (which I always appreciate), you can add something a little whacky and find a way to make it work. Plus I loved the visual design of character with the brain growing outward, along with his glowing green eyes. The promotional art showed a completely different type of design and look with a larger head and no skin deformity, so that makes me curious if this final look was also apart of the reshoots too.Can't speak much on the other supporting cast. They're fine nothing spectacular. Most of them were just passing through like Giancarlo Esposito (who was a reshoot addition) or just weren't as memorable. Action is actually pretty cool, some VFX is decent, but some are definitely a miss, especially some green screen stuff which I think were also apart of the reshoots. If you've seen the film you know what I mean.Adamantium is the MacGuffin that will also absolutely play a part down the line at some point. Loose ends of Norton's INCREDIBLE HULK and ETERNALS get wrapped up and in doing so it can feel convoluted as a semi-sequel to those films.While CAPTAIN AMERICA: BRAVE NEW WORLD wasn't going to match the previous Cap films's sharp storytelling, there's enough intrigue despite it feeling kinda hollow. The film is just okay, and deservingly belongs in the middle of the pack. Low expectations definitely helped, and if you're like me, a huge Hulk fan and have longed to see more Hulk related characters outside of Tim Roth's Abomination, then seeing Ford's Red-Hulk and Nelson's Leader will tickle you. It's really because of those two I bumped up the score.6/10.",

He struggled. It was like watching a regular action movie, SOMETHING I DON'T COME TO MARVEL OR TO A CAPTAIN AMERICA MOVIE FOR!There was no gravity to the story.

Yes, the second MCU movie ever released from way in 2008.It's truly a shame William Hurt passed away, especially for this movie which would have given him a great character arc. Harrison Ford was a good replacement, but his age hampers him a bit and Hurt had a wider range in my opinion. Still, it was fun seeing Harrison Ford doing his thing and he is still a good actor and got me in the emotional scenes.The movie also really continues Sam Wilson's internal struggle from the lackluster series well: who is he fighting for, what kind of Captain America is he and what does the mantle of Captain America mean?In conclusion, a great MCU film with different layers, a slower pacing that allows for tension and character arcs and a great cohesion with different previous MCU projects.

You've got Sam Wilson's personal journey to still carry the weight of being Captain America to keep getting back up after being knocked down. You've got President Ross who is try to make good by his daughter (though this could have been done more strongly in the movie IMO), and you've got the villain who wants his independence and some of his old life back (though that is a tired trope). In any case, the writers, director, and Anthony Mackie do best with his part, and it makes for a great movie.

Samuel Sterns could have been handled much better too. In short, I didn't enjoy it.",

Alas it didn't happen so Captain America/Falcon beating red hulk in a fight with no powers seems disproportionate to previous story lines.I was disappointed, doesn't hold a candle to previous films, they need to keep the big characters, get them in the cameos, these continued cameos are a big part of what makes the marvel movies so great.I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, my lowest score for a marvel movie. The Marvels was apparently a flop but I thought it was a lot better than this, maybe Anthony Mackie is better in a supporting role too.",

The action scenes were a mix of interesting and not surprising.Red hulk felt underutilised. From what I have seen on Youtube, he was capable of more.

This was a good outing for Marvel IMO and I hope this leads to a new trilogy with Mackie at the helm.SPOILERS.I found the fight choreography to be good. Watching the Shield ricochete between objects was definitively Captain America. While the CGI has some bad moments we can't let it distract from the good moments. Sam was a good protagonist and Ross was also well portrayed. And while Joaquin Torres didn't have much in the way of development he was still an enjoyable side character. Some Cameos such as Giancarlo Esposito fell flat, Bucky's appearance was delightful.Go into this movie for enjoyment and don't be searching every frame for flaws and you'll have a good time.",

This movie cut out a lot. A lot of reshoots nearing release. The lack of Captain America villains. The main antagonist being the Leader is a problem. The fact that the Incredible Hulk story-arc is being followed up here, rather than in a Hulk predominantly-focused show/film/anything is a problem. The cutting of the Serpent Squad/Society with only Sidewinder remaining (with no accurate, goofy costume), doesn't bode well. The underutilizing of Cap's own Rogues' gallery is a problem. Sabra. Is another one as well. The repeated negative screen tests. It's not landing in multiple iterations. Something's up. All in all, I did enjoyed the action overall but if this movie does not do well the MCU might be screwed. 5.7/10.",

It's food, but I didn't love eating it.Credit where it's due, Den 2 is shot well and sounds great. Better than the first. Some nifty heist hijinks were clever.But the lazy writing, plot conveniences, flat characters, meaningless subplots, insufferable music score (near the end), and shoddy pacing sully much of the positives.The first Den displayed constant tension as the cops brushed shoulders with the crooks in everyday situations, suspicion ever present. Here, there's hardly any friction, and when it's there, it's contrived.And at the end of the day, I'd rather watch Ghost Protocol or Italian Job than a shallow, underwhelming imitation.",

In this one we have only Donnie and Nick and some generic stand ins who we don't know or get to know, so we don't care for them at all.The action scenes in part 1 were phenomenal and well shot and acted. In this one they were sloppy and felt forced. Especially at the end of the car chase, truly after an all night drive to escape and THAT'S where they meet up with what's his face.... sure, that wasn't immensely convenient...The heist itself wasn't terrible, it felt real enough with a few minor issues.A staffing of 6 or so guards for the world diamond exchange.... 2 guys to clear the whole building???? They didn't even have radios when clearing ffs.During the escape chase, the entire city of Nice is practicially empty because.... just because.Ad placement takes on a whole new level of idiocy in most newer movies, this time Porsche (Volkswagen group) and Audi were the focus.The ending also not very convincing, Nick does what he does and then just passes on this info that isn't even helpful... \"sit back left\" not a single shot fired and \"back left\" isn't actually a seat position, rear passenger or driver side is. Back left depends on your orientation.Had anyone else delivered the info though it would've made more sense.",

The original is an instant classic that no one knows about, so Pantera has a lot to live up to. It mostly delivers, with Butler and Jackson renewing their special game of chess. Supporting roles are also solid, with Evin Ahmad a sexy standout. Action is less visceral this time, but Pantera's quiet intensity makes up for it, especially during the mostly silent heist scene. The thing that keeps Pantera from joining its brother as one of the best heist/action movies of all time is its last 10 minutes. There's at least three endings here, and while I love a good twist, the ending might make you scratch your head. That won't matter to some, who have been desiring a reality palette cleanse after too many watchings of Wicked and Mufasa. Eve. With its flaws, Pantera is a perfect scratch for that itch, and it comes highly recommended.",

This movie has the super model woman and the multi national crew, it's just lame, nobody is real.Donnie has a French accent now, and he totally pulls it off!!! Lol...Worst of all, they completely neuter Big Nick. Gerard Butler is awesome and he kills it as Big Nick in the first one. He has so much swagger. This movie, he does the best with the what he's given (he is the only reason I ponied up 2 stars instead of 1) but the script doesn't give him any cool moments to run with. Like remember his entrance in the first? Eating donuts from a blood stained box in the middle of a crime scene? It was awesome. Funny, but still gets across that he doesn't give a duck.What about in the first heist in the original? It gets across that the crew is trained, tactically sound, and has a moral code they attempt to abide by. This movie, just tries to make them look cool and flashy, no substance.I knew I was in for a disappointment when the screen told us we were in Belgium... Immediately, it was a kick in the gut, they are taking the franchise in this garbage direction... Just watch, 4 movies from now Donnie and Nick will be stealing space crystals from a mining colony on an asteroid and racing to Mars in a rocket ship that looks like a Porsche or something.They just want to make a new Fast and Furious franchise...If you are an actual fan of the original, you will hate this one, save your money.",

        "content": "Den of Thieves 2: Pantera is an entertaining sequel that captures the essence of a high-stakes heist with a Grand Theft Auto mission feel. While it doesn't surpass its predecessor, it delivers solid action and suspense, keeping you on the edge of your seat. However, a few missteps in pacing and scope prevent it from reaching its full potential.What I Liked\n1. The Heist Execution: The film's innovative, detailed approach to planning and executing the heist was highlighted, offering nail-biting tension during the climax.2. Action Sequences: The gunfights and tactical moves were not just well-executed, they were pulse-pounding, keeping the adrenaline high and the audience fully engaged.3. Character Dynamics: Gerard Butler's cop character dipping into criminal waters added an intriguing dynamic, making the story more than just a heist. From the beginning, Oshea's character growth and commitment to his skills keep you invested in the characters.What I Didn't Like\n1. Overextended Scale: The international setting felt unnecessarily grand, losing the first film's intimate, gritty charm.2. Pacing Issues: The first half dragged significantly, making the 2-hour 20-minute runtime feel bloated.3. Predictable Twist: While the ending twist added intrigue, it was telegraphed too early, diminishing its impact.Final ThoughtsIf you enjoyed the first Den of Thieves, you'll likely appreciate this sequel for its thrilling heist and action-packed moments, but temper expectations. The film trades its predecessor's smaller, sharper focus for a grander yet less cohesive narrative.Recommendation: Watch it if you're in the mood for a fun, action-heavy heist movie. It's not groundbreaking, but it's worth a trip to the theater .Rating:\n3.5/5 or 7/10 or B-: An enjoyable sequel.",

It's dragging so much that I'm literally wondering why I didn't just wait for it to hit Prime or Netflix. That's the vibe right now.The first one was so much better. Like, it had energy, it had charm-it kept you on the edge of your seat. This? Nah. The heist isn't even doing what a good heist should do. You know how Ocean's 11 had you thinking, \"How are they gonna pull this off?\" or how Money Heist had that crazy tension where you were rooting for them even when things went sideways? This movie isn't giving me any of that. It's like they tried, but it just feels hollow.Honestly, I'd rather sit through Fast and Furious 20 at this point. At least with that, I know I'm getting some over-the-top action and ridiculous stunts that make me laugh. This? It's just kind of disappointing. I'm actually here typing this because I'd rather be doing something else than paying full attention to what's happening on screen. Lol.Anyway, if you're thinking about seeing this, don't rush.

After enjoying my re-watch of the first Den of Thieves (and not understanding why I hadn't been super impressed with it the first time), I was looking forward to this sequel. Big Nick returns in Den of Thieves 2: Pantera. The director of the first film, who also wrote it, returns to direct and write this one as well. This is a plus, as his talent for plotting and pacing held up for me here like it did in the first entry. This film is a tad longer than the first one and somehow manages to improve on what made the first one so good. Despite some minor issues with certain plotlines, I was not disappointed as a whole, and that made me happy. Video review to come shortly.",

It felt like the plot was dragging on with unnecessary scenes that didn't contribute much to the overall story. The dialogue was lackluster, and the characters felt underdeveloped, making it hard to connect with them or care about their journeys.Things only started to get interesting during the diamond heist, which happens almost two hours into the film. By that point, I was already losing hope that the movie would pick up. The heist itself was well-executed and provided a brief moment of excitement, but it came far too late to redeem the rest of the film. It's frustrating that the only real action was crammed into the final portion of the movie, leaving the majority of the runtime feeling dull and unengaging.The ending, in my opinion, was underwhelming and left a lot to be desired. It felt rushed and didn't provide a satisfying conclusion to the buildup from the heist. I walked away feeling disappointed and like I had wasted my time.Overall, I wouldn't recommend spending money to see this movie in theaters. It's not worth the ticket price or the time investment. If you're curious, wait until it's available to watch at home. At least then, you'll have the option to pause or skip through the slower parts.",

There was not nearly enough pressure put on the two leads. It had a great hook at the beginning, but then it dragged on trying to build character or story or ... so there it is, it just tried and never succeeded at being special. There is one scene where the film focuses on backstory and character. Just one, all jammed into one. It's noticeable.Acting ~ 6 ‚≠ê\nGerard is a long way off from Sparta here. His performance wasn't moving; it lacked emotion and nuance. The 2nd lead, O'Shea Jackson Jr., well how can I put this nicely ... was not as good as Gerard. There was no chemistry between the leads. It just was not there. They tried to add a romance sub-plot but that failed too. Enough said.Cinematography ~ 8 ‚≠ê\nThe cinematography was saved by the sweeping drone shots and the chase scene. It was good but not great. I think I'm being generous here. The landscape where this film was shot is breathtaking. They were smart to spend a lot of money on drone work. It's a pretty film, but nothing spectacular.Some Commentary\nI was excited to see this movie, mainly because of the trailer-it's got a killer trailer. While in the theater, I kept hope, saying to myself, okay now it is going to ramp up and change for the better, but it plateaued and never did. The gravy never thickened.There's a formula in Hollywood that big studios use. It goes something like (Name Actors + cool stunts + marketing = box office). There are of course numbers and multiples attached to this equation. This movie felt like it was plugged into the equation and shown to be profitable, then green-lit.My Advice\nWait and see it on Prime Video. It's still fun, but not theater fun. Or, go watch it and let me know in the comments if you agree or disagree. Until next time.",

We don't know why Nice Cube is doing what he's doing - because reasons - and the supporting cast of villains are utterly forgettable east European swarthy heavies. You honestly struggle to remember who is who and you care even less. This is especially egregious given how well drawn the characters in the first film were. Everybody looks bored and confused here. Like the audience.There are some unforgivable macguffins - people appearing out of nowhere to save the day who couldn't possibly have known where the characters were going to be at that point in the film because they just crashed after a long car chase in the middle of nowhere. I can't believe we waited seven years for this. It's a forgettable, muddled B movie at best and considering it's the same talent behind the film as the first one that's really a massively wasted opportunity. I wouldn't normally say this but they should have just done a similar plot to the first one. That would have been much better.",

Unlike the 2023 Plane (Also starring Gerry Butler) and last year's Godzilla Minus One, this is not the welcome surprise as those movies, but it kind of works if you squint really hard.Gerry Butler plays the same character as the first movie, a federal cop who isn't above breaking the law and threatening innocent people with murder in pursuit of his man. Butler also makes some odd choices in this movie. He's doing less of a Gerry Butler thing and more of a Fatman from Jake and the Fatman. Slurping and snorting and smacking his lips throughout the entire movie. He even makes smoking cigarette sound like a glutton who is bathing in a tub full of leftover and slimey spaghetti. Butler plays the American Idiot in Europe to a one. Ostentatiously miss pronouncing croissant like only a fake American could.And then there is poor O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube Jr). Cube2 is supposed to playing an American gangster who is supposed to be posing as an African/French diamond smuggler, he clearly doesn't speak a word of French and his Pan-Mediterranean/Pan-North African accent comes and goes like a fart in a car.At the end of the day the action scenes pay off, so there's that.

        "content": "Den of Thieves: Panthera is an exceptional sequel that surpasses its predecessor in every way. This action-packed thriller combines intense heist sequences, international intrigue, and top-tier performances to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.Gerard Butler once again shines as \"Big Nick\" O'Brien, delivering a performance that is gritty, raw, and full of depth. His commanding screen presence anchors the film, while O'Shea Jackson Jr. Impresses as Donnie Wilson, whose character evolution adds fresh layers to the story. The chemistry between the two leads is compelling, with their uneasy alliance driving much of the film's tension.The action is relentless and flawlessly executed, featuring high-stakes shootouts, precision-planned heists, and breathtaking chases. The addition of a cunning new villain, Panthera, raises the stakes and keeps viewers guessing until the very end.With stunning cinematography and sharp writing, Den of Thieves: Panthera is more than just an action movie-it's a masterfully crafted thriller that will leave audiences talking long after the credits roll. A must-watch for fans of the genre!",

        "content": "There is good and bad with this film, even as it feels like it is missing some of the magic of the first.The cinematography, sound, and music are great. The film looks and sounds slick and flows well.The story has some complexity to it as it involves more than just a set of good guys and a set of bad guys. It also follows the first film plot-wise, so having seen it will add to the experience.At a few points in the story it would be better to not ask too many questions, as there are some plot conveniences that might be considered questionable for the validity and believability of a major international organized crime scenario. Some of the foundational premises of how characters are placed into the story are also tenuous.The highlight for me though, was the heist execution and the subsequent chase. A long and gripping sequence of events that takes up much of the last half of the film. Superb sequences with sustained tension and realism. Really well directed and scored. And a very cool helicopter intervention.The acting overall I would call very so-so. Often poor. The improvisation obvious. The casting, generally terrible. Adsurdly so. Aside from the two lead actors, I found the rest of the characters and cast playing them to be both unattractive and instantly forgettable. I never knew that French women had such large noses. Even the star of the film, and really the only one more or less acting in it, looks so haggard as to be a bit of a let down. The co-star was unconvincing generally in his role; he did not fit the part.I think that this is what differentiates the feel of this film from the first. The first film had tight bands of opposing forces with strong main protagonist and antagonist characters. It also had believable and well-defined entourage characters played by actors who could act. The intensity felt genuine. This film sorely lacks all of this. It went full Euro and feels sloppy because of it. Casting was over-the-top diverse to the point of distraction, resulting in a lack of cohesion, with too many weak characters with no charisma that only made the plot contrivances more obvious.Overall, still a good watch for fans of the first film.",

The other actors certainly aint bad at all, but they sure arent A-list material either. (this is only a minor criticism though).The good: when this movie finally get's going in the second half it is a real joy to watch these criminals excecute this smart heist with an enjoyable chase and shootouts that follows and with a surprising ending.Beware Americans who are not used to subtitles, this movie contains several European languages which must be subtitled or synced to English.

        "title": "Solid sequel to a franchise with potential",
        "content": "Back in 2018, a movie came out called DEN OF THIEVES, a fun action movie that's apparently a lot like HEAT. Starring Gerard Butler as a cop that sometimes crosses lines, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. As a thief who doesn't kill, I had a lot of fun with it. The weird part is, I just watched it recently on Netflix. I don't even remember the movie coming out. It feels like it was definitely underrated at the time. Well now 7 years later, we finally have a sequel, DEN OF THIEVES 2: PANTERA. Nicholas \"Big Nick\" O'Brian (Gerard Butler) is still on the hunt for Donnie Willson (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), who is now embroiled with the Panther Crew in the beautifully nice city Nice, France. After a slipup, Nick finds Donnie and instead of arresting him, he joins Donnie and his crew for their next heist, the steal diamonds from the World Diamond Centre. First, the trailers for this are a little misleading. They make it seem like an action movie like the first when in reality it's a highly stressful and entertaining heist movie where you never know where people's loyalties lie. Writer and director Christian Gudegast is back for this one. I appreciate the fact that he doesn't simply amp up the action and craziness like most sequels do. There is a LOT of planning and details before the heist in this one, where some people might get bored with. A positive aspect this brings is more character moments. What makes this work better than people think is the chemistry between Butler and Jackson. This might sound weird, but their dynamic reminds me of Batman and Joker. They need each other. Cops need criminals to chase. The side characters are more forgettable in this one, other than Jovanna (Evin Ahmad) the leader of the Panther Crew. This movie is surprisingly grounded and doesn't get too unbelievable except for a couple moments. I was surprised to find out that Butler had a torn ACL the entire time they filmed this. He really puts in the work. It's also the second January in a row where he's had a surprisingly good movie release, with last year's PLANE. DEN OF THIEVES 2: PANTERA is a very solid heist movie that's almost as good as the original. It's a little slow to get going and a little long, but I recommend it. I can smell a franchise on the horizon.",

They accomplished that by increasing human error factor, cutting out the not needed music in certain scenes, and making an overall simple 3 part plan of attack. (jump the roof, get down through the elevator shaft, crack the lock of the vault). There were no super athletes, martial artist and such, just a depiction of thieves.Overall I think older international audience will like this movie more than most teen marvel fans. Cheers.",

The first one is an amazing movie where you can see both sides of a major heist; you have the robbers who are all amazing, such great well defined group with a great leader; and then the cops, who are also really tough and with the amazing Gerard Butler, leading them. They have three encounters which keep adding to the final encounter which is one of the most amazing shootouts in movies ever. Amazing, extremely entertaining and so fun.And then, this second one, where the only connection are the main characters but the movie feels like it was something else entirely. No groups are well defined or interesting; the plot is boring and extremely stupid; everything is super illogical and they get away with everything; the editing is horrible and you can't understand several things; the ending suuuuuuuuuucks so much, and adding the M83 song feels so misplaced and stupid and unnecessary; the movie lasts way too much and you can never feel the tension of the first one; the bank job is the worst, supposedly it was the most secure bank in Europe and it has the most stupid security in the world; and the Italian mafia (who Butler says are the worst) are so lame and even recruit Jackson in the end!!?!?Man, what a tragic sequel.

Not much action in this film at all, except after they leave the bank in a Porsche. Car chase was a little exciting.On one note that's worth mentioning, is the scene at the bar where Donny and Big Nick are high then get into some fights. Afterwards they both leave on motorized scooters high and crash into one another. That was a very funny scene. Other than that, I would not waste your time of over two hours watching this film that has no substance or worth. Sorry Gerard, this was not your better films at all.üò≠",

        "content": "Den of Thieves Pantera is the sequel to the first Den of Thieves film from 2018, which took place seven years later. This sequel was again directed and written by Christian Gudegast, who also directed the first film.Nicholas 'Big Nick' O Brien (Gerard Butler) is still pursuing criminal Donnie Wilson (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) in Europe. This time, Donnie is alone in the diamond trade and is trying to get his hands on a sought-after diamond. Many other diamond thieves are also after this diamond. Nicholas and Donnie must therefore try to trust other diamond thieves undercover, in order to eventually steal the diamond from a heavily guarded vault. However, this diamond hunt also brings the dangerous Pantera mafia after them.While the first Den of Thieves was a thief of the story of the film Heat, this sequel is also reminiscent of other criminal robbery films. Furthermore, as a viewer you also know more than the characters. Where the undercover agent and the criminal from the first part try to work together with new, different criminals, there is a mutual tension between these characters. They do not know who they can and cannot fully trust, but as a viewer you know this more or less. This way the tension is somewhat lost for you as a viewer.The final, secret vault robbery is entertaining for fans of criminal robbery films, but this robbery is not that special compared to other robbery scenes from other criminal robbery films. The build-up to the robbery has its entertaining moments, but it does take a bit long and is sometimes filled with unnecessary extra scenes. This only makes the film of almost two and a half hours last longer. After the vault robbery the film seems to be more or less finished, but still goes on unnecessarily longer. This way the film seems to have ended twice, but the story still goes on unnecessarily longer. Sometimes only with scenes that seem to serve more as a build-up for a possible third Den of Thieves film.Gerard Butler and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Have a good ying yang connection in the film where they try to work together among other, dangerous criminals. After seven years it would have been useful if you had also gotten some catchy background of the recurring characters and their last experience with each other. If you don't know the first part, or can't remember it well, you actually know little about the two. So you can care little about the two and then nothing at all about the other characters.",

Gerard is the cop and O'Shea is the criminal. Gerard tracks down O'Shea in France, where O'Shea is planning a new job. And not just a job, but the heist of a lifetime. O'Shea is going to hit the world's largest diamond exchange with the help of Evin, the brains of the group with all the connections needed for the job. The twist here is that when Gerard catches O'Shea, Gerard tells him that he wants to join him on the job. Gerard says he is tired of being broke and not getting any recognition for his police work-but mostly he needs the money. O'Shea doesn't believe him at first but soon changes his mind after testing Gerard-he does things that a cop would not do. So basically, you have former enemies now working together.

        "title": "Chhava (2025) - A Missed Opportunity to Honor History",
        "content": "I had high expectations for Chhava, but unfortunately, the film falls short in multiple ways.The narrative feels unbalanced, beginning and ending with Aurangzeb's perspective. The film highlights war scenes but lacks clarity on the purpose and stakes of these battles. Key historical events such as the Battle of Ramsej, the Heist of Burhanpur, the Battle of Goa, naval conflicts, and the aftermath of the execution at Tulapur are entirely missing. These crucial elements could have elevated the film to legendary status.Lack of Character DepthMany key figures remain underdeveloped, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them. Important warriors such as Santaji, Dhanaji and Hambirrao are either sidelined or not given their due recognition. This affects the emotional weight of the film, particularly in moments of sacrifice and valor.Historical Inaccuracies in the ClimaxThe depiction of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's capture and execution deviates significantly from historical records. In reality, his imprisonment was kept secret for over a month, yet in the film, the news spreads immediately, leading to a misleading portrayal of the Marathas' response.Additionally, the setting of his torture scene is historically inaccurate. Instead of being confined in secrecy, as recorded, the film depicts him tied under the open sun, which misrepresents the true events.Missed Cultural and Religious NuancesThe film repeatedly shows Aurangzeb's prayers being fulfilled while the prayers of Yesubai and other Marathas go unanswered. This narrative choice may come across as an unintentional imbalance, potentially altering the perception of historical events.Incomplete StorytellingThe bond between Kavi Kalash and Sambhaji Maharaj, an essential part of history, is underplayed. A powerful moment, where Kavi Kalash recited poetry highlighting Sambhaji Maharaj's unwavering spirit even in captivity, is omitted.Additionally, the aftermath of Sambhaji Maharaj's execution-which led to a fierce Maratha resurgence-deserved more emphasis. The contributions of legendary warriors like Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav, who later became instrumental in resisting Aurangzeb, are completely ignored.Unnecessary AdditionsThe inclusion of Aurangzeb's daughter feels out of place, as there is no significant historical evidence of her direct involvement in these events.Final VerdictDespite its grand scale and production value, Chhava misses the opportunity to properly showcase the bravery and sacrifice of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and his warriors. The film lacks historical accuracy, underdevelops key figures, and leaves out essential moments that could have made it a truly unforgettable epic.",

        "content": "Laxman Utekar's Chhaava focuses on the Battle of Burhanpur and its impact on the Maratha-Mughal war, rather than being a complete biopic of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. The first half of the film struggles with pacing, but the second half gains momentum, leading to an intense and emotionally charged climax. The confrontation between Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb, particularly the exchange between Vicky Kaushal and Vineet Kumar, stands out as one of the film's most powerful moments. The battle sequences are well-executed, but the background score by A. R. Rahman lacks the necessary intensity to match the spirit of the Marathas. The action scenes are largely effective, though some exaggerated stunts and editing choices take away from the realism. Despite this, the film excels in its cinematography, costume design, and CGI, successfully recreating the historical setting.The performances elevate the film. Vicky Kaushal delivers a commanding portrayal of Sambhaji Maharaj, capturing his strength, determination, and sacrifice, especially in the final moments. Akshaye Khanna leaves a strong impact as Aurangzeb, despite limited dialogue, while Rashmika Mandanna, though competent, feels miscast. Ashutosh Rana provides solid support, and Vineet Kumar stands out with his gripping screen presence. While the film has its shortcomings, it succeeds in honoring Sambhaji Maharaj's legacy, ensuring that his courage and sacrifice remain etched in the minds of the audience.",

Directed with precision and passion, the film immerses the audience in the valor, sacrifice, and indomitable spirit of one of India's greatest warriors.Story & ScreenplayThe film does a phenomenal job of portraying Sambhaji Maharaj's journey-from his childhood under the shadow of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to his struggles, battles, and ultimate sacrifice for Swarajya. The screenplay is gripping, maintaining a perfect balance between action, emotion, and historical depth. Each scene is crafted to evoke pride, patriotism, and respect for the great Maratha warrior.PerformancesThe lead actor delivers a career-defining performance, embodying the strength, intelligence, and resilience of Sambhaji Maharaj with unmatched dedication.

It was over-the-top, dramatic, and felt like propaganda rather than a genuine attempt to tell a story. The film's reliance on sensationalism and melodrama detracted from its overall impact.Lack of Authenticity:\nIf the filmmakers had stuck to presenting the facts in a more subtle and nuanced way, the movie might have been more effective. As it stands, the film's heavy-handed approach felt like a cheap attempt to win accolades.Rating:\nIn light of these observations, I give the movie 3 out of 10 stars.

The film definitely suffers from screenplay issues in its first half. It's the second half where the film picks up. The pre-climax battle and the violent yet emotional climax stand out, especially a particular scene starring Vicky and Vineet, and the to & fro between the kings.However, the music and score by A. R. Rahman felt like the weakest part of the film. It worked in parts but It didn't have the necessary energy to match the Maratha spirit in battle scenes, and in many places, the score was so out of sync that it distracted from the screen. Apart from Vicky Kaushal flying, the action is raw and good, but the editing makes it look awkward on-screen. The camerawork, coloring, and costume department deserve special mention. At the same time, the wide-location CGI work is subpar.It is actually the performances that make the film what it is. Vicky Kaushal roars as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.The climax sequence is particularly very well executed by Vicky. Akshaye Khanna does less talking but shines as Aurangzeb. Rashmika was good but felt miscast. Ashutosh Rana provides good support. Divya Dutta and Diana Penty have limited roles to offer. But the man who stands out in the supporting cast is Vineet Kumar, whose crucial dialogue delivery stays with you throughout. The rest of the supporting cast also does a good job. Overall, Chhaava is not something extraordinary and has its fair share of flaws, but it's the performances that make it a must-watch. The last 30-40 mins will definitely make you emotional and leave the theatre silent.OVERALL - 3.25/5.",

        "content": "I walked into Chhaava expecting a gripping historical drama, but what I got instead was a test of patience. This movie stretches every scene unnecessarily, dragging out moments that should have been quick and impactful. A simple 10-second shot is extended to 20 seconds, just for the sake of unnecessary cinematic angles that serve no purpose. Instead of immersing us in the story, the director seems more focused on slow-motion shots and dramatic pauses that kill the pacing.Now, let's talk about the absolute absurdity of the lion fight scene. Does the director even know what a lion looks like? Because the size proportions in this movie suggest otherwise. The protagonist's hand was somehow as big as the lion's jaw! It completely ruined the intensity of the scene-how are we supposed to take it seriously when the CGI makes it look like he's fighting an oversized dog?And then there's the issue of irrelevant side characters and pointless subplots. Rather than keeping the film focused, the story drags with unnecessary diversions that add nothing but confusion. It's as if they were trying to pad the runtime without any thought to storytelling.The final nail in the coffin? The complete lack of battle tactics. The fights are nothing but over-the-top, one-sided action sequences where the good guys dominate without a scratch. Where's the strategy? Where's the realism? Battles in history weren't won by just swinging swords blindly, but this movie makes it seem like they were. It's lazy filmmaking at best.I honestly don't understand how directors come up with this kind of nonsense. Do they not even attempt to stay connected to reality? Do they just assume the audience will accept anything as long as it looks \"grand\" on screen? Chhaava could have been a compelling historical epic, but instead, it's a frustrating mess of stretched-out scenes, bad CGI, unnecessary subplots, and unrealistic battles. An absolute disappointment.",

        "content": "The film also does a brilliant job of portraying the Maratha Empire as more than just a military power. It delves into the cultural, spiritual, and philosophical foundations that made the Marathas such a formidable force. The scenes where Sambhaji Maharaj interacts with scholars, poets, and advisors show a different side of him-a man who valued intellect as much as strength. These moments provide a refreshing break from the intense battle sequences and add layers to his character. Absolutely outstanding movie I have ever seen in my whole life. I really love this phenomenal movie. Highly recommended.",

        "content": "As a history enthusiast and admirer of Maratha bravery, I had high expectations for Chhava, a film that promised to bring the incredible life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj to the big screen. While the movie does justice to his story in terms of content, the execution sadly falls short.The biggest letdown is the direction. A film of this magnitude needed a visionary approach, but the storytelling feels rushed and lacks emotional depth. Key historical moments that should have been grand and impactful end up feeling underwhelming due to poor pacing and weak scene transitions.Another major flaw is the cinematography and overall production quality. For a film that showcases one of the most powerful warrior kings in Indian history, the visuals fail to capture the grandeur and intensity of the era. The battle sequences lack realism, and the film's color grading and VFX work feel outdated and inconsistent. The attention to detail in costumes and sets is commendable, but it's overshadowed by the poor technical execution.",

        "content": "What sets Chhaava apart from other historical dramas is its ability to balance action with emotion. The battle sequences are breathtaking, choreographed with a raw intensity that captures the brutality of war. Yet, in between these epic clashes, the film finds moments of quiet reflection-conversations between father and son, a warrior's moments of doubt, and the sorrow of a leader making impossible choices. These moments give the film its heart, ensuring that it is not just about war and politics but also about the man behind the legend.so highly recommend to everyone to watch this best movie of this year.",

        "title": "Positive reviews are fake",
        "content": "Movie Review: ChaavvaChaavva is a perfect example of how action alone cannot carry a film. From start to finish, the movie is an incoherent mess, filled with repetitive fight sequences, weak storytelling, and poorly developed characters. The director clearly wanted to create a high-energy, action-packed film, but what we get instead is a frustrating and mindless spectacle that lacks substance, emotion, and engagement.Lack of Storytelling and Character DevelopmentOne of the biggest flaws of Chaavva is its complete disregard for storytelling. The movie jumps from one action scene to another without any real effort to build a narrative. There is no proper setup, no depth to the characters, and no emotional stakes that make the audience care. Instead of crafting a gripping story, the film simply throws us into random fights, expecting the action alone to hold our attention.Character development is nonexistent. The protagonist is nothing more than a one-dimensional figure who exists solely to fight. We never get to understand his motivations, background, or internal struggles. The supporting characters suffer even more, with barely any screen time or significance beyond being used as plot devices. The result is a movie where the audience feels completely disconnected from the characters, making it impossible to invest in what happens to them.Mindless Action Without ImpactAction sequences should serve a purpose, whether it's to drive the story forward, reveal character traits, or build tension. Unfortunately, Chaavva treats action as the only thing that matters, leading to a repetitive and tiresome experience. Instead of well-choreographed fights that feel earned, the film bombards the audience with over-the-top sequences that have no weight or impact. There is no suspense, no stakes-just endless brawls that quickly become exhausting rather than exciting.The problem isn't just the quantity of fight scenes but also their lack of originality. It's clear that the director attempted to mimic the high-energy action style of South Indian cinema, but the execution falls flat. Where South Indian films masterfully balance action with gripping storytelling, strong emotions, and memorable characters, Chaavva fails in every one of these areas. The action feels forced and disconnected, making it a poor imitation rather than a worthy tribute.Wasted Talent and Poor DirectionOne of the most disappointing aspects of Chaavva is the complete waste of talented actors. The film features a cast with proven skills, yet none of them are given anything meaningful to work with. It's frustrating to see good actors stuck in a film that does not utilize their abilities. Instead of giving them well-written roles, the director reduces them to mere placeholders in a chaotic mess of a movie.The director's lack of vision is evident throughout the film. There is no sense of pacing, no emotional depth, and no creative storytelling choices. Every scene feels rushed and thoughtless, as if the film was made just for the sake of having something on screen. A good director knows how to balance action with engaging storytelling, but Chaavva fails in every possible way.Final Verdict: Don't Waste Your TimeChaavva is a film that is best avoided. It lacks any redeeming qualities, offering nothing beyond mindless and repetitive action. The story is weak, the characters are shallow, and the direction is uninspired. If you're looking for a well-made action film, there are plenty of better options out there. Don't waste your time or money on this disaster.Rating: 1/10.",

        "content": "The battle sequences in Chhaava deserve special praise for their authenticity, choreography, and visual spectacle. Unlike many films where battles feel overly stylized or unrealistic, here they are raw, intense, and strategically executed. Every clash of swords, every tactical maneuver, and every war cry resonates with power and realism, making the audience feel as if they are right there on the battlefield. What makes these sequences even more impressive is how they highlight not just brute strength but also military intelligence and strategy. Sambhaji Maharaj was not just a warrior; he was a master tactician who understood the nuances of warfare, and the film does an incredible job of showcasing this. The camera work, the use of slow-motion in key moments, and the sound design all contribute to creating battles that are not just visually stunning but also emotionally charged.",

The war drums, the traditional Marathi instruments, and the rousing anthems make the battle scenes even more electrifying, while the softer, more melancholic pieces add depth to the moments of personal reflection and loss. A film like this requires music that is both grand and soulful, and Chhaava delivers exactly that. The way the music swells during key moments-whether it's Sambhaji Maharaj delivering a speech, charging into battle, or facing an emotional challenge-ensures that the audience feels every beat of the story. The songs, deeply rooted in Marathi culture, add another layer of authenticity, making the film a complete audio-visual treat.",

        "content": "Watched the big historical action release of Maddock CHAAVA directed by Laxman Utekar. The film stars Vicky Kaushal in the lead as Chatrapati Sambhaji and Akshaye Khanna as the ruthless Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and the film focusses on their clash.Sambhaji as an important historical character of Maharashtra and there are various shades and different topics discussed and debated on him. However his battle with the Mughal army and torcher and finally execution under orders of hardliner Aurangzeb is discussed lot.The film is supposed to be based on Shivaji Sawants popular novel Chaava and doesn't cover other aspects of Sambhaji's life,which we read in childhood in Amar Chitra Katha.The film is a big budget actioner based on history and has lots of dramatic sequences. The film's treatment of the subject is very clear and characters are either pure white or pure black. The film though based on real incidents also involves lot of larger than life frames and fiction too. To be honest I felt the writers and makers haven't been able to make the film very gripping. The film starts well and then loses pace and then picks up and then loses and so on. There is lot of action but barring the final battle ,I found the other fights quite unreal with loads of VFX. There are some scenes which are impactful and especially Vikki vs Akshaye get maximum attention.The film has huge hangover of Bajirao Mast Ani,Padmavati,Tanaji and Jodha Akbar but is not close to either of them in terms of impact and emotional feel. The pre climax of extreme violence and torcher though from history but was very uncomfortable to watch on big screen.Of the performances Ashutosh Rana and Vineet Singh leave a mark. Rashmika I felt was totally out of place. Akshaye Khanna as the uni dimensional maniac monarch Aurangzeb was menacing. Though he doesn't have much dialogues but his look as the old Alamgir makes him the big bad villain. The film belongs to Vikki Kaushal who again pumps life in a real character after Sardar Udham Singh and Sam Bahadur. He has worked hard on the film and honestly it's his hard work which lifts the film of the negative points.On the whole Chaava tries hard to be a patriotic historical actioner but works only in parts.",

        "content": "Movie Review: A Disappointing Attempt at Historical DramaThe film in question is partially inspired by a historical episode, but beyond that, it fails to leave a lasting impact. Despite its grand aspirations, the movie falls short in several critical areas, including storytelling, character depth, and originality. While historical dramas often offer a mix of spectacle and substance, this film struggles to maintain a compelling narrative, ultimately feeling like a tedious and exaggerated spectacle.One of the biggest drawbacks of the film is its weak and predictable storyline. A historical drama should ideally balance historical accuracy with engaging storytelling, but this film leans too heavily on surface-level spectacle rather than meaningful storytelling. The narrative lacks the depth and complexity required to keep the audience invested. The plot unfolds in a linear and uninspiring manner, with little effort to build suspense or emotional engagement. Instead of drawing viewers into the historical world it seeks to portray, it merely presents a series of overly dramatized and stretched-out scenes that test the patience of the audience.Additionally, the film appears to be solely focused on glorifying the Marathas, which, while a significant historical aspect, does not provide enough substance to sustain the story. Instead of exploring the complexities of the era, the film reduces history to a one-dimensional portrayal of heroism, making it feel more like a nationalistic spectacle rather than an insightful historical film. A well-crafted historical drama should bring nuance to its characters and conflicts, allowing audiences to understand different perspectives. However, in this case, the film's approach feels overly simplistic, lacking the layers that could have made it a compelling watch.Another major flaw is the exaggerated execution of key scenes. While grand battle sequences and intense moments are expected in historical films, the ones in this movie feel unnecessarily stretched. The pacing suffers significantly as a result, making many sequences feel tedious rather than gripping. Instead of immersing viewers in the era's intensity, the film often loses its impact by dragging out moments that could have been executed more effectively with better editing and tighter storytelling.The film's lead, Vicky Kaushal, delivers a performance that seems heavily inspired by Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor's portrayals in Padmaavat. While Kaushal is undoubtedly a talented actor, his performance here lacks the authenticity and depth that could have made the character memorable. There are moments where it feels like he is merely imitating the larger-than-life screen presence of Singh and Kapoor, but without the same conviction or finesse. This results in a performance that feels forced rather than natural, making it difficult for audiences to fully connect with his character.Comparisons to Padmaavat are inevitable, given the similarities in themes and visual storytelling. However, where Padmaavat succeeded in creating an immersive and emotionally engaging experience, this film struggles to achieve the same impact. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's attention to detail, cinematography, and character arcs in Padmaavat elevated it beyond just a historical drama, turning it into a cinematic experience. Unfortunately, this film fails to achieve that same level of grandeur and emotional depth.Ultimately, the movie is a missed opportunity. While it had the potential to be an engaging and thought-provoking historical drama, it instead relies on exaggerated storytelling, stretched-out scenes, and a performance that lacks originality. The film's focus on glorification rather than nuanced storytelling further diminishes its appeal. For audiences expecting a rich and well-crafted historical narrative, this film is likely to be a disappointment. It is an example of how spectacle alone cannot make up for weak storytelling and uninspired execution.",

        "title": "\"DEVA\" - When Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (and Script)",
        "content": "\"DEVA,\" a film that answers the age-old question: \"What if we remade 'Mumbai Police' but with 73% more cigarette smoke?\"Let me paint you a picture - or rather, let me try to see the picture through the perpetual fog of tobacco haze that the director seems to mistake for atmospheric cinematography. Shahid Kapoor plays Dev - or at least I think it's Shahid Kapoor. It's honestly hard to tell, given that he spends most of the movie doing his best impression of a smoke machine at a 90s rock concert.The plot, when visible through the nicotine clouds, follows Mumbai cops investigating an officer's murder. Simple enough, right? Not for DEVA. This movie takes that premise and dices it into so many jump cuts, it's like watching a jigsaw puzzle solve itself backwards. They're playing detective with their own plot, and spoiler alert: even they can't crack the case.Now, let's talk about our lead. Shahid Kapoor apparently misread \"method acting\" as \"chain-smoking method.\" His tough-guy interpretation lands somewhere between a noir detective who forgot his personality at the dry cleaners and a vape shop mannequin who just discovered existentialism. The man has two expressions throughout the film: brooding and... slightly more brooding with extra smoke. It's like watching someone who studied police work exclusively through Instagram noir filters.And because one stoic smokestack wasn't enough, the film gives us TWO versions of Dev - literally smoke and mirrors, as a convenient flashback shows us through an actual mirror. One inhales with angst, the other exhales with slightly more angst. It's the kind of character development you can measure in nicotine patches.Pooja Hegde appears as a journalist investigating police brutality, though her role seems to mainly consist of showing up occasionally to remind us that women exist in this universe. Her character has all the depth of a parking ticket.The cinematography deserves special mention. The film's colour grading looks like they discovered the \"desaturate\" button in editing software and thought, \"This is it. This is cinema.\" It's trying so hard to look gritty that it ends up looking like an Instagram story from 2015.You know you're in trouble when the most emotional relationship in your film is between the protagonist and his lighter.And the twist ending... oh, the twist ending. It arrives with all the subtlety of a marching band in a library. By the time we get to the obligatory prison fights and heroic rescues, you'll be wishing you had spent your money on literally anything else - like, say, rewatching \"Don\" at home with a tub of popcorn.In the end, \"DEVA\" is what happens when you mistake style for substance, cigarette smoke for character development, and confusion for complexity. Sometimes the best special effects are good acting and a coherent script. It's a remake that not only misses the point of the original but manages to create several new, arguably worse points of its own.Rating: Two smoke rings out of five.",

        "title": "A Poor Retelling of a Deva-stating & Derogatory Thriller",
        "content": "Deva (2025) :\nMovie Review -With Deva, Rosshan Andrrews presents a Hindi adaptation of his Malayalam thriller, Mumbai Police. Instead of a gay character, the main protagonist here is a womanizer and a corrupt officer, and that is the only change you will notice. The second change is the addition of Pooja Hegde, aka Heroine's role, which is quite predictable since the hero is not portrayed as a gay character. However, the film suffers more from its dated storytelling than these anticipated flaws. The narrative appears confused about whether to become a mass film or a neat thriller, and in that struggle, the main essence of Deva is completely lost.Based on Mumbai Police (2013), Deva tells the story of an unstable police officer, Deva Ambre (Shahid Kapoor), who is honest, aggressive, and has anger issues. While he is confrontational with every criminal and politician, he is infatuated with a news reporter, Diya (Pooja Hegde). Deva shares a strong friendship with two of his colleagues, almost like a brotherhood. One of them, Rohan (Pavail Gulati), is shot dead on the day he is to receive a gallantry award, and Deva is assigned the task of finding the killer. Deva discovers the killer, but in the next moment, he has an accident. He loses his memory, and his senior officer gives him another chance to find the killer since he has done it before. Will Deva be able to find the killer with little of his past to recall?Since it's been about 13 years, I assume many of you have seen Mumbai Police, so I'll directly get to the point instead of avoiding spoilers. The Malayalam thriller is, by many means, derogatory to the uniform and the main character, who is supposed to earn some respect. In this film, that sexual identity element is removed-thank god-but what's left for the twist then? The configuration of Deva first goes wrong on paper; forget the on-screen material, which is too abrupt and clueless. We have a wild entry for the hero, and while I liked it, how many times do you need that background score, slow-motion walks, and movements to elevate the scene? It becomes tedious right after the first scene. By the time the twist is revealed, you have no patience left to stay and view it. I saw a couple of people getting up and exiting the auditorium even before the full twist was explained. The screenplay is that lengthy and boring. The love story between Shahid and Pooja's characters never started actually, but still you have to put a kissing scene between them and make it look forced.The performance of Shahid Kapoor is decent, but I expect much better from him. The teaser was cut in such a manner that it was supposed to give us an idea of a mass hero, but in the film, it loses that value due to repetitiveness. Kapoor hasn't put in much effort and does remind you of his wild characterization from \"Kabir Singh\" with that arrogant talk and smoking scenes, but beyond that, I didn't find anything good. Pooja Hegde disappoints once again, and I'd really like to see her in character-driven roles in the future. Even a mainstream heroine is okay, but she should have some screen presence and substance that people can remember for at least a while. Pavail Gulati was a perfect fit, Pravesh Rana was okay, Girish Kulkarni was pretty good, while Kubbra Sait and Aditi Sharma passed the time without much effort. The rest of the supporting cast was hardly notable.The biggest fault in \"Deva\" is its technical aspects. The action scenes are poorly designed, and the sound design for the same is terrible. You just can't feel the intensity of those action scenes. Deva is beating the goons brutally, but that brutality is hardly visible to the eyes and ears. The editing also brings the film further down. Two hours and 36 minutes-God, why didn't it end half an hour ago? The Deva rap doesn't help much, and \"Bhasad Macha\" has zero impact. Roshan Andrrews could have skipped the idea of remaking \"Mumbai Police,\" which I personally believe couldn't be successful at the box office. But still, they tried and failed. The box office numbers for this film will only encourage the movement to \"Save Bollywood from remakes\" and are likely to provide another lesson for Shahid Kapoor after \"Jersey.\" Bro, you can't get \"Kabir Singh\" every time.RATING - 4/10*",

Amit Roy's cinematography effectively captures the streets of Mumbai, with real-location shoots adding authenticity. The editing feels somewhat choppy, affecting the film's pacing.

The movie totally centered around Shahid Kappor so the others just had to fade very much in the background. All in all a good film which should not be missed\n7/10.",

Pooja's role felt a bit wasted; I honestly think her character could have made a bigger impact (some interesting ideas popped up in my mind while watching)So to conclude, if you have not checked out the original \"Mumbai Police\" and you're into Malayalam thrillers, give it a go.

        "content": "The movie was nothing like the action-packed adventure promised in the trailer, which was a huge letdown! The editing truly missed the mark; if I could, I'd give it -0 stars!It feels like a desperate attempt by a Malayalam director to break into Bollywood. Unfortunately, this is shaping up to be one of the biggest disappointments of 2025!**1. Lack of Originality:**\nThe filmmakers seemed to have copied the original scene-by-scene without adding any fresh perspective or creativity. What's the point of a remake if it doesn't bring something new to the table? The dialogues felt forced, and the emotional depth of the original was completely lost in translation.**2. Poor Casting Choices:**\nThe lead actors, while popular, were completely miscast. Their performances lacked the nuance and intensity that the original actors brought to their roles. The chemistry between the protagonists was almost non-existent, making it hard to care about their journey.**3. Over-the-Top Drama:**\nBollywood's penchant for melodrama ruined the subtlety of the original. The emotional moments were exaggerated to the point of being cringe-worthy, and the unnecessary song-and-dance sequences felt like they were added just to fill runtime.**4. Weak Direction:**\nThe director failed to understand the soul of the original. The pacing was off, and the narrative felt disjointed. Key moments that were impactful in the original were rushed or glossed over, leaving no emotional impact.**5. Terrible Music:**\nThe original's soundtrack was iconic and perfectly complemented the story. In this remake, the music was forgettable and felt out of place. The songs were forced into the narrative, disrupting the flow of the film.**6. Unconvincing Climax:**\nThe climax, which was the highlight of the original, fell flat in this version. The buildup was weak, and the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying. It was clear that the filmmakers were more focused on style over substance.**Final Verdict:**This Bollywood remake is a classic example of how not to adapt a beloved film. It lacks the heart, soul, and originality of the original and ends up being a forgettable mess. If you've seen the 2005 South Indian version, do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you haven't, watch the original instead-it's a far superior experience.",

However, the screenplay was really bad as well as it's not a commercial movie. This will work only in OTT.Even the best acting couldn't save this movie as it had a really weak climax (although the build-up was really great) you'll keep on guessing who is the real killer?It had some dull moments but having said that it's worth a one time watch only for those who haven't seen the original version.Two biggest problem with this movie is the dull screenplay and lack of chartbuster songs (although there's no scope of songs in this movie). But atleast it should have some bangers. If it was a T-series production, I guarantee it would had atleast 3-4 bangers which would have definitely helped the movie to create the much needed pre-release buzz.P.

The editing truly missed the mark; if I could, I'd give it -0 stars!It feels like a desperate attempt by a Malayalam director to break into Bollywood. Unfortunately, this is shaping up to be one of the biggest disappointments of 2025!1. Lack of Originality:The filmmakers seemed to have copied the original scene-by-scene without adding any fresh perspective or creativity. What's the point of a remake if it doesn't bring something new to the table? The dialogues felt forced, and the emotional depth of the original was completely lost in translation.2. Poor Casting Choices:The lead actors, while popular, were completely miscast. Their performances lacked the nuance and intensity that the original actors brought to their roles. The chemistry between the protagonists was almost non-existent, making it hard to care about their journey.3. Over-the-Top Drama:Bollywood's penchant for melodrama ruined the subtlety of the original. The emotional moments were exaggerated to the point of being cringe-worthy, and the unnecessary song-and-dance sequences felt like they were added just to fill runtime.4. Weak Direction:The director failed to understand the soul of the original. The pacing was off, and the narrative felt disjointed. Key moments that were impactful in the original were rushed or glossed over, leaving no emotional impact.5. Terrible Music: The original's soundtrack was iconic and perfectly complemented the story. In this remake, the music was forgettable and felt out of place. The songs were forced into the narrative, disrupting the flow of the film.6. Unconvincing Climax: The climax, which was the highlight of the original, fell flat in this version. The buildup was weak, and the resolution felt rushed and unsatisfying. It was clear that the filmmakers were more focused on style over substance.Final Verdict:This Bollywood remake is a classic example of how not to adapt a beloved film. It lacks the heart, soul, and originality of the original and ends up being a forgettable mess. If you've seen the 2005 South Indian version, do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you haven't, watch the original instead-it's a far superior experience..",

        "title": "Breaking the Norm: Why This Animation is a Must - Watch?",
        "content": "A Masterpiece of Visual Storytelling: Where Artistic Ambition Meets Pulse-Pounding SpectacleIn the ever-evolving landscape of animated cinema emerges a groundbreaking work that redefines the boundaries of visual narrative - a tour de force that orchestrates a perfect symphony of artistic sensibility and crowd-pleasing entertainment. This animated marvel transcends conventional categorization, presenting audiences with an immersive sensory experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Through its bold fusion of painterly aesthetics and kinetic energy, the film establishes itself as a new benchmark for contemporary animation.The Anatomy of Perfection: Martial Choreography as Cinematic PoetryThe film's combat sequences amount to nothing short of a revelation in motion picture craftsmanship. Each frame throbs with meticulously calculated violence that transcends ordinary action - it's balletic brutality elevated to high art. The animators demonstrate masterful command of temporal manipulation, using judicious slow - motion effects not as gimmicks but as narrative punctuation marks. These deliberate pauses in the chaos serve dual purposes: allowing viewers to appreciate the exquisite detail in every muscle contraction and weapon trajectory while amplifying the visceral impact through dramatic tension - building.When the action accelerates to real - time velocity, the screen erupts in a fireworks display of particle effects and environmental destruction that would make Michael Bay reconsider his career choices. The technical wizardry on display draws favorable comparisons to the renowned Western animated series RWBY. With its unique camera language and precise grasp of action rhythm, this work stands out among numerous animations, creating a distinctive style of its own.Humanity in the Midst of Mayhem: A Tapestry of BrotherhoodBeneath the surface pyrotechnics lies the film's beating heart - an emotionally resonant exploration of male camaraderie that avoids sentimental tropes. The ensemble cast functions as a complex ecosystem of conflicting loyalties and shared burdens. Through subtle facial animations and body language that could rival live-action method acting, the characters reveal layered personalities that evolve organically across the narrative arc.Particularly noteworthy is the nuanced portrayal of fraternal bonds under stress - the unspoken understandings conveyed through shared glances during battle preparations, the protective instincts that override self-preservation, and the quiet moments of vulnerability hidden beneath martial bravado. These relationships attain Shakespearean depth through carefully crafted dialogue that balances poetic introspection with vernacular authenticity.Narrative Precision: The Virtue of Restraint in StorycraftIn an era plagued by narrative excess and manufactured drama, this film stands as a testament to the power of disciplined storytelling. The plot unfolds with the elegant efficiency of a Swiss timepiece, each story beat serving multiple purposes - advancing character development while maintaining relentless forward momentum. Unlike lesser productions that rely on contrived conflicts, the tension here arises naturally from established personalities clashing with environmental pressures.The screenplay demonstrates remarkable respect for audience intelligence, trusting viewers to follow complex political machinations without expositional hand-holding. Character decisions remain consistently logical within established parameters, creating a domino effect of cause-and-consequence that heightens dramatic stakes. Even minor supporting roles receive thoughtful motivation arcs, contributing to the rich tapestry of this fully realized world.Conclusion: A New High Water Mark for Animated StorytellingThis cinematic achievement represents more than mere entertainment - it's a paradigm shift in how animation can engage both heart and intellect. By harmonizing state-of-the-art visual innovation with timeless human drama, the creators have crafted a work that will undoubtedly influence the next generation of animators. It satisfies on every conceivable level: as a technical showpiece pushing the medium's boundaries, as a gripping character study, and most importantly, as pure cinematic exhilaration. For connoisseurs of animation and casual viewers alike, this film doesn't just raise the bar - it redesigns the entire stadium.",

        "title": "Wonderful but only a step away from perfect",
        "content": "This movie presents a complex theme, exploring the contrast between appearances and true nature. Unlike the previous film, which had a simpler message, this one challenges the idea of good and bad. It suggests that so-called good people, despite their virtuous image, may harbor dark intentions, while those labeled as bad, often judged by their outward appearance or reputation, may possess genuine kindness.Bad characters in this story are not simply misunderstood-they might be dangerous, capable of harming others, even causing deaths. Yet, the film shows that their actions do not always define their hearts. On the other hand, the so-called good people, with their pristine, noble appearances, may in fact be hiding selfishness, cruelty, or a lust for power.The turning point of the story comes when those labeled as \"bad\" extend a helping hand, ultimately playing a crucial role in defeating the supposed \"good\" figures, who are, in reality, corrupt. In a powerful moment of sacrifice, the \"bad\" characters willingly give up their own lives to ensure the success of a greater cause. This selfless act reshapes the audience's understanding of morality, revealing that goodness is not about appearance or status, but about one's actions and choices.Another important theme in the film is motherly love. The movie uses flashbacks-some taken directly from the previous film-to highlight the deep, unspoken bond between parents and children. A mother's love is ever-present, even when unacknowledged by the child. The story emphasizes that no parent wishes harm upon their child, reinforcing the idea that love, even when unseen, profoundly shapes a person's journey. The protagonist experiences a shift in spirit, ultimately drawing strength from this realization to confront and defeat the so-called \"good\" figures who are, in reality, the true villains.Visually, the film uses color and setting to reinforce its themes. The grand palace, built from jade-like stone, is decorated in white and green, mirroring the outward purity of those who are perceived as \"good.\" However, this purity is merely a fa√ßade-it is not the palace itself that embodies virtue, but rather the people living within it who uphold their own idea of righteousness. In contrast, the underground palace, is depicted with stone and rock, symbolizing a world hidden beneath the surface, rough and unpolished but perhaps more honest in its nature.Ultimately, it questions whether the younger generation will fearlessly change the world with their young spirit. It challenges viewers to rethink morality-not as something dictated by appearance or authority, but as something revealed through action and sacrifice.In the end, I say it's wonderful but only a step away from perfect because if he had twenty more minutes or so, I think there would be a clearer description of the complex topics. And if some parts at the beginning, which involve humor, were removed and that time was used at the end instead, I think it could become a movie that challenges the Chinese film industry.",

However despite the colorful animation and good character designs, Ne Zha 2 is basically what I dislike about modern animated movies from the whole world.Sure, it's gorgeous animation and ambitious atmosphere is great which I do like. Especially some of the action sequences and presentations are pretty well structured and filmed. However, by simply placing a convoluted plot with many themes together that don't always work, having many characters that aren't interesting, and interlacing with modern humor that is cringeworthy doesn't make the experience worth remembering.It suffers from trying to charm many elements together in one as if the writers tried to smash many ideas into one. Alongside with characters that aren't that emotionally engaging and some coming off a bit unbearable, tone being all over the place, and despite it being non-serious, the non-serious approach and comedic aspects feels forced and doesn't really add up well.Ne Zha 2 is pretty much like illumination Entertainment but from China.

Instead, his heroism is built on the sacrifices of the people of the Qiantang River and his mother. It even relies on actions like stepping on a woman's skirt, belittling and weakening female characters, and using small, powerless figures like the marmot to evoke sympathy. Is this really what a hero should be?In this show, all the supporting characters exist solely to highlight the protagonist's aura. Nezha comes from the lower class, and his defiance against authority is understandable, but his rise to power doesn't feel particularly moving. Characters like the marmot, Lady Shiji, and his mother are all designed to serve his success. These supporting roles could have been vibrant and compelling, yet they are instead portrayed as foolish or weak. And does the plot really need something as trivial as stepping on a woman's skirt to progress? Is this what a hero's rise should rely on?Nezha's character has been portrayed as impolite, which doesn't seem to provide a positive influence on children. Compassion and kindness should be properly guided in young minds, as this is beneficial to society.",

There are no bugs in the whole process. It's very true to the name! In addition, I am looking forward to the arrival of Nezha 3, and I hope I won't wait too long.

Shen Gongbao has his own persistence and cherishing, while immortals have their own selfish intentions. Breaking away from conventions will reveal new 'truths'. Whether it's a demon or an adult becoming immortal, even if the whole world is in front of you, don't forget yourself who has fire in your heart and wants to fight against the world.

        "content": "The film has been criticized for abrupt and rough handling of its narrative pacing. For instance, the transition between the lighthearted comedic tone dominating the first half and the heavy emotional atmosphere of the latter half feels unnatural, resulting in an incoherent growth arc for Nezha. His core transformation relies more on external plot devices rather than internal self-reflection or accumulated experiences. The protagonist's coming-of-age process lacks a \"spiritual baptism\" - pivotal moments like the battle against three demons were dismissed as \"game-like\" sequences that failed to deepen the character's inner conflicts.While attempting to expand its worldview and introduce more characters, the film's character development remains superficial in parts. Though portrayed as a military general, Yin Furen defining moments still revolve around maternal sacrifices, while female characters like Shiji Niangniang are reduced to stereotypical labels like \"appearance-obsessed overweight women.\" The overarching narrative remains centered on male-centric father-son relationships, with female characters lacking independence and depth.The film continues its predecessor's reliance on crude \"toilet humor\" gags. In emotional expression, its exploration of familial bonds and self-identity has been described as \"superficial,\" particularly in failing to fully develop the complex relationship between Nezha and Ao Bing.",

Nezha comes across as authentic, yet funny, and prone to angry outbursts, yet cute and caring. He makes for a great main protagonist, especially in a kids/family movie.A number of support characters, both heroes and villains, are developed well enough (given that so much run time is dedicated to action rather than - see negatives below). And some of the comic relief characters are fun.When driven by and used to support the story, the special effects are often beautiful.The story is clever. The plot is a little more complex than it seems it first; the ending is satisfying; and there's a decent moral to the story. (Maybe even a bit risky in the current political climate in China, depending on how it's interpreted.)Negatives\nNone of the above is exceptional in any way. The characters and plot are well done, but not amazing. The comedy is good, but limited in amount, and very typical for a kids movie. It certainly doesn't have anything really unique the way movies like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, or The Banquet do. Nor does it have the non-stop laughs and of movies like The Great Bicycle Race, Shaolin Soccer, or Detective Chinatown. Nothing very special, plus a major, major flaw...Only about half the movie has the positives, because the rest of the movie is an almost endless, drawn out, over-the-top fight scene - a final battle that goes on and on and on.It feels like at some point the story-teller lost influence with the director, and the animation team took over, jamming in as many effects as they could. Smaller moments throughout the movie are also examples of this. It often starts with just the right animation to show something magical happening. But then doesn't stop until another one, or two, or multiple, effects are unnecessarily thrown into the mix. The tiring end battle is where it really takes over, though and it's hard to express just how overdone it is. It really does detract from what seems a solid family cartoon at its core.With so much of the movie being that non-stop, violent, CGI-heavy final battle, it also seems unclear who the movie is for. There's too much of that for a fun family flick, yet that's clearly what the core story was *meant* to be.",

When I saw Crana told Nexha to find the restroom himself, I immediately know he's gonna pee into something ppl will eat/drink. When I saw Nezha had to use sleeping pill to drug himself for Aubing to take over, I knew Nezha was gonna wake up during a battle and cause a bunch of inconvenience, and of course he will come out fine. It just feels so predictable I don't feel any suspense or anticipation.Additionally, the characters generally don't have any arc, or any show of emotion other than their stereotypical emotion. The mom is prob my fav for showing relatable emotions. Both dads were just showing their love for their kids like it's a task, the emotion only shows up when it's their turn to move the plot. Aubing's dad and the whole race was almost killed by Nezha, but he showed no anger towards Nezha at all. Shen gong bao saw his little brother, who prob walked a long way to find him, and he sends his brother back in a matter of 5 minutes. But somehow he loves his little brother and family so much he'd give up his life to revenge. All these just don't add up for me.",

        "content": "The excellence of the previous film 'Ne Zha: The Birth of the Demon Child' has already filled my expectations. I didn't expect this sequel to live up to expectations. Not only did it achieve comprehensive upgrades in visual effects and character development, but it also brought new shock and emotion to the audience in the deep exploration of the plot and theme, once again proving the unlimited potential of domestic animation. After reading it, it still exceeded expectations by too much! It's a complete blow to the dimensionality reduction of certain Chinese comics! Let's talk about the only drawback first, the initial humor was a bit vulgar. However, the flaws do not overshadow the virtues, as everything else is almost perfect.The visual effect is really stunning! It can be called a masterpiece! The movements are smooth and natural, and every detail is handled very well, as if you are in a real battlefield. The visuals are even more stunning, whether it's the magnificent underwater world or the ethereal Jade Void Palace. The special effects visuals are not only gorgeous, but also very realistic. The scene of thousands of troops fighting in the air pushes the visual effect to the extreme, and the majestic atmosphere is no less than that of Hollywood blockbusters. In addition, the texture of water in the special effects is the most precise and complex, and the shots of seawater are numerous and beautiful, delicate and natural. There are even close-up shots of water patterns and mist, including the effects of seawater washing different materials and the subtle differences in the traces left behind, all of which are presented.The character images in the film are more full and three-dimensional compared to the first one, with each character having their own story and motivation, no longer a simple binary opposition of good and evil. Each character has distinct changes in personality. Increased the radiance and power of humanity.The movie continues the passionate and fantastical style of its predecessor in terms of plot, but also boldly innovates and reconstructs on the basis of traditional mythology. The worldview of the film is more complete, the boundaries between humans, demons, monsters, and immortals are clearer, and there are both contradictions and blends between different races. The plot has multiple echoes with the first part, but it is not just a simple echo, but a sublimation based on the first part.In terms of theme, the film continues the core proposition of \"breaking prejudices\" and expands to more complex social contradictions. The setting of the dragon clan being oppressed by the heavenly court due to their demon identity implies racial discrimination and class solidification in reality; Shen Gongbao's \"rebellion\" motivation has been further explored, highlighting the alienation of individuals by institutional biases. Even the dollar sign on the furnace satirizes some things. In addition, Nezha's transition from \"defying the heavens and changing his destiny\" to \"protecting the people\" explores the balance between individual heroism and collective interests.The music and soundtrack of the film are equally impressive, adding a lot of color to the film. The perfect integration of music and soundtrack with the visuals and plot of the film not only adds more artistic charm to the film, but also better enhances the atmosphere of the film.Overall, this is an excellent film that combines visuals, storytelling, and content. It not only showcases the strong power of Chinese animation after its rise, but also demonstrates the infinite possibilities of traditional Chinese mythology in the modern context.",

I've seen many official production videos. In the initial battle scene, with so many chains appearing simultaneously, it's difficult to make them move flexibly and naturally without any issues of model - penetration. As for the piercing of the heart - piercing curse and the skin that was torn when Nezha was stabbed, since I watched it on an IMAX screen, those details were magnified, and they were incredibly realistic. When Nezha was stabbed, the tear of the skin was clearly visible, with no flaws at all. It's really flawless, and the details are handled perfectly. I truly admire the production team.Some of the funny lines in the film bear the imprint of those from the first film, and it has surprised people like me who love to review. Although it is not tiring to hear, every time you hear it can still make people laugh, but it is undeniable that sometimes it will produce some fatigue, and there is a lack of new jokes.In the content of the plot, like the start of a tight sense of rhythm, immediately into, not dragging, feeling like a second ago just watched the first part. In the middle, there are many new characters, a little worried about whether the characters are too miscellaneous, but the follow-up development is clean and neat, not messy, some of the characters of the scene, so that the image of the key characters is very bright, but also make the emotional aspect reach a new high!Nezha's growth and transformation is a highlight of the film. In this film, he faced a more complex dilemma. When he learns more secrets hidden behind his life, and falls into the dilemma between friends and family, Nezha's heart gradually moves from the initial confusion to firm. He is no longer the hot-blooded, impulsive child who began to show a sense of responsibility beyond his years when faced with a series of difficult choices.The characterization of the little old man and Nezha is in sharp contrast. The little old man in the early stage of a high-level of justice, but later revealed the evil face, the contrast is huge. Nezha, as a demon child, is often misunderstood, seemingly dangerous, but his heart is kind and just, and he has been fighting against fate. The two are like mirror images, and this contrast deepens the plot level, easily triggers thinking about human nature, good and evil, appearance and essence, jumps out of the conventional character setting, and enhances the ideological depth and artistic value of the film. When I watched the movie, I suspected Shen Gongbao, deer boy or dragon, but I did not expect this \"old man who drinks milk powder\"! üòÖ",

        "content": "As an enthusiastic admirer of Chinese mythology - themed animations, the moment I learned about the release of \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\", my excitement knew no bounds. After experiencing this visually - arresting film, I was left with a lasting impression and a wealth of thoughts to mull over.The plot of \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\" is both captivating and intellectually stimulating. It continues the story of Nezha, a cherished figure in Chinese mythology, who is burdened with the fate of being a \"demon child\". The movie chronicles Nezha's odyssey as he confronts fresh challenges and battles against adversity. One of the most alluring aspects of the plot is its exploration of Nezha's internal strife. Despite being branded as a demon, he persistently endeavors to prove himself and perform good deeds. His conflict between his true self and society's expectations strikes a deep chord with the audience. It prompts us to reflect on how we are often judged by others based on initial impressions or pre - set labels, and how we ought to remain true to ourselves in the face of such misunderstandings.The character development in this movie is truly remarkable. Nezha, with his fiery temperament, unwavering resolve, and a heart brimming with kindness, stands at the heart of the story. His character arc, evolving from a rebellious and misunderstood child to a hero who dares to defy fate, is masterfully crafted. We can witness his growth not only in physical prowess but also in mental and emotional maturity. For instance, when he confronts the powerful dragon in the deep sea, his initial impetuosity gradually gives way to strategic thinking and self - sacrifice.Another character worthy of acclaim is Ao Bing, Nezha's friend and occasional rival. Their intricate relationship is a highlight of the film. Ao Bing, constrained by the responsibilities of his family and the Dragon Clan, is compelled to make tough choices. His loyalty to Nezha clashes with his duty to his family, generating substantial emotional tension in the narrative. This complex bond between the two characters enriches the story and showcases the multifaceted nature of friendship and loyalty.The visual effects of \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\" are nothing short of spectacular. The fight scenes are choreographed with great finesse, seamlessly blending fast - paced action with stunning visual effects. Whether it's Nezha's utilization of his magical weapons or the battles between the gods and demons, every scene is a visual extravaganza for the eyes.In addition to the aforementioned elements, the film also features a magnificent soundtrack that harmonizes perfectly with the visuals. The music ranges from energetic and thrilling during the battle scenes to soft and poignant during the more touching moments. It serves to enhance the overall ambiance of the film and draws the audience deeper into the story.In conclusion, \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\" is far from an ordinary animated movie. It is a masterpiece that seamlessly combines a compelling story, well - developed characters, breathtaking visuals, and a wonderful soundtrack. It not only provides entertainment but also imparts crucial messages about self - identity, friendship, and the courage to face challenges. It is a must - watch for both fans of Chinese mythology and animation enthusiasts worldwide. I eagerly anticipate more such high - quality Chinese animated films in the future.",

The depth and care put into these characters make their struggles and triumphs resonate deeply with viewers.However, beneath this surface-level narrative lies a more profound and brutal reality. The antagonist, Immortal Wu Liang, demonstrates a pragmatic ruthlessness by enlisting the Three Dragon Kings, Deer Boy, Crane Boy, and even the Demon Pill to do his dirty work. His actions reveal that he cares little about the source of power, focusing instead on its utility. The powerful immortal factions use cold, calculated methods to exploit the weak, highlighting the merciless nature of this world. Characters who are weaker, regardless of whether they are demons, immortals, or humans, often meet tragic ends, reinforcing the harsh truth that survival depends on strength and alliances.In addition to its rich narrative, Ne Zha 2 excels in its action sequences and visual effects. The fight scenes are exhilarating and visually stunning, providing a thrilling experience that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The pacing of the movie is well-executed, with highs and lows that maintain engagement throughout. Despite these strengths, there are minor issues: the flashback sequence before Ne Zha's mother's death feels somewhat lengthy, and Ao Bing's character development in the latter part of the film leans towards being a plot device rather than a fully realized individual. Additionally, the final battle after breaking the cauldron progresses too quickly, lacking some of the tension and buildup expected from such a climactic confrontation. However, these are relatively small concerns in an otherwise exceptional film.",

        "content": "There is no real rebellion against tyranny here-only a clich√©d, black-and-white struggle against a powerful enemy.First, the antagonists' actions toward Nezha and his family are more of an overt, hostile physical attack rather than oppression through institutional power structures. After all, Nezha is not even part of the system to begin with. The so-called \"rebellion against tyranny\" is merely coincidental-the enemy just happens to possess great power. The fundamental logic remains, \"The enemy harms me (and my family), so I retaliate against this harm,\" rather than, \"Tyranny itself is reactionary, so I oppose it.\" Clearly, the former is a far weaker premise. This kind of setup is childish and clich√©d, rooted in a simplistic, black-and-white, personal-heroism perspective-just like countless Hollywood blockbusters that establish a completely evil villain, only to have them defeated for a cheap sense of satisfaction.The director's cunning lies in making it appear as if the story is about resisting tyranny, while in reality, it is merely disguising the tired old trope of \"justice triumphing over evil.\"What's even more detached from the notion of resisting tyranny is that Nezha 2 externalizes and demonizes the powerful system itself. This process erodes people's ability for critical and dialectical thinking about the real world and the systems they live in. Instead, it encourages them to perceive the reactionary aspects of their own system as something external and absolutely evil. This fosters a simplistic indulgence in the pleasure of moral dualism, reinforcing the idea that one's own faction is absolutely just while ignoring the fact that all systems inevitably contain elements of oppression and authoritarianism. Such an approach only worsens and intensifies the reactionary nature of the existing system.The director's use of these distraction tactics is not an act of defying power-it is, in fact, a form of flattery toward it. After all, those in power would naturally welcome having their own oppressive nature projected onto a rival power, allowing people to become engrossed in an \"us vs. Them\" narrative and thereby ensuring the security of the ruling class.So what is true resistance against tyranny? It happens within the system-when one recognizes the widespread oppression inflicted by power structures and bravely fights back. It is demonstrated through personal choices that embody human courage and the pursuit of freedom. It is not about playing make-believe with childish black-and-white narratives, indulging people in the shallow pleasure of binary opposition while stripping away their genuine capacity for critique and resistance.Resisting tyranny? More like flattering tyranny.",

Although the animation remains visually good, the plot gets lost in a series of confusing subplots and poorly developed secondary characters. The charisma of the protagonist, Ne Zha, is overshadowed by a narrative that seems rushed and lacking in cohesion.The moments of humor, which were a strong point in the first film, here seem forced and repetitive. The emotional depth is often meaningless.Furthermore, the film seems undecided on its tone, oscillating between moments of lightness and darkness without finding a balance. This makes it difficult for the viewer to emotionally connect with the story. A Western viewer in particular struggles to be interested in some purely Chinese themes.In summary, \"Ne Zha 2\" fails to capture the interest, the confusing plot and the poorly developed characters make it an unsatisfying experience.",

        "title": "Lots of terabytes here, but little more",
        "content": "Despite the obvious investment in terabytes, there really isn't much to see in Ne Zha 2 as far as filmmaking is concerned. There are a couple of things worth noticing however in watching this biggest of Chinese blockbusters.First is how Hollywood's blockbuster format has truly become the global template for mass entertainment. Despite being loosely based on a traditional Chinese novel (from the XVI Century no less!), the obvious model for Ne Zha 2 is clearly Hollywood blockbusters, particularly those from the Marvel and DC universes. From the images to the editing to the camera movements, everything is inherited from that not so great template. The use of Western-style music through the entire film is particularly striking and makes you wonder when China lost the love of its own culture.But where Hollywood blockbusters follow a logic of crescendo leading to a big final battle, Ne Zha 2 breaks from its model by bringing full force from the very first scene. And it never stops. The full movie -and it's both its most striking and its most interesting aspect- is a continuous display of strength, and undeniably reflects how China likes to see itself. It's conveyed both through the extraordinary number of warriors of all kinds involved in every battle (showing strength in numbers, a source of pride for China) and also through the constant display of over-the-top visual effects, which aims at demonstrating technological prowess. By anchoring this display of force in traditional Chinese folklore, the movie is also saying that this combative strength is rooted in the very foundations of China.You get the idea. It's not surprising that Ne Zha 2 was funded and supported by Chinese authorities. It speaks the message that they want to drill into the minds of viewers in China and abroad. In good political form, the movie also takes great care not to convey any other message whatsoever, with character motivations limited to being good children and loyal servants and friends. That the movie uses a genuinely American form as the vehicle for this political indoctrination just makes the entire film experience a mix of ironic and surreal.",

Yet beneath the spectacle lies a fiercely human story. NeZha's journey as the misunderstood demon child evolves into a gripping exploration of identity and rebellion, his combustible chemistry with Ao Bing (the Dragon Prince) crackling with tragic complexity. New characters like the enigmatic Sea Goddess add layers of moral ambiguity, challenging simplistic notions of heroism.What truly astonishes is how director Yang Yu (Jiaozi) balances frenetic, kinetic combat (a fiery third-act showdown will leave you breathless) with quiet moments of introspection. The script weaves wry humor and tear-jerking pathos effortlessly, while traditional Chinese instruments in the score clash thrillingly with orchestral might.More than just an animated marvel, this is cultural storytelling at its most vital-a defiant celebration of individuality that resonates across borders.

        "content": "Nezha II, subtitled Demon Child Stirs the Sea, promises a wild, chaotic romp through the oceans, but oddly enough, the film spends little to no time actually stirring up the sea. Instead, we're left with a disjointed narrative that fails to deliver on its own premise. The title feels like a bait-and-switch, setting expectations for aquatic mayhem that never materialize, leaving viewers confused about the filmmakers' intent.The portrayal of Nezha himself is another major misstep. His character strays far from the traditional image of the rebellious, fiery trickster rooted in Chinese mythology. Here, he's morphed into a watered-down, almost generic action hero, stripped of the complexity and edge that define his legacy. This departure feels jarring and alienates fans expecting a faithful adaptation of the iconic figure.The fight scenes, while visually flashy, are a letdown. There's a bizarre lack of physicality-opponents barely make contact, with punches and kicks floating in a vacuum of weightless choreography. It's all style, no substance, robbing the action of any visceral thrill. Add to that a script riddled with logical inconsistencies, and the film starts to feel sloppy. Key character backstories are left unexplained, leaving gaping holes in the plot. For instance, why do Nezha's parents have the ability to fly and endure the Tianyuan Cauldron's torture for so long without turning into immortal pills, yet quiver at the thought of playing kick-the-shuttlecock with their son? It's a baffling contradiction that's never addressed.The film's supposed theme-defying the injustice of fate-falls flat upon closer inspection. Nezha's 'rebellion' against destiny isn't profound; it's handed to him by a divine twist of fate. God gives him the body of a demon child, complete with the power to fight back, so his struggle feels less like a triumph of will and more like a privileged tantrum. Meanwhile, the real victims are the people of Chentang Pass, who suffer the fallout of his chaos without ever getting a voice or resolution. The movie gestures at depth but delivers none, leaving audiences with a hollow spectacle.Visually, the animation is passable but uninspired, recycling ideas without pushing boundaries. The dialogue is clunky, oscillating between melodramatic and mundane, making it hard to care about anyone on screen. Ultimately, Nezha II: Demon Child Stirs the Sea is a misfire-a film that neither honors its titular promise nor offers a meaningful take on its source material. It's a chaotic mess that drowns in its own contradictions, leaving the biggest casualty as the audience's patience.",

There are numerous grand scenes, especially the opening scene where the demon beasts are enveloped by the molten lava of the netherworld and flow out, as well as the climactic battle scene where the two sides' forces converge into a torrent. They are incredibly magnificent and spectacular, giving me goosebumps. The action sequences are as smooth and engaging as always.In terms of the plot, I think it's better than the first one. Firstly, the plot complexity has increased significantly, with a tight pace. At one point, I thought the plot was about to end, but when I checked my phone, only an hour had passed. From the invasion of the Dragon Palace army leading to the failure of the body reconstruction, Nezha went to take the test and was tricked into capturing Shen Gong Bao's father, Shen Gong Bao discovered the conspiracy of the Immortal Wuliang and saved Li Yin and his wife, Nezha was tricked into causing chaos in the Dragon Palace and the Dragon King of the East Sea was captured, Ao Bing regained his body and found Nezha's parents, and everyone discovered the rebellion of the three Dragon Kings and the conspiracy of Wuliang. In the final battle, Nezha was hit by the Three Flavors True Fire and his body was reconstructed, leading the suppressed demons to escape from the furnace. The plot transitions were smooth and reasonable, with all the foreshadowed elements present and strong coherence. In the end, it managed to have a family-friendly conclusion, which is quite friendly to those who like happy endings.In terms of theme, it not only portrays the family affection of \"love always makes one feel indebted\", but also reflects on the inequality among humans, demons and immortals. It shows the arrogance of breaking the unjust world if it is unfair. Moreover, it denounces the brainwashing and violent transformation of others by the privileged to maintain their hegemony. Overall, it is more profound than the first part and does not seem abrupt.",

The cooperation of multiple teams is very similar to a scene in the first movie: all the dragons of the dragon clan tore off the hardest dragon scales on their bodies to make armor.The movie contains many hilarious gags, including the jokes caused by Taiyi Zhenren's usual casualness, the screams of groundhogs, and what Nezha finally said after modifying his image countless times: let's take the first version. Employees, do you feel it?The plot setting is very touching, from the first part of \"my fate is in my own hands\" to the second part of \"breaking prejudices and self-redemption\". When everyone suspected that Shen Gongbao destroyed Chentangguan, the truth came to light, and the audience's misunderstanding of Shen Gongbao perfectly confirmed what Shen Gongbao said in the first part: human prejudice is a mountain that you can't move no matter how hard you try!The film also has many tear-jerking moments. When Nezha's mother hugged her child Nezha tightly even though the sharp thorns pierced her body, when Nezha cried and shouted: I just want you to be proud of me, when Nezha's mother told him: Mother never cared (you are a demon), I found it difficult to control my tears in the cinema.All in all, this is a very good film and I hope everyone gets a chance to see it.

Personally, I feel that the last film to have such a significant impact on the Chinese animation industry was' Journey to the West: The Monkey King Returns' (2015). On the one hand, top-notch visual excellence, scene art, character design, character shaping, and unique Chinese stories deserve every audience to approach the cinema and experience its shock. On the other hand, its clever political metaphor demonstrates China's disdain and disdain for hegemony and its lackeys. Nezha gave a completely different and groundbreaking answer to the hate theme that he loves very much in animated works. Secondly, it once again proves to the world the enormous potential of the Chinese film market and the tremendous progress of the Chinese film industry. Of course, it is not a perfect work either. Personally, I feel that there are still some regrets after watching it: 1. It has set up a lot of funny moments about poop and poop to cater to young audiences, as well as enough hints about plot twists. 2. The large number of characters resulted in many well crafted characters ending hastily in the early stages (such as the Three Dragon Kings). For the production of the sequel, the Easter egg in the movie \"resurrected\" an almost perfectly crafted character. If the next installment is not filmed well, I will feel very sad. In summary, Nezha is definitely a work worth watching in the cinema. My foreign friends, please remember that this is just the beginning. Finally, let's talk about some topics beyond Nezha. The world is not black and white, and even the best movies have their flaws. Life and politics are like this, and we really need more thinking and tolerance.",

This film is more like A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), which is the worst Die Hard.I'm no longer interested in watching 120-pound women win fights against 250-pound bodybuilders in these movies.

        "content": "Cleaner (2025) is the newest action thriller movie from Martin Campbell. Now I was a little skeptical about the movie at first, but I ended up liking it more than I was expected.Positives for Cleaner (2025):\nThe movie does have a cliche setup where you have someone who has to save a group of hostages from terrorists, but it's one of the better movies with that very cliche setup. Daisy Ridley does a good job as the main character and she's one of the more likable protagonists of these types of movies. You get some decent action sequences that do feel grounded enough to be believable. The movie moves a quick pace where it doesn't bore you with dumb stuff and keeps you entertained. Despite having a female lead, the movie doesn't get preachy with any of that dumb female empowerment crap we get nowadays. And finally, this is one of the better background noise movies as I did pay attention to a large majority of the movie.Negatives for Cleaner (2025):\nThe movie is basically another one of these Die Hard rip-offs except with a female lead in the John McClane role. The villains are very generic and forgettable.Overall, Cleaner (2025) is a movie I wasn't to thrilled about at first, but I did like it more than I did. If you like these types of movies, then I would highly recommend this movie.",

It was nice to see her in such type of role & its totally different from all the characters she has played. Also this is best film Martin Campbell has made in last 8 years. My criticism for this film is that the screenplay could have been bit tighter & movie should have been longer, atleast 20 minutes longer also the final act of this film was weak, needed better execution & writing, its still decent but not that good. Daisy had less action than i expected but it was still nice. All the action sequences were very well choreographed. One of the highlights of this film is chemistry between Daisy Ridley & Mathew Tuck, both played siblings and their relationship in this film is very wholesome. Taz Skylar was wonderful, tho i think his character's motives could have been more compelling, his character was interesting, with better writing i think he would have been much more better & scarier. Overall its a fun film to watch, i myself had a very good time watching it. Specially seeing Daisy's performance which was different & great.",

There is a group of terrorists in a building and one lone person has to stop them-sound familiar? Daisy is the lone person, well, her brother Matthew is in the building at the time and Clive is the environmentalist activist/terrorist that takes hostages in the Energy Company's annual gala celebration in London and wants to expose the corruption they do on a daily basis. Taz plays an extremist with Clive that doesn't think Clive is forceful enough. Taz would prefer more of a mass murder scenario to make his point and just blow up the entire building. Daisy is a window washer working late, outside the building 50 floors up when Clive & company shows up. Oh yeah, Daisy is also ex_military so she knows how to handle herself and puts it to good use, taking out Clive's men when they come looking for her.

        "title": "Clean Stories, Writing, and Logic Show Potential For This Movie",
        "content": "LIKES:\nGood Authentic Dialog\nGood Visual Effects\nA Strong Lead\nA Well-Developed Villain\nA Good Message\nIntegrates Modern Themes Well\nA Nice Coordination Response Of Rescue\nA Thorough Introduction\nAction Is Pretty Cool At Times\nSummary:\nThe thing I give Cleaner is that the movie feels very authentic and a fairly realistic interpretation of a hostage situation. Campbell's story team has fashioned a situation that feels approachable in the takeover and the countermeasures to combat it. Cleaner doesn't load it with gravity-defying stunts, superhuman abilities, or these elaborate technological wonders to do it all. Instead, it feels like someone is the hero, who coincidentally has a history to take it on and do it in a logical approach. As Ridley's character, Joey is pulled into the situation, she has a logical means of attack that feels believable, with only a few moments feeling a bit situational and convenient. When the action arrives, the fighting has a nice balance of Hollywood choreography and realism, keeping to the feel of the movie but also being entertaining at the same time. A nice move for me; the integration of the story and character elements sort of spiced things up and helped me remain interested in the character plights as the scene evolved, instead of just an extra fight that felt like pure spectacle for the sake of time bloating. All of this was shot quite nicely, a beautiful blend of cinematography techniques that helped create this unique situation and visual effects that seemed one part CGI and one part authentic props that didn't drown that atmosphere Campbell was bringing to the film.In regards to the other plot elements, Cleaner succeeds better than other films I've seen in a while. Joey's story has a lot of modern-day interests rolled into one film and represents them in a manner that enhances their inclusion rather than undermining them. Her brother's autism, current International crises, and even the sexism aspects are surprisingly rolled into the plot rather than combatting it, which (again) helped give me more care for the other characters. The villain has more layers to him than many of the antagonistic roles call for: intelligence, skills, and an actual legitimate background that is paired well with the insanity. When mixed with the realistic approach mentioned above, the movie feels like a good drama to play in, and the characters feel as if they belong in a book I would read. Throw in some authentic dialog that incorporates the jargon, the attitude, and the emotions while still moving the plot, and you again impress me with the intelligence and coordination of the writing team in charge of the film. Their ability to blend all these components while still bringing a relevant message in a rather straightforward way is not an easy feat, and I was very impressed at what they had to say and how they said it. Finally, all the good writing is brought to life with a talented cast, everyone making legitimate representations without traipsing into melodramatic molds that so many shows choose to take. Ridley in particular showed more of her acting chops, and I applaud how much she can play an action woman when given the right script and direction. The others accomplish things well, but Ridley is the center of the web for me and pulls a lot of things together that I enjoyed in my viewing.DISLIKES:\nBackground Information Is Lacking\nCharacter Development Is Inconsistent\nThe Plot Is Mediocre and Pieced Together\nInconsistent Pace\nToo Realistic?Way Too Much Setup\nThe Action is wrapped up in about twenty minutes\nIs It Original Enough?Summary:\nWhere the movie fails for me, though, is that the film seems to have lost a lot of things in cuts or due to a time limitation. Much of the movie is about the setup, with almost an hour dedicated to her getting in the building to take care of business as the world setup exceeds its welcome. During that time, they tried to do a lot of character development, but I felt this character development was half-baked at times and too compressed, given how much air time she had to reflect. The connections with her mom, her army history, and even the antics with her brother have these well-timed and delivered moments, but something felt missing in these stories, and I wanted to see more of that exploited, given all the buildup. The character development for the cast also feels inconsistent, again, players that seemed like big pieces in the game of chess skirted over when there could have been a lot more to their involvement. In addition, the plot is not the most unique; a lot of elements are shared with Die Hard and not as well pieced together as I enjoy. It's not horrible by any account, but it just needs more finesse and originality to stand out or perhaps more action. Sadly, Cleaner suffers from condensed action for me; the John McClane effect is not as prominent or fun in this film, nor as creative in the execution against the band of bad guys. Perhaps that is where the realism hurts the film, in that the twenty minutes of action feels too short and needs more integration to help chop up that immense setup the movie takes.The VERDICT:\nCleaner is a movie that has a lot of fantastic elements that get their moments to shine and thrive. The smart writing and direction have pulled much of the film together, allowing for a tale that feels believable, in-depth, and relevant on many levels yet does not become too political or undermining at the same time. It makes good use of characters, intelligently crafted players, and logic that plays nicely with reality and does not require too many conveniences to accomplish. Ridley's acting shows so much talent, and her ability to keep so much together and play well with so many characters was a nice change of pace compared to other films she has been in. Under Campbell's direction, this film is well-executed on many technical aspects while also doing a solid job of an action story. Yet, the movie fails to fully unlock that potential for me. The setup is too long and doesn't have enough of the background diving to make it worth it, nor do some very interesting characters have their full delivery compared to all the time Joey gets. In addition, the action, while good at times, is too short and lacking for the time it took to get there in the nearly two-hour runtime. As such, the movie doesn't feel original, nor does it balance things out to the degree I think the advertising suggested it would. Upon reflection, this movie feels like an Amazon original/streaming original, and this would be the optimum area for you to invest your time and money into. When factoring everything together, I would give this film:\nAction/Drama/Thriller: 7.5\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

With a script that recycling every idea from a variety of box-office hits. Despite a talented cast and skilled director, it's little more than a spliced-together version of better films-specifically, riffs on the Die Hard (1988) scenario, where a single hero fights off terrorists in an isolated location. Most of such copycats & borrows followed in the 1990s and innovated with unique settings, such as a Navy battleship in Under Siege (1992), a plane in Passenger 57 (1992), a mountain in Cliffhanger (1993), a bus in Speed (1994), a hockey stadium in Sudden Death (1995), and the twin White House examples from 2013, Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down. I have seen so many movies like this that the subgenre has moved beyond mere variations on a theme and entered the realm of mind-numbing cliche, mainly because studios seldom attempt to deviate from a proven formula. A great movie may yet come along and revive the concept, but Cleaner is not. This was only a one-time watch, not thinking about this movie and not going to bother having it on vod because it would consider be a bust. 5.5/10 the action is good but characters dialogue is demanding sometimes.",

I anticipate that I may forget this movie in short timeWhat I like: Daisy Ridley is likable; the scenes with her brother are charming; and I like the London setting. The action scenes are well-done. I was concerned, based on the premise, about scenes where a tiny girl overpowers some 200 pound men, but really - the movie doesn't over-do it. Daisy's character relies more on stealth than force/strength. The window-cleaning scenes are also fun. The movie captures the tenseness of being so high off the ground in some scenes. Nothing in the movie, from dialogue to CGI, is cringe or embarassingly low-qualityWhat I didn't like: the biggest flaw, by far, is that there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The movie is an amalgam of action movies cliches, borrowing many elements from Die Hard and the Jean Claude Van Damme/Jason Statham movies. The entire plot basically goes in the direction that you would predict, aside from one early major death (no spoilers; I won't say). The other main issue is that the villains aren't as charming or interesting as the lead. The main villain is Lucas Santos, and there is a lot of attention towards his hatred of humanity (the movie itself seemingly plays on his views by referencing Thanos, who advocated killing half of humanity). Overall, Lucas Santos is too over-the-top psychotic, almost to the point of cartoonish. His diatribes against humanity begin to drag on. I also would've cast a different actor in that role. The actor who plays Lucas doesn't impart the fear that this role required.6.5/10.",

The action is serviceable, the villains are a yawn, and the characters, their motivations, dialogue, and their resolution are all too generic to leave a lasting impression. On top of that, the pacing drags in places, the ending fails to deliver, and the emotional beats between the siblings never quite land. Does it attempt to make a statement about environmental destruction and corporate accountability? If so, it does so in the dullest way possible.Die Hard, this is not, so the comparisons are moot. Here, the villains hold all the cards (they control the police, the building, and the hostages) and yet the heroine somehow becomes an inexplicable problem for them. There's a script issue, but also an execution problem, as Miss Ridley is competent in the role, but her casual attitude while committing \"action\" feels jarring and undermines any sense of real danger.At least it is short (90 minutes, and it feels even shorter).

They could have had a really cool movie here, but the structure and the plot decisions kept it from getting really good. I still give it a 7 star rating, and will probably watch it again sometime. It's a shame that a movie with such a good set-up managed to botch much of the promised potential in the third act.

This is very much like a Die Hard 1 remake, but totally different plot, story, and acting. It was quite well written and acted and the dialog was smart. All the action was very well choreographed and the fight scenes exceptional. Who cares if it was a die hard like movie? This was WAY better than anything Willis did after Red, and it wasn't really like die hard in the least other than a skyscraper. The older brother of Joey Michael Locke (Mathew Tuck) plays a very convincing autistic brother with a knack for hacking with other issues as well. Found this to be a very entertaining, engaging action movie that delivers. Would see this again a few more times and it has earned a place in my top 30 list to date. Nothing questionable, no nudity, lots of violence, some foul words and gestures but not really bad.

Mainstream movie watchers may not be aware of it but a kind of budget action cottage industry exists with older 80s stars like Dolph Lundgren and action stalwarts like Scott Adkins and Michael Jai White. Some are great, some terrible, many are... basically fine ? Some decent action, mostly workmanlike writing with the occasional clunkfest of a scene shoehorned in to give the more actory actors something to do (in this one it's a deeply forced bit of \"bonding\" between the protagonist and a police officer) but broadly speaking, \"worse ways to kill 90 ish minutes, 5 ish stars\" kind of deals. Watch, sort of enjoy in a veg-out way, shrug, carry on with your life.Ignore the histrionics from \"that type\" of reviewer - aside from a single moment, this is just one of those except starring Daisy Ridley (who maybe took it because it wasn't her usual type of role or maybe this is one of those where the original script was much better than the movie turned out) with Clive Owen putting in a half-shift. That single moment completely ruins the film though unfortunately because it's _so_ \"written\", _so_ purely just there so the rest of the movie can happen that it makes everything afterwards pointless (no spoilers but about half-way through there's a scene where the hero can take a single, very obvious action to make a lot of the bad stuff stop happening and doesn't, for... reasons ?). This is not a particularly smart movie in general but that moment is excruciatingly, insultingly stupid.Other than that, i've seen way worse.

The fact she couldn't commit to the hair tells you how much this film stinks.

The action is boring, the plot a devine mess and the characters are so uninteresting and underdeveloped that the scene between Daisy & Ruth, the Police chief seems so disingenuous you'll more than likely laugh out loud, they must have been embarrassed to even have that conversation it's so unnatural and forced. You don't care for any characters plight, Daisy never feels in danger (she still has the force) and the bizarre sound choices during fights and obvious misdirected punches look more like a drama school production than a film that actually was in cinemas. This is diabolical, memorable only for its lame attempt at modernizing Die Hard with a heavy feminist and liberal hand on the redraft. Global Warming....seriously? If you wanted to be topical and current they should have tackled immigration, but they obviously had no stomach to at least try and be brave.

        "title": "Cleaner has strong assets in star Daisy Ridley and director Martin Campbell, but its plot is cobbled together from superior sources with little to contribute",
        "content": "Joanna \"Joey\" Locke (Daisy Ridley) is a window cleaner working at the tower headquarters of Birtish energy conglomerate Agnian Energy having struggled holding down a stable life after washing out of the army. After her autistic brother Michael (Matthew Tuck) is kicked out of yet another care home, Joey brings him with her to work on the day Agnian CEOs Geoffrey (Rufus Jones) and Gerald Milton (Lee Boardman) are hosting a shareholders meeting highlighting their latest eco initiatives. Joey becomes stranded on a suspended scaffold when eco terrorists led by Marcus Blake (Clive Owen) take over the event with the intention of forcing confessions out of all the high profile Agnian members. As Joey hangs precariously from the edge she has to find a way to save her brother as the already tense situation conceals even more horrifying intentions.Cleaner comes to us from noted action veteran Martin Campbell and is another entry in Die Hard mold of action films wherein a \"blank is seized by an all-star team of terrorists and only one blank can stop them.\" Despite a time tested setup that's usually reliable for high concept genre fun and a director with a strong pedigree, I'll admit I approached the film with some skepticism as Campbell's had a run of misfires since his last genuinely good film The Foreigner in 2017 (especially with Dirty Angels arguably replacing Campbell's terrible 70s sex comedies as the nadir of his career). While Cleaner is perfectly watchable, it's also a not particularly well written movie where most of the goodwill comes from the acting and directing than from the screenplay.In terms of leads, Daisy Ridley is more than up to the challenge of doing a movie like this and Joey as a likable hardscrabble protagonist just trying to get by before being thrust into this extraordinary situation. The movie also employees relatively limited CGI (very welcome as anyone who saw Dirty Angels can attest) and with Campbell's gritty and grounded direction there's actually pretty solid impact during the action beats. Honestly it seems like all the pieces are in place for a fun Die Hard clone, but unfortunately the script and its execution of the tropes is where we see some stumbling points. While the trailer implies very heavily that a certain actor will serve as the primary antagonist, the role in actuality is more of an extended cameo and the total screen-time is maybe 10 minutes at most. Admittedly there's a good idea behind the rug pull and the actor who becomes the big bad is pretty decent (you'll most likely recognize him from the live-action One Piece series), but it also feels like a massive waste of one of main actors used to sell it to the audience. But aside from the issue of who isn't in this movie, that's not as grating as who is in the movie.Joey's brother Michael played by Matthew Tuck is a massively irritating and feels like a remnant of how you'd write neurodivergant characters 15 or 20 years ago in things like Mercury Rising. The exaggerated performance and character isn't helped by some massively misguided dialogue referencing Piers Morgan (in a way that reminded me of John Bradley from Moonfall) or The Avengers because of the character's \"quirk\" of carrying a plastic Thor hammer. But I think the biggest issue probably comes from the pacing of the movie with the building takeover happening about 30 minutes into the movie while Joey doesn't actually enter the building until the 60 minute mark in an 88 minute movie not including credits.Cleaner has the feeling of disposable action fodder but its direction and the majority of its cast help elevate it to watchable. While there have been better Die Hard clones, I've also seen worse ones such as SAS: Red Notice, The Doorman, or Skyscraper this at least feels like it has some resources and craft it can boast even if it's in service of not particularly good material.",

        "content": "I so wanted this film to be good it's a shame it couldn't produce on the promises. It has a good cast, a solid if a little unoriginal premise this unfortunately results in a lackluster Die Hard wantabee that feels like it didn't know what it wanted to be it's slow start is excusable as the main characters are introduced in a slightly clunky manner.As the story unravels the disjointed plot seems to not fully understand what it wants to be and spends time building in one direction to pivot and swing from a survival against all odds to an army of one. This results in both being slightly disappointing a weak narrative and a one dimensional story that lacks developement and has unlikable protagonists. Above all the romp that should make up for any plot holes or weak characterisation with an exciting non stop action adventure is just not there.This average attempt just shows again that as good a film makers the British are we just can't seem to do the blockbuster action movie that's the staple of American cinema and when we attempt to do so something about it just feels sad and a little silly this wasn't always the case but modern British action movies don't stand up well to the American attempts.",

Still, there's some unexpected twist and turns here but for the most part it's all been seen and done before.

        "content": "I am all against comparing movies but I have to compare \"Cleaner\" with \"Die hard\". They belong to the same genre of \"hero rescuing multi hostages in high rise\". One's in New York, the other in London (with delightful British \"accent\"). One hero is a middle-age cop with some marriage hiccup as his background story. The other is a young women, a commercial high-rise window cleaner with, before that, military training. Her burden is her mentally disturbed brother who relies heavily on her emotionally. The villains in \"Die Hard\" are greed-driven. In \"Cleaner\" there are 3 layers of villains, starting with environmental group of extremists. But then some of them consider the \"extremist\" too weak and escalate the operation to terrorist territory. The original leading is eventually eliminated when things further escalated to an annihilation-focused psychopath who kills the original leader. Finally, one big difference between these two movies. \"Die hard\" has been hailed by many as one of the best Christmas movies ever made.\"Cleaner\" starts with the titled protagonist, as a pre-teen little girl self-trained with skills of moving around the apartment without having to touch the floor. As the parents, habitually yelling against each other, are heard approaching the door from the corridor, Joel (Poppy Townsend White) maneuvers herself, in the kitchen, at midpoint between floor and ceiling, to the window. Next thing, she sits comfortably there facing the panoramic night view of London, with her feet dangling a couple of hundred feet above the city below.The next scene introduces the audience to the difficult, yet touching situation between Joel (Daisy Ridley) and emotionally disturbed (but undeniably intelligent) brother Michael (Matthew Tuck). It is heart-warming to see that whatever difficulties occur between them, a \"squeeze\" (hug) cures all. Due to circumstances I wouldn't bother to detail, Daisy finds herself with no alternative but to leave Michael in the hands of kindly co-worker (building security guard) while she goes about with the daily work a couple of hundred feet outdoors, at the towering commercial building, while a promotional gala is held at the plush top floor with not a few political heavyweight as guests. Enters the bad guys and the fun begins.Only one or two more comments and I'm done. Clive Owen plays the aforementioned, soon eliminated and replaced original leader of the gang. Not so short an appearance as to be called a cameo but certainly not long enough for those who think they are coming to watch Owen. Ridley carried the movie, beautifully. But then, we expect nothing less from Rey Skywalker.",

The only person who seemed to be consistently enjoying it was a lady whom I'm pretty sure was taking advantage of the fact that the theater serves adult beverages.Giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because I think the animation style was unique and very well done. However the frenzied pace and colorful style seem keyed to a very specific young-adult and adult audience.

The characters come across as disappointingly flat, each lacking genuine depth or development. From beginning to end, their motivations and arcs remain stagnant. The plots felt clearly pieced together (I can even name books and chapters). The action sequences and visual effects feel serviceable at best, but there's nothing particularly groundbreaking or memorable about them.I was hoping to see something like The Wild Robot but ended up getting Dragon Ball Z. The result is a middle-of-the-road adaptation that neither celebrates the potential of its source material nor brings anything new and exciting to the table.

There were very few slower parts for you to take a breath and process what you just watched. Everything in between those parts was CRASH! BANG! WOOPS! AHHHHH! It was loud, it was in your face, and It was relentless. They even played to this chaos with one of the robot characters named 80HD (ADHD). Anyone with visual and audio stimulus issues should avoid this movie. By time the movie ended, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.The story wasn't even that good. I mean, I got it but I just barely got it after muscling my way through all the stimuli, and I'm 40yo. I'm confident no kid watching this will understand the plot and story. They're just watching for the visuals. And the visuals are distracting from the fact that the story was mediocre at best.Children's movies made today do kids a great disservice. There was once a time when kids had the attention span to sit through a movie that wasn't a constant assault on the eyes and ears and there was a complex (for a kids movie) storyline that involved character development, something this movie didn't have any of.The only reason I'm giving it 4/10 is because my son said he loved it. If he hadn't, this would've been a 2/10.",

One of the best parts about this show is how clean the style is and I found it very enjoyable to watch.There's also a great underlying message for younger audiences and it does a solid job of bringing everybody's character arcs full circle in a short 90 minutes.With that being said, the main character feels like he's more of a supporting character for the cat who ends up having more development than anyone. Dog Man feels like he's just missing something and it feels a bit lacking at times.Overall it's decent. Not something I'd rewatch and nowhere near the quality of \"The Wild Robot\" but it was good for what it tried to do.",

He didn't get out of his chair once, and that has never happened before. He also didn't laugh, and I didn't hear any of the other kids in the theatre (which was full) laugh either. My husband actually fell asleep. The animation was adorable, the voice acting was fine, but something was missing. Kiddo said he liked it, but hasn't spoken about it since, which means it made absolutely no impact on him. If you like it, fine, but it was a miss for us, and I wish we had waited for streaming.",

        "content": "I used to read a lot of the Dog Man books, and they were pretty fun. A dog head on a mans body is a cool concept, and certainly can explore the realms of interesting ideas.The first couple books in the series are great, and are similar to the start of the movie whereas you have a main villain (Flippy or Petey), and Dog Man needs to stop them. The execution of these scenes were great, and pretty enjoyable.I had a good time with all the actions scenes, it felt like a pretty good cops and robbers movie and I feel like they could've made it one. This could've been a unique story in the franchise. Instead, they chose to do an amalgamation of all the books. This is fine, but for me personally the books really fell off after the introduction of lil petey. I was concerned they were going to go to this route with the movie, and unfortunately they did.Well this is represents the books well, I just don't think the story was good. The second half and later parts of the movie were just bland. Felt like I've seen it a million times before in other pieces of media. They had the opportunity to explore a new and creative story but they didn't take it.Some people don't like when media strays too far away from the books, but in the end I think this movie would've really benefited from it. Maybe I'm judging it too harshly since the target demographic is probably like 6 year olds, but yeah, could've been better. There were plot lines that they could've used, such as when we find out the guy who was Dog Mans body has a girlfriend. It's explained that she just instantly left them, but it could've led to a different story had it been done differently. The movie had its moments, but isn't anything crazy.",

If the movie made over 30 million on opening weekend rather than 18 million, that's nonsense, it was just a coincidence. I guess DreamWorks crossed that damn line. And all that remains is still a popular book itself, but why don't you go make yourself another title for \"Dog Man\" like for example: another title for \"Pigeon Impossible\" is \"Spies in Disguise\". But do not use the same title from a popular book, novel, or short movie.

My second and final gripe is how fast they explain the backstory of Flippy. It felt a bit rushed and maybe shoehorned in during the midst of production.

From the witty jokes to the heartbreaking character development, this movie did not miss one mark.

Albeit the implications of this is horrifying, it does make for some heartfelt moments. One issue I have with the story though is that things are introduced but are quickly established with no real development. For example, one of the villains, Flippy the Fish, is quickly brought up, however they automatically have evil motives with no real reason behind why those motive are there. Flippy is essentially there to create more of a conflict between the Dogman, Petey, and Lil Petey. Also, the jokes can be hit or miss. Some jokes are hilarious and definitely land, however, others are more juvenile, especially the fart jokes. Additionally, I do appreciate how the film celebrates and stays true to the comics of the same name. I've personally never read any of the books, but I can see all fans of the books really enjoying this film.The animation is also incredibly expressive and adorable. I love the comic-like style of the animation, as it really feels like the movie came out straight of a comic book. The characters are also very pleasant to look at, and the film manages to make simple 2D designs translate well in 3D. It's definitely one to keep the kids engaged and one that adults can enjoy as well.The characters are also very cute and enjoyable, however, some jokes that the characters make can get annoying after a while. For instance, Lil Petey has a repeating joke of answering \"why?\" to his clone, Petey the Cat. It's cute at first but it drags on and just becomes annoying. Despite this, Lil Petey is still an adorable little character that adds the heart of the film. I also have to praise how the team behind the film kept the main character, Dogman, as a silent protagonist whose main characteristics are dog-like. This actually adds more heart to the film because DogMan's character is solely built on actions rather than dialogue. He is portrayed as a kind, playful, and intelligent dog. Additionally, the main villain, Petey, has intent behind his over the top actions, as the film discusses real life topics such as abandonment from authority figures (in this case, parents) and seeing the world as a cruel and unjust place. It brings more heart and allows Petey to have a character arc of his own.Overall, I can definitely recommend this film to fans of the original DogMan comics and children, as children and fans will have a great time seeing this film. Adults can also enjoy this film too, however it may be too childish at times and the animation can be hyperactive, probably making the film a little too much for adult viewers.",

I am somewhat familiar with the animations tyle of the author and find the cartoony aspect to be quite entertaining. There are also quite a few cute, touching and dark messages int he movie which are well balanced for a kid movie.And now for the negative aspect. I understand that this is a kid movie but I was disappointed by the direction the movie took. There are actually 3 stories packed in this movie which causes it to fluctuate from one storyline to another. It's a Saturday cartoon-style approach, which works fine in its setting, but in this particular movie, it was a bit dizzying and broke the flow of the movie.",

        "content": "LIKES:\nGood Pace\nAdorable Mood\nFamily Friendly\nFunny\nClever Writing At Times\nGreat Voice Acting\nGreat Music\nSurprisingly Deep\nThe Art Style Still Impresses Me\nDISLIKES\nStupid At Times\nCould Have Had A Little Better Action\nMontage Jokes Get Old\nA Lot In One Story\nVery Rushed In Story At Time and Too Much In One FilmThe VERDICT/Summary\nDogman takes on the same vibes of his predecessor book/film. It's a lot of fun for the family, with silly jokes and slapstick humor that had both old and young chuckling at the humor this movie is drenched in. The hybrid pooch is an adorable mascot who is ready to strike every heart hard with heartfelt emotion and hope that can bring a tear to one's eye. All the adorable energy is packed in this movie, and so many characters will have one going, \"Awwwwww,\" at what they do for the film. The jokes are pretty safe, yet not to the point that adults will groan as the movie makes plenty of pokes at itself with questions, one-liners, and running gags that sometimes traipse into adult humor. The voice acting takes point for me as well, much of my laughs came from the way the lines were said more than the actual laughs, especially Lil Rel Howery and Isla Fisher, who had some of the best dynamics of the bunch. Yet, the movie does have other levels, the film's characters having deeper story arcs and drives that teach lessons, evolve, and still manage to be fun for the whole family, making this story better than I thought it would be. To balance it all out, Dogman has an awesome soundtrack to keep that energy going, many of which match the art style I find super fun to immerse myself in. All the colors and the unique book-like, semi-motion capture feel worked for me, as if the storybook was coming to life in that unique look.However, I'm not the target audience for this franchise, and Dogman's main issue is the fact of being too silly or stupid for me at times. With all the jokes that they launch at you; the film crams a lot of forced humor in a short amount of time and doesn't have too many resets in between. Certainly, this is fun for younger audiences who can't get enough, but for audience members like me, you might wish that the movie had a little more to it than another dog or doughnut joke. The action could have gotten a little more cartoony and composed, the film missing several moments to use the creativity and energy to make very fun and dynamic fighting with their punches and comedic tactics. The film feels very anticlimactic, and sometimes the jokes get very stale when they double back for the fifteenth time. It's a lot of things crammed into one movie in what I guess feels like five stories, all compacted into one movie with the hopes of adding easter eggs to the film to go with this semi-original story. As such, I found the film to have too much in one film, something that seems to be a growing trend in the movie world. When factoring all of this together, Dogman is a film that is going to be a great family outing, or fans of the books ready to dive back in with a montage-heavy tale. I find it theater-worthy for a lot of people and would encourage a trip to your local screen if you can.I give Dogman the following scores:\nAction/Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Crime/Family/Fantasy/Sci-Fi: 7.5\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",

        "content": "Firstly, I should say that whoever created the trailer is a genius as it was this that sold the film to me, my son and my wife.The actual film however is literally hard to watch. From the very opening sequence. It feels as though you are watching most of the film on x2 speed and it is almost disorientating to try and focus on any one thing.I am sure there are endless numbers of in-jokes planted in various billboards/building names (a la 21 Jump Street), but there is never chance to stop and let these land. Likewise, the dialogue is near-incomprehensible due to its speed of delivery and shoutiness.What makes this even more of an issue is the times of pathos, when the film slows down. At these points it feels like you're watching things in slow motion.With very little knowledge of the source material or writer, I have to assume these are conscious choices linked to the constant jokes around 'Eighty HD' (heard as 'ADHD'). Other annoying choices such as spelling 'Super' as 'Supa' and 'Cops' as 'Copz' at every given opportunity feed into this narrative that the writer and/or director are trying to make a heavy-handed point.As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Captain Underpants a few years ago, I have absolutely nothing against absurdist comedy of this nature, but Dogman felt badly misjudged.My 3-year-old son, who loved Mufasa: The Lion King, Inside Out 2 and Encanto on the big screen, really struggled with this one and twice I had to tell him to stop banging his head on the seat (the first time he has ever done this and I can only think it was due to sensory overload - I felt it too!) By the end, he was in tears; not in a good way, but rather with how much he hated 'the fish'.I have since seen a lot of reviews which describe the film as being great, but I couldn't disagree more.This was the worst film I have seen since Bee Movie and - had I not been with my family- I would have walked out.The only single positive I can give is that the film is around 90mins long (though it did feel like it was never going to end).",

        "content": "Dog Man (2025) is the newest animated offering from DreamWorks Animation and I had fun with the movie.Positives for Dog Man (2025):\nI have to give credit to Peter Hastings for his work in here because not only is he the writer and director, he is also the voice actor for the main character of Dog Man and he does bring a lot of charm and likability to this character. It's clear that he does care about this character and I'm happy to see that on screen. I really liked the dynamic between him and Lil Rel Howery's Chief. Pete Davidson was great as the villain Petey Montage which I find hilarious and surprised given I'm not a big fan of Pete Davidson, but he did win me over with this character. I also liked Li'l Petey as the clone of Petey only because he was a cute kitten. You also have Ricky Gervais as Flippy the Fish and he's great here too. There is some good humor throughout the movie that made me smile. And finally, the third act with the final battle was a lot of fun.Negatives for Dog Man (2025):\nAside from Dog Man, the movie is lacking with some of the character development here. I was a little annoyed with how the movie tries to give Dog Man a journey to get his police job back because prior to that, he was doing a fantastic job at capturing Petey Montage, unfortunately since the person who fired him is too stupid to realize that the person running the prison is incompetent, I was a little angry with this plot point. I was also not a fan of the movie trying to make two characters into either good guys or sympathetic by the end because it felt so forced.Overall, Dog Man (2025) is a great animated movie from DreamWorks Animation and while it's not one of their best, I would still recommend this movie to fans of animated movies and DreamWorks.",

At any second in the movie you can pause and see fantastically incredible animation that is truly on the level of greatness with such media as Spider Man Across The Spider Verse and Attack on Titan.

With the funny moments, there were also some sad ones however but there were also wholesome ones, such as when Petey reads Lil' Petey's book and when Flippy reads the book Lil Petey made for him as well. Probably what me into Dog Man overall. There are also some nice collector cups and popcorn buckets you can get if you go see it at Cinemark.",

        "content": "When I was a kid, Dog Man was one of those books that felt like it shouldn't exist. It was pure, unfiltered chaos-an absurd mix of toilet humor, slapstick action, and weirdly emotional moments about family and redemption. My friends and I passed the books around like contraband, cracking up at Petey's schemes and Dog Man's relentless optimism. I remember doodling my own versions of the characters in my notebooks, convinced that Petey's tragic backstory made him the real hero of the series.Now, watching Dog Man on the big screen, I was hit with that same mix of ridiculous humor and unexpected heart. DreamWorks' adaptation captures the wild energy of Dav Pilkey's books, though it also raises some eyebrow-raising questions about its messaging.The film follows Dog Man, a half-dog, half-man cop, as he battles crime, but let's be real-Petey the Cat (voiced brilliantly by Pete Davidson) steals the show. His journey from criminal mastermind to struggling single dad is surprisingly compelling, making it easy to root for him over the titular hero. Given that Petey grew up without a father, the movie subtly asks: Did that push him toward a life of crime? And if so, is redemption truly possible? These deeper themes add unexpected weight to a story that also features an epic mecha fight and a giant robot with a butt-cheek exit door.Visually, Dog Man embraces a cartoony style reminiscent of The Mitchells vs. The Machines, though it lacks that film's full comic book aesthetic. The humor is a mix of clever gags and outright silliness, with some moments landing better than others. That said, small details-like Petey's uneven number of whiskers-are weirdly distracting.The voice cast is mostly strong, with Pete Davidson as the clear standout. His performance gives Petey real personality, making his arc feel genuinely earned. Ricky Gervais, on the other hand, feels miscast, though thankfully, his role is brief.Despite the film's fun, it does raise some questionable themes. Cat Jail is clearly a fast track to mass incarceration, and while Petey gets his redemption, what about the other jail cats? They deserved a pardon too. The movie's message-that even criminals can change-is solid, but it doesn't fully grapple with the systemic issues it touches on.In the end, Dog Man is a fun, visually engaging adventure with a surprising amount of heart, even if it leans into some unintended copaganda. While kids will love the slapstick humor, adults might find themselves wondering, why am I actually rooting for the villain?",

A policeman with Kung Fu skills and his sidekick dog are chasing Pete-the super villainous cat criminal-when they are seriously hurt while in pursuit.

        "content": "I've enjoyed some of Mel Gibson's movies, but this is truly the worst film I've seen in the last decade.The script could have been generated by artificial intelligence, and the same goes for the visual effects. The script is a complete mess, and the characters are completely two dimensionally written, which is a surprise as there's basically only three characters in the film - the twisted baddie pilot (Mark Wahlberg, dreadful), the irritating nerd (Topher Grace - appalling), and the plucky Air Marshall (Michelle Dockery - what was she thinking).The entire thing is laughable. A single propellor plane nosedives towards the snowy mountains, and smashes into the snow, but somehow, erm, flies through and keeps going the other side. The conceit that they are \"stuck in the freezing wilderness inside a small plane\" is discovered half-way through to be solvable because... oh the air Marshall had an iPhone with satellite connectivity that she forgot about? That works with crystal-clear communication every time.Truly terrible film-making. Avoid at all costs.",

        "content": "I'm sorry but I lost count on the reality scale of this flight. The blow up doll in Airplane had more to do with reality than this flight on all levels. Speaking of levels, 3000 feet in Alaska for autopilot? In the mountains? And the autopilot situation. How is it she put it on autopilot and suddenly it shows the plane climbing and turning to the left? And then headsets come off midway through the flight as if they suddenly can hear each other now. Miracle? And talking on the headset without any buttons. Sure. Hello Hollywood. And she didn't think Sat phone first? Seriously? My favorite was her punching through a snow cap and the plane just keeps flying straight and level. Amazing. And that dive she pulled out of...would have ripped the wings right off the plane. And the pilot sweet talking her after she's nearly killed and in shock having to fly a plane for the first time...please. Give me a break. So hoaky and his instructions for landing the plane...so unrealistic and obviously written without zero consultation with a real pilot.",

        "content": "Mel Gibson is a great filmmaker. I think what people must not be understanding here is that whilst all of his previous directorial outings have been deep and heavy for want of a better description, he has stated that he made Flight Risk as pure popcorn entertainment. That is exactly what he has done, and what fun it is.Wahlberg has a blast with a wonderfully over the top sadistic and bald performance, Topher Grace provides good comic timing, but Michelle Dockery carries the film and actually gives it some heart. Her performance is far better than a film like this would ordinarily demand. It's shot well, with the tension and pacing being spot on.I think it shows Gibson's versatility as a director. A short and taut thriller made in just 22 days.It does nothing new and it is was it says on the tin.......a really fun popcorn flick.",

But here's the harsh reality: it's an absolute mess. The ideas are disjointed, fragmented, and utterly incoherent, as if the script was scribbled during a caffeine-fueled ADHD episode.The so-called \"humorous\" start quickly falls flat, revealing a lack of substance or cohesion. The storyline goes nowhere, and the characters are as forgettable as the dialogue. To make matters worse, the cinematography is mediocre at best-uninspired shots, poor framing, and nothing visually striking to salvage the train wreck.It's not just disappointing-it's insulting to the audience's intelligence. Save yourself the time and money, because this film is an exercise in frustration, not entertainment.",

        "content": "I wasn't even going to go see this film after seeing the preview. It just looked so standard in the ad, and I felt it gave away too much of the story. Then I noticed it was directed by Mel. So, I thought why not, I've seen everything else he's directed. So I used my points to go see it, and I must say. I think it definitely is a little better than how it comes across in the ad. The filmmaking is definitely solid. The film creates some fairly tense moments, even though it's one of those films where you sort of have an idea as to how it will likely end. It is a fairly straightforward and simple film for sure. However it is well made, and the script is definitely not as unintelligently written as most Hollywood films these days. The dialogue is perhaps a little harsh for some, but that actually also helps this film build the decent amount of tension that it needs to work reasonably well. I definitely don't regret going to see it on the big screen. For many people, this will be worth a watch for sure.I think Mel may have taken this project in order to help fund his own passion projects, and why not? They definitely made a decent little film out of this in my view. In fact, I'd say it's a fairly good date movie if you all can handle some creepy dialogue and a little bit of gore.What is also refreshing about this script, is that even though a female has a major role in the film. The script doesn't enter into any of these overly naive and ridiculous political narratives that so many other Hollywood films these days do. If I see another one of those films, I'm going to be sick right in the theatre. So look out people.6.5/10.",

The first\nenvironment shot, that moose, the officers entering the scene. Insanely bad first few minutes for a film directed by Mel Gibson and starring Mark Wahlberg. I don't want to talk in detail about Winston's lighting or makeup. Just crazy. Cup noodles were the only authentic thing there.Second scene. Also starting with an environmental shot. The compositing for this was best done in After Effects or Nuke Indie.Simply hilarious. The next 60 minutes of the film only took place on the plane. But 60 minutes on a plane without a real story is hard. The only constant storyline was the guy on the phone arranging a date with Madolyn. It really is that bad.The landing scene looked completely different and was probabl just as expensive as everything before.This would have been a flop even as a Netflix series and I can't believe this work of art is seriously being shown in European cinemas.

And not to give anything away, but damn, his character gets taken to task to say the least.Topher Grace is...Topher Grace in this movie. His character really could've been played by any number of actors. The same could be said for the actress who played the FBI agent. But in reality, none of the characters actually required in depth character study or to be standout. It was just a matter of getting actors to sign onto the film who could competently pull off the scenes.So again, it's a decent film overall. I don't think anyone will walk out feeling disappointed or angry about spending their time or money watching it. And as run of the mill as it is, it's still better than what's being nominated for an Academy award this year.",

Wahlberg went through the motions of a bad guy but wasn't convincing. This would be the worst choice of role for him. It seemed it was going to be a comedy action movie with slightly witty dialogues being sprinkled around. Wahlberg shows up and it looked like a conspiracy action movie. That theory turned to be a dud as well. His unceremonious ending just about summarized the movie. The storyline wasn't unique, been seen in dozens of movies. Mob,whistleblower, corrupt official, attempt at assassinating witness you get the picture. Looks like Mel isn't getting anything worthwhile script to work on so decide to make this crap into a movie. Prior to this wreck I had great respect for Mel's work both in front and behind the camera, but this is just bottom of the barrel stuff.",

        "content": "Flight Risk, is a film that had the potential to be a gripping thriller but ultimately falls flat due to a combination of poor storytelling, lackluster performances, and a general sense of predictability. Despite the star power behind it, the movie fails to deliver on its promise of high-stakes tension and instead becomes a forgettable entry in the action-thriller genre.One of the most glaring issues with it, is its uninspired and formulaic plot. The story revolves around a pilot (played by Wahlberg) who becomes embroiled in a dangerous situation while transporting a fugitive. While this premise could have been the foundation for a tense and engaging narrative, the execution is disappointingly bland. The plot unfolds in a predictable manner, with few surprises or twists to keep the audience engaged. The stakes never feel particularly high, and the resolution is both rushed and unsatisfying, leaving viewers with a sense of anticlimax.Mark Wahlberg, who has proven his acting chops in other films, seems to be on autopilot here. His performance lacks the depth and intensity needed to make his character compelling. Instead, he comes across as one-dimensional, with little emotional range or development throughout the film. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with most characters feeling underdeveloped and serving as little more than plot devices. The lack of strong character arcs or meaningful interactions further detracts from the film's overall impact.The direction by Mel Gibson is another weak point. Known for his work in front of and behind the camera, Gibson's efforts here feel uninspired and lack the visceral energy that has characterized some of his previous projects. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of tedium punctuated by brief moments of action that fail to generate any real excitement. The film's attempts at building suspense often fall flat, as the tension is undermined by predictable plot developments and a lack of genuine stakes.The screenplay is equally problematic, plagued by clich√©d dialogue and a lack of originality. The characters frequently spout lines that feel forced and unnatural, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them or become invested in their fates. The film also struggles to balance its tone, veering awkwardly between moments of attempted seriousness and unintentional humor. This tonal inconsistency further detracts from the overall experience, making it hard to take the film seriously.Visually, Flight Risk is equally unremarkable. The cinematography lacks creativity, with few memorable shots or sequences that stand out. The action scenes, which should be the film's highlight, are poorly choreographed and lack the intensity needed to leave a lasting impression. The special effects are serviceable but nothing more, failing to elevate the film or add any sense of spectacle.",

        "content": "Avoid this movie if you have even a basic knowledge of airplanes as you will roll your own eyes right out of your skull. This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a tense bottle episode of a not so great soap opera. Almost the entire movie takes place in the plane which is fine and it can work but the actions the characters take and the dialogue they say while doing those actions makes no sense.Topher Grace is a witness against a mob boss. He gets picked up by a US Marshall in Alaska played by Michelle Dockery who has a troubled past. Do we ever get to see that troubled past no, but Mark Wahlberg apparently knows all about it and uses it towards the end of the film to rile her up into attacking him.There were so many aviation errors and basic laws or physics that were broken in this movie I had difficulty keeping up. Some notable examples were the complete lack of urgency or professionalism from anyone that gets on the radio or phone with the Marshall. The fact that the movie picks and chooses when characters can hear each other in the plane or not hear each other. At one point Marky Mark's character is handcuffed to the back of the plane against the fuselage and claims that he can't be shot because Michelle Dockery's character may miss and hit the fuel tanks. Only problem is the fuel tanks are in the wings. At another point a flare gun is used inside of the plane along with a fire extinguisher both of which would be tremendously hazardous to use in an enclosed space but someone just cracks a window and everything is hunky dory. Later in the movie a gun is fired inside the plane the bullets stop dead in the comically thin front seat with no issue when in reality they would have traveled straight through and into the engine compartment of the airplane. The best part was the ending when the plane is being landed by Michelle Dockerys character. She runs out of fuel short of the runway and yet the prop continues to spin at full speed and she crashes with enough force to tear the plane apart and throw Mark Wahlberg out of the side. Mark Wahlberg proceeds to get up virtually unscathed from the crash and get run over by a fire truck that doesn't even stop or anything after killing a person.The ending is also so unbelievable and cheesy it almost made me want a refund. Topher Grace gets stabbed twice and is inches from death but he is left alone in an ambulance and almost assassinated. Where aree the paramedics that put him in there? No where to be found I guess.I'd say only go see this movie if you want a good laugh. There were moments of almost greatness but it felt like a rushed money grab from Mel and an awfully written story from the writer. Parts of the movie seriously sounded like they were written by ChatGPT. It's watchable but only just barely. 4/10.",

On the one hand, it has inconsistent suspense, has dodgy humour and doesn't truly entertain like an action thriller ought to. On the other hand, the performances are good, the exterior plane shots are convincing and the twisty nature makes it watchable.Mark Wahlberg (amusing accent), Michelle Dockery and Topher Grace are actors that I enjoyed watching here, Grace manages to overcome some cringey dialogue that was (hopefully, for his sake) written for him; the banter isn't great, the more serious stuff he is solid at. Monib Abhat also has iffy comedy, though does make it work more; a mostly voice role helps.Overall, a fine time at the movies. Like last week, I was fortunately able to watch it as part of a double header on the big screen - this time with Steven Soderbergh's 'Presence'. Back-to-back 90 minutes, I'm cool with long run times but sometimes its nice to have films of such a length. For what it's worth, that other flick is the better.",

Flight Risk is a movie that is meant to be something serious but turns out to be a silly ordeal intertwined with those elements. Our cast is essentially three actors trying to make a tale with some heart, suspense, and a good drive toward the fate of an accomplice for the local crime lord. On some levels, the movie accomplishes this better than I had expected, given the absurdity of the plot. It's a movie with better character development, with two of the characters going deeper and connecting far past the initial expectations of the opening scene.The performances are not the best executed, but they are fun and believable at times as they handle the very shaky script that is not to be taken seriously from what I saw with the movie. Dockery is the most serious of the bunch and accomplishes the Crime/Thriller role the best with the focus, seriousness, and agent-like composure she wields professionally, but she also has moments of vulnerability that are authentic and well-written. Grace starts out like another knock-off to That 70's show but then evolves into more as the flight continues to hit turbulence and the fight for survival begins. Despite the serious attempts, though, the movie is drowned out in comedy, to which Wahlberg excels with his corny delivery, odd energy, and that slightly laughable grin he has made his trademark brand.I laughed a lot at this film because of the dialogue and clever bits of humor mixed in; the stretches were balanced enough to make things fun without being too annoying. Once the thrills started, the laughs continued as well from the crazy things they had the plane go through, the actions very unrealistic to the level that it's so bad, it's ironically good. The thrills keep coming, the pace exciting with it, and the story laid out to take the right breaks to expand upon the characters. It's a nice blend and provides much more to the entertainment aspects that impressed me with just how fun it was to see it all come together. Throw in a good set of visuals to make the effects look realistic and you've accomplished yet another fun aspect of the movie to help distract from the ludicrous project Flight Risk is.DISLIKES:\nCheesy\nWahlberg's Character Is Eh\nA Bit Too Comedy\nBetter Story/Twist Execution\nSummary:\nThe movie is cheesy, and you have to be ready to suspend that disbelief to levels that might be annoying to some fans. All the positive things mentioned above help this, but there are still moments that stretch things too much for me to ignore. The comedy does get a bit overbearing at times, feeling like a sitcom in how forced and frequent the jokes are without the full delivery and timing to build it up. Those moments do get a tad stale for me and might be the same for those with a low tolerance for more comedy and less story. The tale has its ups and downs, but I felt it needed a better execution of the story and the \"twists\" that lie with it. Flight Risk needed to be in something other than a plane or have a story taking place during it, like Speed did, to help add more dynamic telling and give us something more than a conveniently designed plane. This is done via the radio, but it still felt strained, with eye-rolling moments that were just too much to believe and swallow down. Throw in the lame use of Wahlberg's character for comedic relief and a visual antagonist, and the story takes further hits from the expectations placed by the trailers. More character development, psychological warfare, and storytelling with him were the biggest things I wanted from this movie for improvement, especially given how well Wahlberg can make a character shine if given the material. It is another case of too much compacted into one setting, and even though the thrills hit at times, they just can't match some better thrillers I've seen in the past.The VERDICT:\nFlight Risk meets many expectations in what the trailers laid out. It's a cheesy movie, full of contrived moments and disbelief to help add artificial thrills to the movie and try to get that entertaining Friday Flick that they love so well. A strong acting game makes the material more fun, with comedic delivery and banter being the primary meat in this sandwich to munch on, with a few vulnerable moments to act as an appetizer. The thrills are enjoyable despite the unrealistic moments, but there was more that could have come together to unleash the full potential of the movie and address the story limitations that a single plane location provides. Still, this pace, the visual effects, and the fun that I had with this movie make it a suitable one to hit the theater to watch and kill some time. My scores for the movie are:Action/Crime/Drama/thriller: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

I left half way through because it was that bad. A very weak script, overacted by the lead, with 2 wooden unbelievable character B listers tagging along for the ride, which was neither tense or exciting. If you are the type of film buff that has to watch every movie then please don't waste your money now, wait til it arrives on sky... just make sure you watch it in bed cos you won't need the cocoa. Have to say though, I agree with other reviewers that Wahlberg's bald head was riveting, definitely the best bit of acting in the whole movie.",

        "content": "\"Flight Risk\" Review - Murder at 3,000 Feet Has Never Been This FunFlight Risk is the kind of movie that makes you laugh, gasp, and reconsider flying altogether. Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot with a side hustle in murder, and Topher Grace is his unlucky passenger who probably wishes he'd just taken a Greyhound.Wahlberg spends the entire movie playing a maniac with a pilot's license, delivering one-liners while throwing people out of moving planes. Grace, meanwhile, is the human embodiment of \"I made a huge mistake,\" trying to survive long enough to testify against mobsters while dodging both assassins and in-flight snacks that probably aren't FAA-approved.The action scenes are ridiculous in the best way-fistfights during turbulence and emergency landings. It's so over-the-top, you'll find yourself rooting for Grace to make it while secretly wondering if Wahlberg could land your next Spirit Airlines flight.Hilarious, chaotic, and weirdly charming for a movie about a killer pilot. If you love absurd action flicks, Flight Risk will have you booking aisle seats just to be safe.",

        "content": "\"Flight Risk\" was a total letdown. I went not with high expectations, but I at least expected a decent movie that could have potentially been very good. However somehow, it managed to dip even lower. The pacing was excruciatingly slow especially the first half, and the dialogue felt like it was straight out of a campy B-movie, which I believe also hindered the performances of the cast. That said, Mark Wahlberg's performance was the best. And seriously, that bald patch on Wahlberg? Talk about dodgy! You could clearly see that patch had been shaved, revealing short stubble.As a huge fan of all Mel Gibson's previous works, an avid admirer of his talent both behind and in front of the camera, and of him as a person, I was genuinely shocked by how poorly this film was executed. Gibson has directed some of my all-time favorites, but \"Flight Risk\" was not only mediocre; it was just plain bad. I can't even scratch the surface of what went wrong.The excessive use of profanity throughout the film was another major letdown, not that it has much influence on my rating, if any. Here's the thing: Mel Gibson and Mark Wahlberg are now known for their Christian beliefs, yet the dialogue was filled with foul language that felt completely out of character for what they stand for. Wahlberg even apologized to the Pope for a number of his past roles, claiming he felt convicted about his choices, yet this film really doesn't reflect any growth or change. Instead, it felt like a missed opportunity for something meaningful and a bad example of what it is to be a \"Christ-follower, not to mention outright hypocritical. As Christ-followers we have the obligations to shine Jesus' light through being an example of what He stands for. I don't see much of a difference in their ways compared to the rest of the world based on watching this.Romans 12:1-2 says:\n\"I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.\"Ephesians 4:29 (AMP) says \"Do not let unwholesome [foul, profane, worthless, vulgar] words ever come out of your mouth, but only such speech as is good for building up others, according to the need and the occasion, so that it will be a blessing TO THOSE WHO HEAR\"2 Tim 2:16:\n\"But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,\"James 1:26 says:\n\"If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless.\"In short, \"Flight Risk\" was a disappointment on many levels. I walked away concerned and very curious to how \"The Resurrection of the Christ\", Gibson's sequel to \"Passion of the Christ\" will turn out. I pray they come to a place of conviction for their actions and hypocrisy, and ultimately aim for change.",

If you want an Oscar winner re-watch Braveheart it's just that simple.Sure it has the feel of a made for streaming movie Whalberg is sort of wasted in his role but the bottom line is I was entertained and sometimes that's more then enough of especially these days.If you don't like Gibson or silly type thrillers skip it. If you can embrace silliness as entertainment then this will get the job done.The ending is also weak but again I had a lot of fun and that's enough for Flight Risk to get a pass.",

        "content": "I left the theaters about 25-30 mins ago and wrote this reviewThe movie isn't as bad as many critics say. I think Wahlberg does a fine job, as smooth and natural on-screen as he always is; and I like the lead actress who plays Agent Harris. The movie essentially takes place in one location (the plane), which might sound dull; but the pacing is well-done. I got reminded of movies like Panic Room and Phone Booth. In between the dueling with Wahlberg's character, the lead actress talks via satellite phone / radio with the US Marshall's office as well as a pilot who guides her: those parts are actually entertaining too. The radio-pilot (named Hasaan) has some charming lines, and the plot thread with the US Marshal's office adds another layer of suspenseThat said -- it's still a very flawed movie. The premise requires large suspension of belief, and the plot follows a safe and predictable route that we've seen hundreds of times. All of the twists in this movie are poor; we can see those twists coming from a mile away. And while I like Walhberg and Dockery in their roles, I think that Topher Grace (the informant character) is not good. He displays some very poor acting at times. His character also inserts far too many comedic lines and moments, which broke up the tone. The movie involves two people trapped in a decrepit plane, surrounded by the desolate and harsh Alaskan mountains, with no pilot to steer the plane; yet somehow, the film atmospherically fails to convey the sense of dread and horror that you'd expectAnd lastly - Wahlberg sports a balding hairstyle to make his character look creepier, I guess. But I thought this detail was poorly done. As soon as his character's toupee falls off, we actually can see that Wahlberg has a perfect hairline; he merely shaved the top of his head. The filmakers should have used some cosmetics to cover his hairline and make his look more realistic5.5/10.",

        "content": "\"Flight Risk\" is advertised as two people - Madolyn, played by Michelle Dockery, and Winston, played by Topher Grace - stuck in an airplane with a mad man: Daryl, portrayed by the one and only Mark Wahlberg. And, to its credit, \"Flight Risk\" delivers what it advertised. However, at the same time, it does not.Directed by Mel Gibson, on paper \"Flight Risk\" seems like it has what it takes to be an effective little thriller; Gibson is a talented actor and director, and a lot of his previous films are quite good, so when I saw the trailer for this film, I admit I was looking forward to it, if nothing else than to see Wahlberg in a role where he gets to portray a villain - a nice change of pace compared to his typical heroic demeanor. And yes, Wahlberg brings his usual A-game as a conniving, slimy, (potentially bisexual?) scum bag who wants nothing more than to tear the two other passengers apart. His menace is really fun to watch, and the first 45 minutes or so of this movie are pretty entertaining; you can tell how much fun Wahlberg is having being the bad guy, and gosh darn it, I was having fun with him! And then \"Flight Risk\" hits some turbulence (see what I did there?).Whether due to the script or questionable creative choices, Gibson makes the choice to have Wahlberg's Daryl spend the majority of the film unconscious - this is \"Flight Risk's\" death knell. While this movie is advertised as Wahlberg harassing, taunting, threatening, and attacking his two fellow passengers as they make haphazard attempts to fly the plane that they do not know how to fly, \"Flight Risk\" is actually about Wahlberg's two fellow passengers as they make haphazard attempts to fly the plane that they do not know how to fly while Wahlberg's character lies unconscious in the back of the plane. \"Surely he wakes up at some point, no?\" you may find yourself asking? Well, the answer is yes! He does wake up. And what does he do upon waking? Not much.Daryl is set up as a relentless talker, one who enjoys the sound of his own voice. And, in alignment with his character, he does continue to utter crass, crude, and threatening lines to his captives. However, there are long periods of time where - incredulously - Daryl stays silent and says nothing as Madolyn and Winston have full blown conversations... almost as if Wahlberg wasn't even in the same place as them anymore during filming. So, what is originally a taut thriller becomes a frankly boring dialogue-heavy film where Wahlberg is clearly not even there anymore. This is an extremely bizarre choice for many reasons, one of which I just mentioned: Wahlberg's character is set up as someone who likes to talk, so why would his character stay silent for minutes at a time? You'd think he wouldn't stop talking if nothing else than to distract his victims from figuring out a way to fly the plane - after all, his goal is to ensure their demise, no matter what.Now, once Wahlberg wakes up again, the film does pick up a little bit, but not too much because, as I mentioned, he doesn't have that much to do or say after his character's initial setup. Sure, it's not like he's out of the movie after the first act, but he might as well be due to how little time is devoted to him; I mean, there were points where I literally forgot that there was a third person in the plane. The film does try to thrill through the prospect of its main characters trying to contact others on radio and cell phone in a desperate attempt to obtain some semblance of direction on how to fly the plane that they found themselves the pilots of. And again, on paper, this sounds like it could be exciting, but it's really not, mainly due to - again - the lack of Wahlberg's villainous presence.I don't know. I really wanted to like this movie - I went to see this with my father, and he seemingly loved it (upon exiting the theatre, he said to me, \"I loved it!\") and thought that it was a heart racing thriller. I very much wanted to echo my father's sentiments, but unfortunately I found myself not exactly bored with this movie, but indifferent toward it. Yes, I found some enjoyment with it here and there in a cheesy B-movie sort of way (and yes, I probably will buy this movie on Blu-Ray and watch it again when I want some very brainless entertainment), but the aspect I enjoyed most about \"Flight Risk\" - Mark Wahlberg as the villain - literally took a back seat for the movie to become a dialogue-heavy drama posing as an action-thriller.",

The snowy, foggy Alaska setting and confined plane interiors create a stress-inducing atmosphere that elevates the suspense.

        "content": "There are often years before Mel Gibson as a director comes up with a film again, but when Gibson comes up with a film, it is often of very high level. Take movies like Braveheart, Apocalypto or Hacksaw Ridge and you will understand what is meant. Now Flight Risk seems to be of a quite different level and a big strange duck in the bite in Mel Gibson's directing career. Seeing the trailer gives you more the feeling that this is a second-rate streaming service film, but this is not something we expect from a director like Mel Gibson of course. Even if we look at the cast, everything seems fine. For example, we see a name like Mark Wahlberg, who usually makes fine films. Also Topher Grace, who will most know from his role as Eric Forman from That '70s Show, and Michelle Dockery, who is known for her role in Downton Abbey.With a playing time that is still less than an hour and a half without the credits, you can already assume that the pace is quite high in the film. The film opens with Winston's arrest and before we know it we are already flying into the air. The time is taken to give the characters a little more depth, but that doesn't really work. In the end, the story is too simple and above all predictable to give the film a little more level. You already know in advance that there is something wrong with pilot Daryl, and soon Winston finds out that Daryl is not the real pilot who should bring the plane to its destination. Madolyn seems a little more naive for a while and even when she sees bloody scratches on Daryl's neck, no light goes on. When they finally find out that Daryl is out to kill Winston and Madolyn, the ridiculousness begins to pile up, but despite that, the film still offers some form of entertainment.In the second half of the movie, all the brakes are released and it must be said that it is quite clever that Gibson still manages to reach the viewers. Especially since most of the film takes place in a small plane with only three people in it. Wahlberg really partially shaved his head for the role, something that was really his own idea for the film. It does provide a somewhat humorous note in the film. Now, by the way, the film lacks nothing in humor and eventually you will be faced with the question of whether you are watching an action movie or a comedy. The film is not really successful, but complete failure is not the case either. Flight Risk is just a snack that probably ended up in theaters through the names of the director and Mark Wahlberg, because if those names were not connected to the film, the film would probably have ended up directly on a streaming service.Flight Risk has become a mediocre work that may entertain, but does not know how to make its mark as action/thriller. Although the film manages to keep its playing time at a narrow hour and a half and the pace is quite high, the film is too predictable and just too many unbelievable ridiculous things happen. The fact that a film like this has ended up in cinemas is guaranteed to have to do with the associated names of Gibson and Wahlberg; without them, this film would certainly not have ended up in theaters. It doesn't get really bad anywhere, but unfortunately the movie is not really worth more than a watch. A trip to the cinema is therefore really unnecessary and it would be better to wait until the film can be watched on a streaming service, and even then it is only questionable whether the film would come into its own better.",

Very grateful nobody was sitting there at the time.As everybody knows, this is Mel's first warmup in the director's chair since Hacksaw Ridge and before tackling the - what will most definitely be controversial - Resurrection movie(s).Flight Risk is a classically perfect, by the numbers, entertaining action film in every sense. I was wishing it was in black and white. I could Imagine the leads being Cagney, Barbara Stanwyck and Peter Lorre as the snitch. Everybody does a good job here, even if the dialogue falls short throughout. Another dialogue pass would have gone a long way in the writing phase. Walberg seems to do the best at making the most of it. But do we re-quote lines from Commando like \"Let off some steam, Bennett!\" because we like Shakespearean hero speak? I think not. So there's that.So, outside of this movie being more at home in another century, it's good. It's the kind of movie where you focus on the rope, a ring, a 73 Winchester, but this time it's a plane.Excellent experience I'd say - for those who love popcorn.Graciously free refills at AMC.

Specifically, hyper-stylized and stretched-out artsy chick flicks.This ain't one of those.This film takes place primarily within the interesting confines of a rickety prop plane, with three troubled characters on two sides of a familiar scenario; a mob informant's impending testimony. The main characters are well-played and colorfully authentic. There are other characters that we only hear but do not see that also play significant roles in the unfolding of the story.Corruption, betrayal, and emotional baggage also make appearances and add elements of suspense and depth to the characters' humanity, and the story overall.The film is fun and entertaining, with some carefree doses of humor, particularly from the human cargo. His character's sarcasm not only contrasts the drama, but also opens the cabin door for a swarthy joker over the radio on one side, and a twisted form of dark psycho-humor from the main antagonist on the other.There are some gripping action scenes with good build and intensity, a couple of which will make you want to make sure that your seatbelts are fastened.The film should hold your attention. It did mine. The setup is quick, the pace is consistent, it is well shot and directed, realistic, and there are twists, turns, and turbulence.Overall, a nice, tight, tense, well-balanced, and originally-set thriller.

The most interesting thing here is Frank Gastambide's character as some kind of villain, very unusual for him. He is not a gangster, not a cop, just some kind of mercenary working for the palaces and tracking down punks. As in some crime movies where robbers pull a heist against a mafia casino and are hunted my mafia goons. I love this Gastambide's role, but I really disllike the romance element here, between Olivier Marchal's daughter - Zo√© and the young father with his daughter. It has nothing to do here, and the kids scenes really annoyed me. Back to Frank Gastambide, he should play in a further Olivier Marchal's film. The acting here is superb, even for supporting roles. But it could not have been grittier. It is tough, with good surprises. There was another thing that annoyed me, pulling a heist, armed robbery, without gloves....

Do this OK fall down that'll be cool. Hey can you jump off that chair. It was that immature a production. Was it made by a 12-year-old? Yuck! Can I get that time back?

        "content": "It's hard not to be a little insulted by Netflix sometimes. They seem to have a very specific type of movie they like to put out time and again and it really is aimed at the lowest level of movie-viewer. This tacky, predictable and safe movie template that they have down and throw out a dozen times a year is just awful to watch and 'Back in Action' is just another one to throw on the trash heap.It was nice to see Cameron Diaz again after 11 years. I always enjoyed her charisma and sass that she was able to bring to a role. Here though she was not her usual self. Whether that was the script or her being a bit rusty I'm not sure. She didn't have any chemistry with Jamie Foxx though whatsoever.Those are two fine actors and they both felt wooden the entire film. Foxx did have some health problems during filming though it is worth noting, so I'm happy to give him a pass. The fact that he completed the film at all is commendable.Also I could've done without the bratty kid characters. Did anyone consider making them likable so that we might care about their fate a little more?Sometimes you can say, turn your brain off and you'll have a good time. With this movie you need to turn your brain off to avoid the frustration of the absurdly stupid script and story, but you're still not going to have a good time if you do. Things like a plane crashing into the side of a mountain and then characters just walking away without a scratch are just the tip of the iceberg. The fun element was severely lacking in this movie.I tried so hard to get into this movie and enjoy the ride but I just couldn't. Mostly I was just bored. A generous 4/10.",

It's a paint-by-numbers template movie with no heart, no originality, and nothing to set it apart from the endless stream of derivative drivel churned out year after year. The plot is a shameless rehash of stories we've seen countless times before, cobbled together with a checklist of clich√©s rather than any genuine effort at storytelling.The characters are flat and one-dimensional, mere cardboard cutouts going through the motions, and the dialogue is so bland and predictable it feels like it was written by an algorithm. Any attempts at emotional depth or cleverness are overshadowed by the film's relentless pandering and lazy reliance on overused tropes.It's almost insulting how this film assumes its audience will settle for mediocrity. Hollywood clearly believes that all it needs to do is slap together some familiar scenes with a fresh cast, add a flashy trailer, and audiences will lap it up. This is cinema at its laziest and most formulaic, a vapid experience designed solely to rake in box office dollars without providing a shred of originality, creativity, or thought.Save your time, your money, and your brain cells. At best, this film might serve as background noise while you scroll through your phone, but even then, it's a stretch. Hollywood needs to stop insulting its audience's intelligence and start taking risks again, because regurgitated content like this does nothing but prove the industry has run out of ideas.",

        "content": "I was hestitant to watch this movie. Sure Jamie and Diaz are fun to watch, but not in a Netflix movie. The movie is about the two of them beging spies. Diaz is pregant so they want to quit their spy lifes.Once having kids growing up as teenagers, the kids think their parents are boring and have their own way of living their lives. The parents past are chasing after them and the kids get to know their parents are highly trained spies and everything ends well for the family.This is just an avegage movie. We don't get to see some new things here. Jamie and Diaz are caught up in fighting scenes. These were highly choreographed. Diaz talks about her mother all the time, so we know that character will be played by Helen Mirren or Glenn Close.The beginning of the movie kind of had a \" True lies\" touch to it. The movie feels very forced. Don't really know why Foxx and Diaz signed up for this. Things that happen feel random and don't really have a bigger meaning in the movie. The bad guy Chuck is helped by a little boy in a dress who is his tech nerd. But that character does not reach a full potential like how Ruby Rose did in John Wick 2.So if you want to waste your time, this movie is just good to do it with while eating a happy meal from the MaccieD. But if you have some taste of movies, skip this one and just go outside and enjoy the fresh air.",

        "title": "It's pure formula through and through, but Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx have fantastic chemistry and elevate the material",
        "content": "15 years after leaving behind their careers as superspies by faking their deaths, Emily (Cameron Diaz) and Matt (Jamie Foxx) have started a family and now live a quiet suburban life with their teenage daughter Alice (McKenna Roberts) and young son Leo (Rylan Jackson) while dealing with parental challenges like teenage rebellion and screentime. After following their daughter to a late night rendezvous at a night club where they use their martial arts training against some aggressive young men, the two are visited by their former handler Chuck (Kyle Chandler) who warns them the video of their fight has gone viral and that both the CIA and arms dealer Gor (Robert Besta) will likely track them down in the hopes of acquiring the ICS, a digital weapon that Matt hid unbeknownst to Emily if in case they ever needed leverage and to keep it from falling in the wrong hands. After Chuck is killed the two flee with their children while dodging assassins and mercenaries as they head to England where the ICS is hidden with Emily's estranged mother Ginny (Glenn Close).Back in Action is the latest star studded genre film from Netflix and comes to us from writers Seth Gordon and Brendan O'Brien the former of whom also directs. The film marks Foxx's fourth collaboration with the streamer following works like Project Power, Day Shift and they very enjoyable They Cloned Tyrone and also marks the first role for Cameron Diaz since 2014's Annie after the actress took a hiatus due to the travel demands of acting. Back in Action doesn't break any new ground when it comes to this kind of high concept action-comedy film, but despite being pure formula it is elevated by the strong chemistry and comedic timing of Foxx and Diaz.Back in Action follows a similar framework you've seen with this type of format which can be traced back to things like True Lies from the 90s or Romancing the Stone and its various immitators of the 80s (like American Dreamer for instance). This kind of format has been used time and time again (This Means War, Killers, The Spy Who Dumped Me, Ghosted, etc.) and if you're familiar with the formula it's very much in play here. The opening sequence involving Emily and Matt infiltrating Gor's mansion to obtain the ICS is actually quite well done and features some good choreography even if the plane crash sequence maybe is a tad overdone. It helps that Diaz and Foxx do have really good chemistry with each other and it's a marked improvement from last year's Argylle that had terrible chemistry between its leads and an overly bloated runtime. The first act after the opening sequence is probably the weakest part of the film with some very on the nose \"generation gap\" humor with Alice and Leo two-dimensional Gen Z and Gen Alpha archetypes whose position is really only to react to the reveal of their parents superspy past without really being fully fleshed characters themselves and it's the kind of thing that feels very \"sitcom\" in its usage of awkward humor. Once the family is forced on the run it adheres pretty closely to the patterns of this kind of formula action comedy but there are some amusing moments especially with Glenn Close as Emily's mother and some good against type stunt casting where the prior roles associated with two actors help make a pretty obvious twist have more weight than you'd expect.Back in Action is not a great movie but it's a decent rental especially when you consider prior spy films from last year like Canary Black and Argylle that didn't work at all. If this were a theatrical film, I'd say it's something you can rent and be reasonably entertained. Take that for what you will.",

It's not meant to be taken too seriously; it's meant to be an enjoyable distraction from the real world for a couple of hours. Sometimes, it's refreshing to set aside logic and simply enjoy the ride. For those who criticize it, maybe it's time to lighten up and embrace the fun. Hollywood might not be in its golden age right now, but at least this movie delivers what so many others fail to-entertainment. It doesn't try to be anything more than it is, and that honesty makes it all the more enjoyable. Sit back, relax, and let yourself be entertained.",

        "content": "I only didn't give 1 star because the first 10 minutes are actually quite good. Good chemistry between Diaz and Foxx, good set up and a really gripping action sequence. But, my recommendation is to turn it off then and not waste the next 90 minutes of your life.For one thing, there is nothing that kills onscreen chemistry between 2 attractive people who are supposedly \"super spies\" than having them interact as a couple with an incredibly bratty teenager who they are afraid of. Who wants to see Diaz practically begging her daughter to like her with the kid rolling her eyes and another young son tied to a phone. Who wants to see Foxx - whose characters on In Living Color would have gone on a long scold with that girl that would have scared her straight - act like he's not even part of the family, let alone a strong dad, and just run away and let Diaz, the mom, try to (incompetently) parent. NOT sexy.Are all screenwriters, producers, directors and actors in Hollywood plagued IRL with kids they can't control and who are just terrible and worse - boring and predictable? Because those seem to be the only character traits any kids in movies have. These people should go out in the rest of the country and interact with families with kids who are competently parented and where the parents don't want to be their kids' friends. Those kids are alright. But, in this movie, the little boy was cute and sweet but the teenager made me not care what happened to her so when, inevitably, she's endangered, I yawned.Then - Glenn Close - Oh my word. What can I say. SO DISAPPOINTING. It's beyond sad to see one of the greatest actors of the last few generations be reduced to a short (she's such a towering presence in most of her films I never realized how short she is), stocky, badly dressed, oversexed \"secret agent\" who is given a \"boyfriend\" who is dumb and ugly that she apparently (but completely implausibly) can't keep her hands off. And, given lines that are uber cringe which even she can't pull off. Sorry, Glenn, but Helen Mirren showed how to do this in Red. This was beneath you. And, the guy who plays her boyfriend, as someone else noted, must be related to someone in production. His screeching behavior was nauseating.Lastly, the plot. Really!? We are supposed to believe that super villians were still after some software key that could unlock everything in the world 15 years after it was lost? Um, do the writers know how fast software evolves? If this was developed 15 years previously but lost, it likely would have taken about 1-2 years for someone to recreate it or develop something similar and better. After all, whoever wrote the software behind the key was presumably still around. And/or, there are other genius software developers, like, EVERYWHERE. Sheesh!In short, NOT recommended.",

Moreover, the on-screen chemistry between Foxx and Diaz is disappointingly weak, leaving their relationship unconvincing and their interactions flat.

        "content": "Aa disappointing entry in the ever-growing sea of formulaic CIA and spy thrillers that have increasingly dominated streaming platforms. Starring Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz, the film offers little more than recycled tropes, underwhelming action sequences, and a humorless attempt at buddy comedy. It is a forgettable, by-the-numbers affair that struggles to justify its existence amidst an over-saturated genre.Foxx, playing a washed-up detective, and Diaz, portraying a reluctant ex-cop dragged back into the field, share a forced chemistry that never feels authentic. Their banter, which is meant to inject some levity into the otherwise cliched plot, falls flat-often cringeworthy and devoid of any sharp wit. The film lazily relies on tired, predictable jokes about mismatched partnerships and over-the-top action, yet neither the thrills nor the laughs ever land with any real impact.The script is perhaps the biggest culprit. The narrative is devoid of fresh ideas, offering yet another derivative tale of government conspiracy, shadowy organizations, and globetrotting escapades. The supposed high stakes feel hollow, as the film never bothers to develop a compelling reason for viewers to care about the outcome. As for the action sequences, they are standard at best-uninspired car chases and shootouts that are choreographed with mechanical precision, lacking any urgency or real tension.In an age where streaming platforms have become dumping grounds for derivative action flicks, Back in Action feels like little more than a calculated attempt to cash in on the success of previous CIA/spy films. It offers nothing new to the genre and showcases none of the wit or creativity needed to elevate it above the mediocrity that defines this kind of content. There's no sense of risk, no emotional investment, and no clever subversion of expectations-just a paint-by-numbers rehashing of everything we've seen before.Even Foxx and Diaz, who should have enough star power to inject some life into this project, can't save it from being the same tired spectacle we've come to expect from these cookie-cutter films. In the end, Back in Action is a lackluster, uninspired affair-a film so devoid of originality that it feels as if it was designed solely to keep the algorithm happy. It's not just disappointing; it's a painfully uninspired experience that leaves no mark and deserves to be quickly forgotten.",

Back in action for a duo that is always a delight to see on screen, and although they do not have a wonderful script in their favour, they do provide moments where they make us happy and entertain us just as their supporting actors do, who in some way contributes to a good pastime.It has all the circumstances to be the new big Netflix franchise, and it has a couple of arguments to give us something more. Clearly, it is not one of those movies that will mark great milestones, but it does manage to be the first big blockbuster of 2025 even if it does not leave everyone happy. It is a Netflix-style movie that is good for a family weekend, at the service of the charisma of a duo that is back to make us spend pleasant moments on screen.Almost 11 years without Cameron Diaz on screen was too much, seeing her again is a real pleasure. Thank you, Netflix, for that, welcome back home my dear Cameron Diaz.",

Fifteen years later with now two children and living a suburban life their past comes back to haunt them when a series of unfortunate events has them on the internet for the world to see. So now they are running from friend and foe trying to protect their family and a piece of technology that could endanger the world. It is a fun movie and one that looks to be gearing up for a sequel. So if that is what you are looking for give this a shot.",

        "content": "Back in Action (2025) is another action blockbuster from Netflix and the gimmick behind this one is that it marks Cameron's Diaz's return to acting after a decade of retirement. Now I don't have the best track record with Netflix and their action blockbusters, but this one is actually one of the better movies they've made.Positives for Back in Action (2025):\nThis movie does a great job with its goal of being a dumb fun action movie. It was great to see Cameron Diaz back in a movie and that element actually helped elevate this movie. The dynamic between Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx was very good and I even liked the two kids as well. I also get some entertainment from seeing Glenn Close joining in on the action. The action sequences are fun enough with some good gunfire and chases. The comedy is decent enough and it works for this movie. And finally, this movie has enough personality to keep me invested in the story.Negatives for Back in Action (2025):\nThis is still a Netflix action blockbuster and it has all the problem present in these movies. The script has the traditional cliches associated with these movies. The villains are very forgettable with a plot twist that I saw coming from a mile away. And finally, this movie is too long for its own good.Overall, Back in Action (2025) is a decent enough action movie from Netflix and I would recommend it to people looking for some background noise.",

        "content": "Ah, Valentine's Day. Love is in the air, chocolate is everywhere, and fights ensue every five minutes. Great holiday.The biggest draw to this movie is likely going to be Ke Huy Quan, beloved 80's kid star and recent Oscar winner. He is clearly giving it his all, both acting- and action-wise, with a performance I can best describe as friendly, making Marvin Gable someone you'd root for no matter what. Everyone else in the movie does well as well, with the other notable standout being Ariana DeBose as Rose. Other than a few lines that feel a bit over-the-top, she brings a fun presence to the movie.The other big sell, the action, is another reason that's worth the price of admission. Director Jonathan Eusebio, known for stunt coordination on several other projects including John Wick, manages to make the fights a joy in every situation. The camera isn't steady all of the time, but unlike most shaky cam, it works in a way to make the fights feel chaotic while still maintaining a clear sense of what is going on. It also helps that there are several unique setpieces to the fights, including the weaponry of choice by Mustafa Shakir's character The Raven.Besides the leads and the action, the story is admittedly very light. While the trailer's hook is interesting, there isn't much going on in the plot save for one minor subplot that isn't expounded upon, but I thought had a neat little payoff for all the little details throughout. It does work to the movie's favor as a quick 80-minute action flick, but those hoping for more substance will undoubtedly be disappointed. The other criticism I have is that there are several moments of handholding throughout. There will be a focus on an object or setpiece, then a character will say something to the effect of \"I can use this\" or \"Ah, I recognize this\" rather than letting the visual cues clue the audience in.If you can look past the empty-calorie story, I recommend this, especially if you're looking for a Valentine's Day date at the movies. It's an easy watch that pairs well with a dinner afterward. Not much else Valentines-themed this month anyway. Unless you like slashers, in which case Heart Eyes may be more up your alley.",

        "title": "I believe I have one issue, It's definitely the plot.",
        "content": "My main issue with this film is the revenge plot. Simple, yes, but boy does it absolutely make no sense. Ke is a former trained assassin and his brother, Knuckles (I swear knuckles is a sonic character), is the head of the faction (unknown what the faction does or is for, just that they launder money). Ke's love interest is someone who worked for his brother and stole money from him during an important job (she was simultaneously set up but also somehow purposefully did it? It was confusing). Knuckles orders Ke to kill her, and if he does, he grants Ke the freedom to leave the faction and live his own life. Ke spares her life and tells her to hide. They both get away with hiding, until the film begins. What is extremely confusing about the plot is that the love interest sends out a bunch of letters and documents of the money laundering crimes (from that specific job) to Knuckles and his crew to taunt them. This sends them on her trail. She seeks out and finds Ke to reunite but also push him to go back to his \"assassin era\" which he has very much expressed he is ashamed of?? She claims she needs his help to get \"her life back\", because she's stuck being a bartender at a strip club. We never find out what this old \"life\" of hers that she wants back looks like. She ditches Ke after failing to convince him to fight with her, so she pushes his limits and walks into the lion's den (Knuckles's territory) knowing Ke would follow her and essentially fight everybody there (including Knuckles). Once Knuckles and his gang are all defeated, the girl reveals that all of the documents she taunted them with at the beginning exposed Knuckles to have betrayed his higher up allies, some Russians from a different, more powerful faction, so the Russians (having already received this info prior) burst in and grab Knuckles and pay her money for the info. Then the film ends with her and Ke kissing and her going back to bartending. The love interest's motivations are extremely confusing to me and quite stupid. She claims to want her old life back, but goes back to bartending at the end of the film? So how did defeating Knuckles help her get her old life back? I also thought it was weird that she constantly claimed to want Ke's help, often pressuring him to return to his old ways (which he expressed explicitly multiple times to have been ashamed of and just desired a normal simple life) and yet the entire time she had already sent all that dirty info on Knuckes to the Russians. So what was the point, then? Why not stay in hiding until the Russians captured Knuckles and then return to that \"old life\" she claimed to want back.",

        "content": "Ever since Ke Huy Quan won the Academy Award, cementing his acting career comeback, I've been in full support of whatever he does. The new action romantic comedy LOVE HURTS is seriously testing that support. Marvin (Ke Huy Quan) is one of the best realtors in town. When his dark and violent past comes back and threatens the new life he's built, he's forced to face it head on. There is so much that doesn't work in this movie. First, the story sucks. Marvin thought that having his face plastered around town was a good way of laying low after betraying his crime boss boba- drinking brother Alvin \"Knuckles\" (Daniel Wu). Marvin's betrayal consisted of saving the life of his love interest Rose (Ariana DeBose), who comes back into his life like a wrecking ball because \"Hiding ain't living\". I have never seen two characters in a romance have less chemistry. I always try and use my big words, but not here: He feels like a \"simp\" and she feels like an a**hole who uses him like a tool. The side characters were a little more interesting and fun, which isn't a good sign. Quan reunites with his GOONIES co-star Sean Astin, who actually has a good scene. Drew Scott (from the Property Brothers) has a funny scene, as does football player Marshawn Lynch. The antagonist has zero character development, which should've been easy to add in, since he's Marvin's estranged brother. The action scenes were not bad, but it felt like they were playing it safe. Even though the movie is 83 minutes long, it still feels too long. LOVE HURTS is a Valentine's Day movie with commitment issues with half-baked subplots and a cookie-cutter ending. Just watch the trailer, that's basically the movie.",

        "title": "Here's the Brutal Truth About Love Hurts...",
        "content": "Love Hurts is a straightforward action film with a touch of drama, but make no mistake-this is a \"one-man army\" kind of movie. It's the type of film that thrives on plot armor, where the protagonist is outnumbered but somehow manages to take down everyone in his path. Is it better than John Wick? Definitely not. Is it better than Nobody? Not really. But does it beat some of Jason Statham's more forgettable action flicks? Surprisingly, yes.The story itself is simple, almost too simple. At 83 minutes (credits included), it knows when to wrap things up without overstaying its welcome. But even with its short runtime, the pacing feels uneven. There's an unbalanced mix of action and drama, with the middle part of the film filled with repetitive dialogues that stretch out the story instead of adding depth. The film had the opportunity to introduce more compelling subplots but chose not to, leaving certain moments feeling dragged out rather than dynamic.One of the biggest frustrations is how the film teases a truly interesting character, only to cut away just when things get exciting. There's a moment where you expect an intense, game-changing sequence, but instead, it's skipped entirely. It becomes a classic case of \"tell, don't show,\" which feels like a missed opportunity.That being said, Ke Huy Quan brings something fresh to the action genre. He's not your typical tall, muscular action star, but he nails his role in a way that feels both cheeky and authentic. He's quick, agile, and entertaining to watch. And while the plot armor is undeniably strong, at least the film acknowledges that his character, Marvin Gable, is human-he takes hits, gets knocked down, and even bleeds. This adds some believability to his fights, making them more engaging.However, Marvin Gable as a character feels a bit two-dimensional. We get glimpses of his past, but not enough to truly understand who he is or why he's being hunted. There's potential for a deeper backstory, but instead of expanding on it, the film keeps circling around the same few details. It feels like it's dragging itself down with repetition rather than moving forward with meaningful character development.Ariana DeBose, on the other hand, brings plenty of energy as his partner-in-crime. She's witty, charming, and completely self-serving in the most entertaining way possible. She's chaotic, but not quite Harley Quinn levels of crazy-more like a playful, opportunistic wildcard. She adds a layer of fun to the film, making her scenes a highlight.As for the action, it's not as gory as John Wick or Nobody, but it's still brutal enough to satisfy action fans. The choreography is slick, yet somewhat goofy-kind of like Kick-Ass, where the fights blend both realism and over-the-top action. Not every hit lands perfectly, not every move is executed flawlessly, and that imperfection actually adds to the charm.The film also tries to introduce a unique element with \"love letters\" as a recurring theme, tying it to a Valentine's vibe. But while the idea is interesting, the execution feels underwhelming. The letters don't add much emotional weight, and instead of feeling special, they come across as just another detail in the film.Verdict: Love Hurts is a quite fun but flawed action film. The performances, especially from Ke Huy Quan and Ariana DeBose, bring life to the story, and the fight sequences are enjoyable in a raw, slightly clumsy way. But the uneven pacing, lack of depth in the protagonist's backstory, and missed opportunities hold it back from being truly great. It's entertaining for what it is, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.",

        "content": "\"Love Hurts\" had promise. At least, the trailer made it seem so. Advertised as a sort of martial arts action/comedy/romance hybrid - starring everyone's favorite Ke Huy Quan (and not to mention the lovely Ariana DeBose), the film looked to be, at the least, a fun little Valentine's Day adventure with some competent, violent fighting. And with its 83 minute runtime? Gosh, \"Love Hurts\" has to be nothing but a lean, fast-paced action extravaganza... right? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is: No. \"Love Hurts\" is a poor film, and it pains me to say that, as I was genuinely looking forward to this. However, within minutes of the movie beginning, I realized that the optimal viewing experience would've been at home rather than on the silver screen.I don't want to waste time talking about the plot (it's practically non-existent) or the acting (everyone does an okay job with the material they have, but virtually all are hamming it up to an absurd degree); instead, I want to jump right into why you're going to see this movie - the action. Is the action in \"Love Hurts\" good? On a technical level, yes. The action itself is filmed well, and you can tell that some real care was put into the choreography. Additionally the camera work is quite good, almost never shaky, and likes to follow the action around in smooth takes and wide angles. The martial arts spectacle at play here can be satisfying if you're into that sort of thing, and there's a third-act fight inside of a home that is genuinely exciting.My issues with the action, however, are twofold. For one, the film just doesn't have enough action in it. For a movie that's only 83 minutes long, there is barely any action at all; you get a little bit in the very beginning of the movie, and then nothing until the final 15 or 20 minutes or so - this was shocking to me, and turned the film into a boring slog where I was sitting there waiting for something - anything - to happen. Secondly, because of the goofy, almost parody-esque tone of the film, the action lacks impact and feels ridiculous. I understand that \"Love Hurts\" wanted to be a fun, breezy date night kind of movie, but the tone was so light and so silly that the action and the violence felt neutered, even with its at times copious amounts of bloodshed. And so, while I could admire the action from a filmmaking perspective, it never really left any impression on me because the over the top tone of the film kept me from getting invested in the violence.The best way I can describe how it felt like to watch \"Love Hurts\" is to say that it's like watching a live-action cartoon. And for some people, that might sound awesome! For me, I would've preferred a bit more of a grounded take that allowed some semblance of seriousness instead of the ridiculous final product. Will you like this? You might find the action enjoyable, but I can't imagine that you'll enjoy how little action there truly is - and how long you have to wait to finally see some.",

Watch that, and you've got pretty much the best (and most comedic) parts of the story. This had the dumbest, most cringe execution of a story I've seen in a while. It tried to be an action comedy, but the comedy didn't work so well most of the time, and the tone between the two was all mismatched with plotlines that were nonsensical and a waste of time in addition to horrific killings that just didn't mix effectively with the rest of the story. Some black comedies work very well - Companion is a perfect example. This wasn't really a black comedy though, and the moments that it tried to be serious in other situations - love between the characters - felt so lame and cringe I was rolling my eyes too many times to count. It's disappointing to have that experience, since Love Hurts had ended up on my list of most anticipated for 2025. So far, this year had been a pleasant start to my big-screen visits (since I hadn't yet gotten pissed or hugely disappointed by any film I've seen at theaters since January 1), but that streak ended with Love Hurts.

Directed by Jonathan Eusebio and starring Ke Huy Quan as Marvin Gable, this film is a complete mess that fails in almost every aspect except for its fight choreography. But good fight scenes don't mean anything when the story, characters, and basic logic are all thrown out the window.The film follows Marvin, a real estate agent who somehow gets tangled up in an assassin plot involving his estranged brother Alvin (Daniel Wu), his supposed love interest Rose (Ariana DeBose), and a series of events so nonsensical that even turning your brain off won't help.A Masterclass in Incompetence\nLet's start with the small, irritating details that immediately tell you the filmmakers didn't care. Right at the beginning, Marvin leaves his garage door wide open when heading to work. When he returns, the garage is magically closed. This kind of careless filmmaking sets the tone for the entire movie-nothing makes sense, and no one involved seems to have been paying attention.Then there's the first fight scene, where Marvin gets a large knife stabbed through his hand, yet continues using it like nothing happened. Minutes later, he gets tackled, stabbed in the shoulder, and thrown out of a window. Does this affect him at all? Nope. He pulls the knife out, leaps over six fences like an Olympic athlete, and escapes completely fine. If the movie had established that Marvin was some kind of superhuman, maybe I'd buy it-but he's just a normal guy. This kind of nonsense takes you right out of the film.The Stupidest Subplot Ever Written\nAt around the 25-minute mark, the movie somehow gets even dumber. Marvin's secretary finds a dead guy in his office and, instead of calling the police like a sane person, calls Marvin's answering machine and leaves a message about it. Then she reads a poem from the dead guy's diary and quits her job. Yes, this is actually what happens.But wait, it gets worse! The \"dead\" guy suddenly wakes up, hears his poem being read, and falls in love with the secretary on the spot. And she falls for him too. This is supposed to be a comedy, but the writing is so absurdly stupid that it doesn't land as humor-it just makes you wonder if anyone in the production even read the script before filming.The Love Story That Doesn't Exist\nFor a movie that's supposed to be about love and action, Love Hurts does a terrible job establishing any believable romance. Marvin and Rose are supposed to be in love, but why? The movie never gives us a reason to care about their relationship. Meanwhile, the film spends more time on the secretary's love life with a would-be assassin than on the actual main couple. By the time Marvin is rushing to \"save\" Rose, it feels like an obligation rather than something meaningful.The Ending - A Merciful Relief\nBy the time we reach the final act, everything is completely off the rails. Marvin's secretary, for no explained reason, suddenly hates him and helps her assassin boyfriend try to kill him. Marvin ends up fighting a group of henchmen in a house he's trying to sell, the assassin kills his own allies for no reason, and Marvin ultimately lets him live because the secretary begs him to. No consequences, no weight-just more stupidity.Then Marvin rushes off to save Rose, fights his brother, wins, and Rose shoots Alvin but doesn't kill him. Instead, she reveals that she \"told the Russians everything,\" and suddenly a group of Russians show up and take Alvin away. Marvin and Rose then drive off into the sunset with a bag full of money.That's it. That's the movie. No emotional payoff, no satisfying character arcs, just a series of random events stitched together with poorly explained motivations and idiotic character decisions.Final Verdict\nThe only redeeming quality in Love Hurts is the fight choreography, which is admittedly well-executed. But no amount of well-shot action can save a movie this brain-dead. The script is laughably bad, the characters are paper-thin, and the entire plot feels like it was thrown together in a single afternoon with no revisions. It's not even the kind of \"so bad it's good\" fun you get from movies like The Room-it's just frustratingly stupid.Love Hurts isn't just a bad movie-it's the kind of film that makes you question if modern filmmakers even care about storytelling anymore. This disaster earns a 1 out of 10, and the only reason it's not a zero is because I've seen worse cinematography in student films.Do yourself a favor: skip this one.",

There were some funny bits, but there were other moments that were meant to be funny, but instead we're a bit cringe. Did not know Sean Astin had a role in this, so we got a nice mini Goonies reunion, which was great. There's even a bit role from one of the Property Brothers. The beginning of the movie and the third act were great, but the middle of the movie was too stilted, with forced exposition. We even heard the thoughts of the characters - with exposition in those thoughts. A lot of those \"thought\" lines were not really even needed. Would have conveyed more with just the actors' facial expressions. This is a a decent, matinee price mindless movie with some excellent fight scenes, if you want a fun 90-minute distraction.",

        "content": "LIKES:\nFun\nFunny\nSome Good Fights\nThe Acting Is Involved\nSome Deeper Meanings\nFun Subplots\nSummary:\nThe synopsis I gave will hopefully set the tone that this movie is not a serious entry into the movie collection by any means. It's goofy, and that goofiness is fun to watch and get lost in for a short amount of time to just give your mind a break. Love Hurts is a comedy before anything else, as it combines a lot of elements that are hilarious to enjoy. Pokes at Martial Arts movies, more jabs at the Valentine empire, and the folly of modern loves. I enjoyed the overdramatic delivery of one character, making every piece of advice comical, while another's somber and poetic tones are strange and time perfectly to be funny rather than disturbing. There are plenty of insults, slapstick humor, and environmental mishaps that feel like a silly version of John Wick, and it worked well on many parts for me in that pure spectacle Eusebio directed it toward achieving. Speaking of fights, the action scenes sometimes nail the choreography to be exciting, impressive, and unique with the kung fu of Bruce Lee meeting the humor of Jackie Chan. Love Hurts made me... well... hurt when you see some of the blows that Quan throws in this movie at the extras. It's violent, it's fast(ish), and feels a bit like a video game with the props and planning that this movie adopted. It leads to a fast and fun pace that keeps your brain numb, and a movie like this is enjoyable when you go in with such a mindset.There are a few deeper elements to the film, the main plot of Marvin's tale holding elements much more in tune with character growth and reflections on life. It's spiritual and almost meditative, a relevant character who is looking for happiness and finding it means that many characters don't quite match up with in other films. Other characters surprisingly have a bit more bite to them as well, not just secondary characters, but tertiary ones whose subplots are cute, entertaining, and offer a little anchor away from the violence that is the main plot. The little dance they do is all in line with the spirit of fun, and the actors all manage to be very fun and immersed in the movie, though a few seem less committed to the characters and don't bring their A-game as they do in other works. Still, Love Hurts surprised me with the expansion into other tributaries to help provide some balance.DISLIKES\nToo Violent/Aggressive Withy Language\nPlot is Clich√©/Predictable\nSubplots are underdeveloped/rushed\nFighting comes off stiff at times\nThe Acting Is Inconsistent\nToo Stupid At Times\nToo Little Time To Juggle Everything\nSummary:\nThe movie is extreme in a lot of ways, though, and the result is a movie being chopped up and a little lacking in many elements to make some of the points fall for me. The acting is, for the most part, appropriate, most of the cast having fun with their parts and just letting their dramatic personalities unfold in manners very appropriate for the film. It's just not consistent, and some of the actors feel a tad dry and uncommitted to the role, only managing to give me convincing performances in the film. The plot is clich√© and predictable, any attempts at twists washed away by the excessive comedy sweeping away the serious plot twists and character developments. The subplots suffer in their length and feel lacking or hastily tied up with a single-shot montage that feels shallow and kind of benign. As for the dialog, well, the movie gets aggressive with the foul language, losing the spice factor for that \"realistic\" angle that so many people seem okay to have. As. If this weren't enough, the movie also starts to run into problems with the action elements for a viewer like me. The film pays homage to the great fights well, but many times, it feels stiff, uncoordinated, and repetitive in the embellishments they took with this film. I don't know how legit the fights are, but Love Hurts seems a bit blocky and forced battles (like the Acolyte) and gets paired with John Wick damage syndrome that loses an edge when you see how much punishment our \"hero\" can take. All of this comes out very stupid and silly at times, leaving me bored and wishing to steer away from the comedy elements to meet closer to the middle or add some more unique and coordinated elements to make up for the clich√©. All-in-all, most of these things could have been improved secondary to having more time, the eighty-two minute run time not giving much wiggle room to keep all these tales and characters in an appropriate balance, in my opinion. About twenty more minutes could have done wonders for this film, or perhaps cleaned up the cast a tad more to not cram so many thin strings into this complex web.The VERDICT\nLove Hurts is another fine edition of the Valentine film parody that is very entertaining to watch. It's simply kung fu in an odd love story, and that ridiculous summary extends into the film's comedic focus with action elements to support the fast-paced film. You'll find plenty of styles to laugh at, alongside some awesome fights that feel closer to real-life anime than the actual real-life anime films we have. The pace is just purely fun, but other plots might stoke the fires of hope and well-being if you pay attention to them. However, this odd combination is not going to win much in the general audience, depending on your tolerance for violence, excessive language, and the amount of stupid humor and aggressive comedy you'll get in the short run time. Love Hurts has a lot of potential, but it's squandered by how short the film is and how many characters/sub-plots they tried to weave together in that time frame. Is it the worst thing to hit theaters? No, but the movie still needs a little more polish, planning, and precision to be worth the full recommendation to see in the theater. It's definitely going to be action lovers and comedy junkies who can't get enough as the niche audience, while the majority will probably get the most at watching at home. My scores for Love Hurts are:\nAction/Comedy: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",

There are things that can be classed as issues, for example the internal monologues are iffy and it's perhaps a tad over sentimental in parts.Those aforementioned things aren't a big deal for me though, like at all. I'd recommend this and would happily revisit it, I'd imagine the rewatchability is pretty high. The pure action is great to watch, there is some top stunt work on show. It's super satisfying to see unfold.Ke Huy Quan brings a strong lead performance, as he is supported competently by Ariana DeBose - who has been extremely busy this last year or two, not that that's a negative as I do enjoy seeing her. Daniel Wu, Marshawn Lynch, Andr√© Eriksen and Sean Astin are decent too.Mustafa Shakir is the best behind Quan/DeBose, probably the best character overall in terms of the look, body language etc. Also, is it just me (most likely) or does he look/sound like he'd be a perfect Scar from 'The Lion King' - I can't unsee it. If Disney ever go 'Cats'-esque shudder, he's their man.It makes little sense and is too silly in certain moments, granted. However, I had the desired amount of fun with it.",

I was looking forward to seeing Ke Huy Quan in his own action film (gotta support a Goonie!) and this film def delivered on creatively choreographed action sequences. The lighting and framing throughout gave the film a bit of a comic book feel. The plot was simple but the writing was a let down. The main antagonist's story wasn't very clear and it relies on a lot of inner monologues to explain what's going on, which was distracting. It hopped around quite a bit and wasn't very cohesive. It felt like lazy writing just to get a Valentine's film out. This film is entirely supported by several key cast members (two of which have Oscar's). But if you go in expecting 1.5 hrs of a camp romp punctuated by impressively choreographed fight scenes, with a couple notable cameos, I think you'll still have fun with this silly, fun movie. I hope KHQ gets more action films as a main character because he's brilliant when he's allowed to shine.",

        "content": "Set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Marvin Gable (Ke Huy Quan) is seemingly a successful realtor who will help you find your dream home. However, following an encounter with an assassin known as the Raven (Mustafa Shakir), Marvin finds his new life under threat from his old one as the re-emergence of his last kill, Rose (Ariana DeBose), whom he didn't actually kill puts him on a collision course with his estranged gangster brother Alvin \"Knuckles\" Gable (Daniel Wu).Love Hurts is the latest genre film from 87North Productions, better known for their production of the John Wick series of films that helped redefine modern action cinema. The film marks Ke Huy Quan's first lead role following his Oscar winning comeback in Everything Everywhere All at Once and while I think Quan is perfectly capable of headlining a film like this, I just wish it were a more interesting one.While Quan doesn't have the richest role as Marvin, I will say that there is sort of a meek charm at watching this small unassuming realtor unleash martial arts fury upon hoards of would be assassins. If Jackie Chan (at his peak anyway) could be described as Buster Keaton with martial arts, Quan's style is more akin to Harold Lloyd where there's a bit more of an edge to the disaster prone hi-jinks. Honestly during the opening 20 minutes I didn't really understand why the movie had been so panned by critics as some of the physical comedy seemed on point and the fight scenes had the typical 87North quality....but then the movie started to lose me. Running at only 87 minutes long the movie isn't unaware of what it is and gets right to the point, but that's kind of part of the problem as there isn't a lot of time spent developing character or setting up the circumstances.When you compare Love Hurts to 87North's other comedic action film Nobody which had a solid and efficient first act establishing the mid-life stagnation of Bob Odenkirk's character that set up effective contrast to the more outlandish elements later on, Love Hurts dives in way too fast and we don't really get a chance to know the characters beyond the surface level. The movie encounters further issues with Ariana DeBose' Rose and the actions taken by her character which the movie tries to frame as being for Marvin's benefit but because we never took time to establish Marvin's life we don't know that and it seems like she's nuking his new life because \"why not?\". The movie per its title also tries to paint itself as a romantic unconventional Valentine's Day film clunkily establishing a romance between Marvin and Rose along with Marshawn Lynch's King and Andre Erisken's Otis discussing marital problems or Marvin secretary Ashley played by Lio Tipton falling for poetic assassin Raven played by Mustafa Shakir and while occasionally there's a sequence that works, most of it just feels limp especially in comparison to 87North's The Fall Guy which mixed action and romantic comedy much more effectively. Even the usually reliable fight work loses integrity in the final act as there's a disappointing number of cuts and close-up shots that make the final fight so underwhelming.Love Hurts isn't without some charms (most of them courtesy of Quan), but the film never fully comes together in alive in a way the marketing promises and it feels like a half-hearted remix of prior 87North productions that did similar things much more successfully. Quan's more than capable of headlining a film like this, I just wish the film itself were better.",

        "content": "Watching freshman director Jonathan Eusebio's \"Love Hurts\" reminded me of those lightweight but exuberant Jackie Chan martial arts adventures with the pint-sized Chan kicking the shenanigans out of assailants twice his size who always outnumber him. Similarly, leading man Ke Huy Quan resembles a middle-aged crazy Chan as he swaps blows with a variety of larger-than-life cretins armed with either guns or knives. Universal Pictures is selling this furiously, fast-paced, 83-minute epic as a Valentine-themed film, but Cupid isn't shooting arrows into the hearts of the hero and heroine. Basically, scenarists Matthew Murray and Josh Stoddard, with Luke Passmore penning a rewrite, deliver the equivalent of \"Nobody\" meets \"John Wick.\" Most of the sporadic but spectacular fight choreography is orchestrated like a martial arts marathon. Usually, the hero winds up battling two or more bad guys at a time. Ke Huy Quan appears to have performed all his own gravity defying stunts. Moreover, the writers do a solid job of aligning our sympathies with his hero, a harmless real estate agent named Martin Gable. Not only are the villains are fiendish intimidating, but they are also dastardly and brandish a variety of firearms and razor-sharp blades. The chief villain, Alvin 'Knuckles' Gable (Daniel Wu of \"New Police Story\"), qualifies as obnoxious with a stone-cold heart who has no qualms about killing innocent bystanders. Remember how \"John Wick\" dispatched some of his adversaries the first \"John Wick\" outing with a number two lead pencil? 'Knuckles' prefers to wield the equivalent of an ordinary straw. You know your waitress gives you with your drinks. The enormity of his villainy occurs when he kills one of the nicer characters just to validate his evil credentials. Interestingly enough, the heroine Rose Carlisle (Ariana DeBose of \"Kraven the Hunter\") precipitates this orgy of violence when she decides to resurrect himself from obscurity to pay back the wicked reprobates who hired our hero to kill her in the first place. The formulaic excuse of a plot that prompts all the splendidly choregraphed combat scenes in everyday, ordinary places, is disposable. It seems, our harmless looking hero was once a world-class assassin who went straight after he faked the death of his girlfriend, Rose, so she could live a peaceful life without repercussions. When the plot unfolds, Rose shows up and decides to shake up everybody. For the record, if you saw \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\" then you've seen Ke Huy Quan but you won't recognize him because he played 'Short Round' the tike who chauffeured around Indy with a block of wood on his shoe so he could reach the gas pedal. You may also remember him as 'Data' in \"The Goonies.\" Clearly, he stand in for Jackie Chan in movies that would have been made to star Chan.",

        "content": "Jonathan Eusebio's Love Hurts is the kind of action-comedy that Hollywood needs more of-smart, stylish, and overflowing with charm. Blending breakneck fight sequences with razor-sharp wit, this film delivers a delightful mix of heart-pounding action and laugh-out-loud moments, anchored by a stellar ensemble cast.At the center of the mayhem is Ke Huy Quan, who shines as Marvin Gable, a reformed assassin turned real estate agent whose past literally comes knocking at his door. Quan brings an effortless blend of charm, physicality, and comedic timing to the role, making Marvin an instantly likable protagonist. Ariana DeBose is equally captivating as Rose, Marvin's former target-turned-long-lost love, injecting the film with an irresistible blend of danger and allure.The supporting cast elevates the film even further. Daniel Wu's ruthless yet magnetic portrayal of Alvin \"Knuckles\" Gable makes for a formidable antagonist, while Mustafa Shakir's smooth but untrustworthy Renny Merlow adds layers of intrigue. However, one of the biggest scene-stealers is Marshawn Lynch, who, as the knife-wielding, poetry-loving Raven, delivers an unexpected comedic performance that lands every time. His dynamic with Kausar Mohammed's hilariously disillusioned assistant Ashley brings a fresh and quirky romance into the mix.Eusebio, best known for his stunt choreography in John Wick and Birds of Prey, makes his directorial debut with a film that showcases his mastery of action. The fight sequences are kinetic and creative, blending gun-fu, brutal hand-to-hand combat, and even a real estate closing that turns into an all-out brawl. The choreography is crisp, inventive, and never overstays its welcome, keeping the film's energy consistently high.Beyond the action, Love Hurts boasts a script filled with sharp dialogue and genuine laughs. The film balances its over-the-top violence with heartfelt moments, never losing sight of its central theme: embracing both the past and the future. The Valentine's Day backdrop adds an ironic touch of romance, with love-whether rekindled, newfound, or hilariously misguided-woven into every plot thread.By the time the final showdown unfolds, Love Hurts has delivered a rollercoaster of adrenaline, humor, and heart. With its pitch-perfect cast, breathtaking action, and unexpectedly sweet moments, this film cements itself as a must-watch for fans of Mr. & Mrs. Smith and The Nice Guys.",

        "content": "Do NOT take the opinions of obviously shallow thinkers offering lame reviews; they must've missed the myriad elements interwoven in this movie: almost every character (that wasn't just a disposable bodyguard like they have an all action movies) has a backstory and significance is placed on each one. Within this one movie, you have a whole bunch of comedy, some sadness, romance, a whole lesson about narcissists and family dynamics, albeit with possibly maybe just a smidgen too much almost surreal violence.I am more than willing to overlook the hyperbole of the fighting and people being able to get up and walk after they have been thrown a car length across the room and up against the wall. After all, wasn't Mel Gibson shot about 17 times in each of the Lethal Weapon movies yet he kept going?I do not want to add any spoilers to this, but I would encourage anyone who enjoys movies such as those Jackie Chan used to do to go see this very entertaining movie. Other than the fighting hyperbole, the only other suggestion for improvement I might add is the age difference between the two main characters. Quan can certainly pass for a man in his early 40s, although he is in his early 50s, but DuBois is 21 years his junior in real life. The characters could pass for possibly having maybe a 14 year age difference, but most of us women are sick of the James Bond routine that casts a much younger female as a main character opposite the older male. Most audiences are horrified if it's the other way around.",

        "content": "This is an amazing movie!! I need more of the main actor in leading roles! My wife and I went to the theaters to specifically support Ke Huy Quan!!!Love Hurts is a remarkable addition to the action-comedy genre, offering an innovative and entertaining take on the classic hitman narrative. Directed by Jonathan Eusebio, renowned for his expertise in stunt coordination in films such as John Wick, this production masterfully combines high-energy action sequences with intelligent humor. The result is a cinematic experience that is both exhilarating and emotionally compelling.At the core of Love Hurts is Marvin Gable, portrayed with great skill by Academy Award winner Ke Huy Quan. Marvin, a former hitman, has abandoned his violent past in favor of a quiet life as a real estate agent in Milwaukee. Quan delivers a nuanced performance, capturing the character's internal conflict as he struggles between his desire for normalcy and the inevitable consequences of his past life. His portrayal is both compelling and multifaceted, solidifying his reputation as a versatile actor.The narrative intensifies with the reappearance of Rose Carlisle, played by the talented Ariana DeBose. Once presumed dead, Rose is not only a former partner-in-crime but also Marvin's past love interest. Her sudden return disrupts his newfound tranquility, bringing with it an urgent mission that threatens to unravel everything he has built. DeBose's performance is striking, balancing mystery and emotional depth with a commanding screen presence. The chemistry between Quan and DeBose is palpable, adding complexity to their relationship and anchoring the film's emotional core.Daniel Wu offers a standout performance as Knuckles Gable, Marvin's crime-lord brother. His portrayal is both menacing and charismatic, making him a formidable antagonist whose influence permeates the film. The sibling rivalry introduces a compelling dynamic to the storyline, delving into themes of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption.A key strength of Love Hurts lies in its action sequences. Jonathan Eusebio's background in stunt coordination is evident in the meticulous choreography of each fight scene. The film employs practical effects and real stunts, reminiscent of classic martial arts cinema, lending authenticity and intensity to the action. Each sequence is expertly crafted to keep audiences engaged and on edge.The screenplay is equally impressive, skillfully blending humor with action. The dialogue is sharp and well-timed, ensuring that comedic elements complement rather than overshadow the film's gripping narrative. The cast's comedic timing, particularly that of Quan and DeBose, enhances the film's charm, making it both an action-packed spectacle and a genuinely humorous experience.Further enriching the film is a strong supporting cast, including Marshawn Lynch and Mustafa Shakir, whose portrayals of eccentric hitmen add additional layers of humor and intrigue. Their performances contribute to the vibrancy of Love Hurts, making it a film full of energy and depth.Visually, the film is striking. The cinematography effectively captures the contrasting worlds of Milwaukee's suburban tranquility and its chaotic underworld, reinforcing the duality of Marvin's existence. The film's aesthetic choices enhance its thematic depth and overall impact.The musical score by Dominic Lewis deserves special recognition. The soundtrack perfectly aligns with the film's tone, seamlessly transitioning between high-intensity sequences and more introspective moments. The music adds emotional resonance, further elevating the viewing experience.In conclusion, Love Hurts stands out as an exceptional film within its genre. With compelling performances, masterful direction, and a flawless balance of action and humor, it presents a refreshing and engaging cinematic experience. The film effectively explores themes of past regrets, love's complexities, and the lengths one will go to protect what matters most. Love Hurts is an essential viewing for fans of action-packed storytelling infused with depth and humor.",

Its perfectly paced always keeping the viewer in engaged and at the edge of your seat while white knuckle-ing.This actor studied and emulated a squirrels movements to earn him an Oscar for 'Everywhere all at once'. Here, the fights scenes are filmed and choreographed flawlessly, creating the most dazzling fight sequences. The soundtrack is also superb and enriches the film especially at the perfect moments.The voice narratives also give it a unique feature providing context and enriching the storyline. If you're looking for an arthouse A24 film, this is not for you, as it seems the case in most of the reviews. Honestly I feel sad that they missed the point and the point is very simplistic: it's a action/rom-com. Nothing more nothing less. Most of the love story is portrayed in fight exchanges but it only adds a refreshing new layer. What's even more impressive is that this is a directorial debut and you would never know it.The premise isn't original but it's captured and told in an original way. The whole cast only adds to the immersion.'Knuckles' delivers a charismatic menacing balancing act that delivers with ultimate satisfaction, ultimately.Ravens character was just phenomenal! The two star crossed lovers chemistry literally bleeds on screen. Its not a 10 but a score of 5.4 is vastly criminal. Its a true solid 9. I have no doubt this will lead to a highly anticipated sequel. Just take it for what it's meant to be: a high octane action movie with romance sprinkled on top meant to deliver spectacular fun. Which it more than succeeds. Don't take it serious or be swayed by the negative reviews. If you focus on all the positive reviews, you'll notice they all share this general consensus. Its very gory and violent. As I mentioned earlier, this Oscar winner mimicked a squirrel. Imagine what he does emulating a hit man assassin trying his best to keep his inner monster at bay until Rose comes back unleashing it.Your welcome!",

Ke plays a realtor that just won realtor of the year. He loves his job but his past comes back to haunt him. Sean is his boss and friend. In his former life, Ke was an enforcer for Daniel, his brother, and was ordered to kill Ariana. But Ke couldn't do it-he fell in love with her-and wanted to quit the business and become a realtor so he faked her death and began selling houses. Ariana disappeared for a while but decided to come back and that's when life changed again for Ke as he has to fight all the different enforcers that Daniel now sends after Ariana. There are lots of martial arts fights and other assorted weapons-mostly weapons with blades-used in the battles and even a little love is in the air during all of the shenanigans. Drew Scott-Property Brothers-makes a funny cameo as a fellow realtor that knows martial arts, too.It's rated R for strong bloody violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 23 minutes.I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",

It borders on cartoonish.Also can we stop with this trend of casting old and unathletic actors to play these action roles. You could argue against me with John Wick and Mission Impossible, but those are veteran action stars and have been in those specific roles for 10 or 20 years.

You simply cannot help but love this guy. Sadly, while he's doing all he can, he feels like a complete standout and in a different movie.When he's on screen, I'm kinda at peace. Unfortunately, the horrible editing generally steals us away from him in lieu of characters we absolutely don't care about and pretty much hate. It hurts even more when they read their jokes as flat as if that was their 110th take.Stop me if you've heard this one: Top assassin leaves profession after one last job and now lives a quiet, suburban life until...they pull him back in! Will he choose the correct path or back to the life he desperately wanted to leave? Huh. So hard to predict.Yes, I groaned so many times (mostly to myself so not to disturb the very few people around me during the opening weekend) and when I left the theatre, I immediately spewed my hate for this awful experience. And yet, I still granted it 3/10 stars because of both Quan and *some* of the action.It all started off great. Though Quan isn't young, he did channel a young Jackie Chan with his fun, improvised fighting. And then...it all went downhill. Each of the few remaining action scenes got sillier and sillier and you truly must suspend all disbelief by the film's end.And don't get me started on his terrible love interest of which the actors had absolute zero chemistry. As mentioned, the characters are terrible, but I believe she takes the cake. I don't think I could've hated her and her convoluted backstory more.Heck, even the villain was as bland as could be. As cute as he was, that actor either couldn't act or didn't know how to bring any spark or fun to his plight.I really, really wanted to see this and loved the trailers.

Seeing an actor of his caliber take center stage in an action-driven role is not just refreshing but necessary in an industry that has long overlooked talents like his.

My girlfriend enjoyed the movie somehow, but she enjoys cheesy. This was loaded with cheddar. I enjoyed myself at moments, other parts of it I was dying at how stupid of an idea it was. I'm not sure what audience they were aiming for, but it wasn't for the masses. I would not recommend wasting your time to see this movie unless you love cheesy.Watched at AMC on 2-19-2025 with Nicole.",

It doesn't out stay it's welcome and is very well paced. The fight scenes are good, if not ridiculous at times, but not in a bad way.There were a few issues I was not crazy about.

Each time I tried to watch a movie with the slap head Michael Youn, I left after a few minutes.

It will be a shock, far more cruel than a Chinese torture, the absolute sadistic refinement that you may imagine. So, if you really have nothing else to do, escape from this crap at all costs; and choose THE BEE KEEPER or UNDER SIEGE - the Cook - instead THE GARDENER. JCVD is not a deception, he is just himself.

        "content": "JCVD is aging and obviously he can't deliver the action pack movies he once did, but this movie surprised me when it comes to action. There is a fair share and altough some are obviously body doubles well hidden by camera angles and fast cuts (still a lot more bearable than Steven Seagal's last fews), it entertained me well in that departement. The fights are also bloody and violent.That said, the story and the humor it try to portrait is so ...weird ! French is my first language, but i am from Quebec, so even tough i had no issue understanding everything in the native french language, some of the jokes really didn't land. That said a few did. Got to give credit where credit is due.I think the major issue is the actor portraying Sergio, the familly dad who is under attack. He is such a caricature i doubt anyone would really behave like this in real life. While a few of his lines or the situations he end up in did land, a lot didn't. And at times i rolled my eyes a bit wanting to yell \"Shut the F up !\" at him. Maybe it was the goal as it was a bit of an ongoing joke that he talked too much and Van Damme too less.In conclusion this is basically a french \"Die Hard\" but almost as a spoof. The story is really just a pitch to have a movie, as the \"list\" is barely explained beside the minimal stuff to have a movie.Want to see JCVD as a man in his 70s killing dudes violently with gardener's tools? Then you may enjoy that movie. But if you ain't into the weird French humor you may find the story/characters very unsettling.Hard to really give a rating to this one. I enjoyed the action, i enjoyed Van Damme, i laugh a few times, but i rolled my eyes a few more. Yeah well 6 out of 10 seem fair.After Darkness of Men i had very little hope for Van Damme flicks but this one gave me back trust that he can still do entertaining action, even if his age obviously do show.",

        "title": "A tense thriller hindered by an underdeveloped plot",
        "content": "Le jardinier (2025), directed by David Charhon, is a political thriller that follows Serge, a man burdened with a state secret, and his family as they find themselves on a government death list. Along with their gardener Leo, they attempt to devise a plan to survive, all while being hunted by forces beyond their control. While the premise offers a thrilling setup full of tension and intrigue, the film struggles to fully capitalize on its potential.The performances, while competent, don't fully resonate with the stakes of the story. The cast, including the lead actor, delivers their roles effectively, but the emotional depth required to truly engage the audience is lacking. The characters, particularly Serge, feel one-dimensional, and the relationships between them fail to develop in a way that could heighten the emotional impact of their dangerous situation.The film's pacing is another issue. The suspense builds at a steady pace, but the plot often feels disjointed, as if key moments are rushed or underexplored. The intrigue of the government conspiracy and the tension of the family's survival are present but fail to fully engage the viewer due to the lack of significant twists or character development. The screenplay, written by Charhon, Vincent De Brus, and S√©bastien Fechner, keeps the story moving, but it often relies on genre clich√©s that diminish the film's originality.Visually, the film has a polished look, but the cinematography lacks the style and energy needed to elevate the suspense. There are moments of tension, but the film doesn't fully lean into its potential for creating an immersive, high-stakes atmosphere. Instead, the tension often fizzles out before reaching a satisfying climax.While Le jardinier has a strong premise and offers some moments of excitement, its lack of emotional depth and reliance on predictable thriller tropes make it difficult to fully invest in the characters and their journey. It's a film that could have been far more engaging with stronger character development and a more intricate plot.Rating: 4/10. A tense thriller with a solid premise, but hindered by underdeveloped characters, pacing issues, and a lack of emotional depth.",

The level of comedy would maybe mildly amuse my 5 year old niece at some points, but even that is a maybe.

The second is that, when viewed from a modern standpoint, it can feel overly cringeworthy and a bit outdated. So rather than focusing on whether it's good or bad, it's more about reliving the feeling of classic action films. While there are plenty of action scenes, Van Damme's moments aren't as thrilling as before. Maybe it's because of his age, but his action sequences often rely on clever camera angles, and in some scenes, the stunt doubles are very noticeable. On the bright side, the film's music score brings back that old-school action vibe, and the cinematography is also a strong point.

The script was poorly written, and Mohanlal was barely on screen for the entire first half - maybe 15-20 minutes in the 2nd half. His portrayal of Abram doesn't come close to the impact Stephen had.That forest fight scene? Felt like a typical Telugu mass masala scene trying way too hard to impress - super cringe. Tovino's transformation wasn't convincing at all, and Manju Warrier's performance felt robotic. I felt like another sagar alias Jacky movieThe only plus was the technical making, but even that couldn't save the overall poor execution.",

This is supposed to be his film, but he barely has any impactful moments. As a fan, I wanted to see more of him, but instead, the film disappointed me.Good music, good bgm.There was so much hype surrounding Empuraan, and honestly, it does not live up to it.

But, Empuraan is just a disappointment of what it could have been.If you loved Lucifer, avoid this. Don't expect the same level of brilliance here.",

        "content": "**The visuals and story building are way too strong and good for anything but an Indian Cinema. Must watch!****L2E: EMPURAAN** is a cinematic triumph that takes storytelling and visual spectacle to a whole new level. As a sequel to *Lucifer*, this film builds upon its predecessor with remarkable finesse, expanding the world of Stephen Nedumpally while crafting a gripping narrative that demands full attention. From the very first frame, *Empuraan* makes it clear that it is not just another mass entertainer-it's a well-thought-out, layered film that leans into strong world-building, a thrilling narrative, and high-quality visuals.### **The Strength of Storytelling and World-Building**\nOne of the film's biggest strengths is its storytelling. Unlike *Lucifer*, which relied heavily on mass appeal and elevation sequences, *Empuraan* takes its time to craft a more intricate, expansive world. Prithviraj Sukumaran, as a director, has meticulously built a layered story that doesn't just revolve around its protagonist but also around a much larger scheme of power, politics, and crime. The screenplay is tighter, more engaging, and filled with moments that keep the audience invested.The political conspiracies, international ties, and deeper dive into the underworld make this film much more than just a standard action thriller. There are no unnecessary diversions, and every scene contributes meaningfully to the plot, which makes the story highly immersive. Unlike typical commercial films that lean on action-packed sequences with little logic, *Empuraan* takes the route of controlled storytelling, making sure every thread has its purpose.### **Visual Brilliance and Technical Mastery**\nThe cinematography and visual effects in *Empuraan* are nothing short of spectacular. The film carries an international feel, with breathtakingly well-shot sequences that elevate the grandeur of the story. Sujith Vaassudev's cinematography captures the scale of the film beautifully, whether it's the high-octane action sequences or the subtle, dialogue-driven moments.The color grading, frame composition, and use of lighting make each scene visually striking. It doesn't look like a typical Indian action film but rather something on par with international productions. The action sequences, too, are masterfully choreographed, making them realistic yet stylish. The film never looks overdone or gimmicky, which is a major win for its execution.### **A Film That Lives Up to the Hype (Purely as a Film, Not as a Star Vehicle)**\nA common concern with heavily hyped films is whether they live up to expectations. *Empuraan* does. However, it does so as a *film* rather than a *fan service product*. Unlike many sequels that merely capitalize on the success of their predecessors, this movie justifies its existence by offering something fresh. It is intense, well-paced, and delivers a rewarding experience for those who appreciate strong filmmaking.This is where it differs from its reception among Mohanlal and Prithviraj fans. While many expected a mass-loaded spectacle with Mohanlal in the center of everything, the film instead focuses on a detailed, well-written story that doesn't entirely revolve around just one or two characters. This makes *Empuraan* a much stronger film but might leave some hardcore fans wishing for more hero elevation sequences.### **The Biggest Flaw: Limited Screen Time for Mohanlal and Prithviraj**\nIf there's one aspect that might leave audiences divided, it is the lack of screentime for Mohanlal and Prithviraj. Given that *Lucifer* established Stephen Nedumpally (aka Khureshi-Ab'ram) as a larger-than-life figure, many expected him to dominate the sequel with the same kind of mass presence. However, *Empuraan* takes a different approach. Instead of treating Mohanlal's character as an all-powerful force, the film distributes its focus across multiple characters and events.For a well-crafted story, this is a positive, as it allows for a more balanced and intricate plot. But for fans expecting a full-blown Mohanlal show, it might feel underwhelming. Even Prithviraj, despite being the director, doesn't take much screentime for himself, making this film more about the story than the star power.### **Final Verdict**\nDespite some drawbacks in terms of screentime for the leads, *L2E: EMPURAAN* is a masterfully crafted film that delivers in terms of storytelling, world-building, and technical brilliance. It's not just a Malayalam film with a superstar in the lead-it's a well-made, ambitious cinematic experience that stands tall in Indian cinema.If you're expecting a traditional mass entertainer filled with elevation scenes, this might not entirely satisfy you. But if you're looking for a well-directed, well-written, and visually stunning film that respects its audience's intelligence, *Empuraan* is a must-watch.",

Prithviraj had a nice 15 minutes I think and the last duo fight was just superb. Then the main villain, I feel like I lhave seen him somewhere but can't remember. Jerome flynn did an amazing job and I think Andrea too did a wonderful job. She was stunning in her introduction .I am waiting for part 3 maybe in next 5 years I hope.

The story further explores whether this fallen angel will survive his war against the Jihadi groups, International Crime Nexus & Drug cartels from swallowing God's own Country and on how he exert influence on the political landscape of Kerala.Murali Gopi has scripted the story well enough to accommodate and intertwine the story in the international terrains while being rooted to God's own Country. Prithviraj has excelled in bringing out Mohanlal in the most epic and stylish avatar like never before with slow motion and good BGM's. This can be termed as the best tribute a fanboy director can give to his idol on the reels. Prithviraj has brilliantly portrayed some sequences on screen in a way better than when it is was put into words. The first half stands superior storywise where as the latter half of the movie lost traction and felt like a usual revenge drama towards the end. Topnotch making but the final music felt like a medium to appeal and attract Bollywood audience.Mohanlal made a subtle performance just by his looks and stance. Abhimanyu Singh,Sukant Goel,Manju Warrier,Nandu,Karthikeya Dev,Eriq Ebouaney,Andrea Tivadar,Jerome Flynn and Kishore made impressive performances.Exceptional Cinematography by Sujith Vasudev especially the night visuals and wide angle shots in the foreign landscape. Deepak Dev's BGM's in the intro portions were stunning. Hats off to the Production designer Mohandas in precisely putting the director's vision onto the screen.A larger than life visual marvel in Malayalam pulled off in a grandeur scale with epic performances and top-notch production quality makes it a must watch on big screens.",

        "content": "I was always skeptical about how good a sequel to Lucifer which goes international can get, and the trailers made me feel like it would be a technically solid but overall okay film, and with that thought this film met my expectations.The technical side is incredibly done. The ambition behind this film is huge. Switching between international dealings with British intelligence, cartel faceoffs in Africa and the Middle East, the politics in Kerala, and riots in North India, it should still feel like the same movie. In terms of writing, there's so much more to be desired, but the technical side is where they compensate the most. The coloring was well done to make that consistent feel to all of it by giving a larger-than-life cinematic feel which also made some of the actor's skin feel AI-generated but I won't really complain about it considering what they were trying to do. The lighting on the other hand is what worked the best for me. The use of shadows, silhouettes, etc was so pleasing to see but the writing and music didn't step up to make those scenes more impactful.The movie felt really long, there were a lot of things that felt repeated, some from the previous part and some in this same movie itself. A lot of stuff in the first half just felt very predictable and the stuff that is meant to be intriguing simply felt flat. They really tried to compensate for it firstly by incredible production quality and making, but along with that they also used real-life incidents as well as parallels with so many important political milestones. But the most hilarious attempts were the constant not at all subtle imageries like the \"Ls\" throughout the movie. There are so many other imageries here that are so on the face that it loses all the intrigue that they were able to create in Lucifer where it was subtle.I was a bit bored in the first half because of how flat it felt, but the second half was really entertaining to me. Even though it still felt overlong, the action sequences were fun and the build-up to them was also pretty good. Manju Warrier's arc was well done which may be the only character with a proper character arc in this movie, unlike Lucifer. Surprisingly Antony's cameo was damn well too. I can't believe how well he was presented here.Overall, even though there were so many things that didn't work in this for me and it's not as good as Lucifer which itself wasn't as great to me as it was to a lot of people, this was still fun to watch. The production quality and a few scenes that worked really well, as well as watching Mohanlal and Prithviraj fighting together made this worth it for me.",

With its gripping narrative, power-packed performances, and visually stunning execution, Empuraan cements itself as one of the finest action dramas in recent times.A Masterclass in StorytellingOne of the biggest strengths of Empuraan is its storytelling. Prithviraj Sukumaran, known for his sharp vision as a director, delivers a film that is not only engaging but also layered with depth and intensity. The screenplay is meticulously crafted, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats throughout. Every twist and turn adds more intrigue to the plot, making it an immersive experience.Mohanlal, reprising his role as Stephen Nedumpally, aka Khureshi-Ab'ram, brings unmatched charisma and depth to the character.

The film dives deeper into his past, unraveling mysteries and secrets that add more weight to his journey. Fans of Lucifer will be thrilled to see how the character evolves, making Empuraan an even more intense experience.Top-Notch Action and VisualsFrom the very first frame, Empuraan makes it clear that it is designed for a grand cinematic experience. The action sequences are breathtaking, executed with precision and flair. Every fight, chase, and confrontation is choreographed to perfection, making it a visual treat for action lovers.

It felt cluttered with unnecessary elements, many of which didn't add any real value to the narrative. One of the biggest disappointments was Mohanlal's portrayal of the character Abraham. His performance lacked the depth and expression we've come to expect from him, especially when compared to his iconic role as Stephen. The character of Abraham came across as flat and unimpactful, leaving fans longing for the familiar charisma and emotional depth that Stephen brought to the screen.Additionally, the movie was bogged down by an excessive number of characters who seemed irrelevant to the plot. Their presence detracted from the main story and weakened the overall impact of the film.

Jathin Ramdas, the son of PKR and the Chief Minister of Kerala, has strayed far from his father's principles. As the saying goes, \"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Aligning himself with a religious party, he plans to exploit Kerala-just like any CM in a typical political thriller. But where is Stephen Nedumpally? The man who once introduced Jathin to IUF and Kerala's political game must now step in to save God's Own Country. Will he succeed? That forms the core of the story.Director Prithviraj Sukumaran has once again delivered a stylish and visually striking film, showcasing Mohanlal in all his mass glory with well-executed slow-motion shots and a powerful background score. However, one can't help but feel that Lalettan deserved more screen time.The antagonist, Bhajrangi Bhai, is introduced as a menacing force in his flashback sequences, but unfortunately, this intensity isn't sustained in the second half, making his character feel somewhat underwhelming. Prithviraj himself gets ample screen time and, as expected, delivers a strong performance.Overall, L2: Empuraan is a solid sequel that delivers stylish action, political drama, and mass moments.

        "content": "After all the bells and hype, the grand reveals, the gossip, the record-breaking bookings... the movie turned out exactly how I discreetly knew it would. But hey, there was a sliver of hope-after all, Prithviraj has been on a roll lately, almost like he cracked the formula for making a great movie. Well, I stand corrected.Let's start with the most glaring issue: the plot-if you can even call it that. Even the most die-hard fans would have a tough time pretending it has any complexity or substance. It felt like something ChatGPT could cook up in an hour, but worse. The only time it seemed like it had any structure or direction was in the first 20-30 minutes when it actually looked like it might deliver on its promise with tactics, mission briefings etc. There was an air of professionalism you'd expect from people at this level. But that illusion shattered the moment Kureshi made his grand entrance. From then on, any hope for a compelling story was buried under an avalanche of slow-mo shots, sunglasses, overcoats and the same BGM that kept playing over and over again. But I guess that's what at least half the audience came for, so hey, maybe they got their money's worth. Maybe a little too much, considering slow-mo sequences make up roughly a quarter of the movie.The film is basically an average male power fantasy, with just enough moral authority sprinkled in to keep things respectable. I can't help but laugh at the idea of glorifying underworld warlords while conveniently drawing the line at narcotics-because, of course, gold smuggling is all rainbows and sunshine, right? So our hero takes on a drug lord, fakes his death, and dramatically returns within 20 minutes (I won't even bother with a spoiler warning-anyone could've seen this coming). Zayeed gets his revenge after a series of painfully predictable 'twists,' spoiled from the very beginning of the movie, and then, just when you thought it was over, the long-awaited reveal of the Triad leader happens. *Cue the dramatic music.*Now, let's talk about the dialogues. Oh. My. Days. Murali Gopy, maybe consider a career as the next Shakespeare instead of a screenwriter? Every line out of Abraam's mouth is an exercise in self-praise and dramatic elevation, a certified cringe-fest masquerading as *punch dialogues*, more like a punch in the gut of someone looking for a realistic conversation. It's like he took biblical quotes, mixed them with old English and Shakespearean theatrics, and thought, \"Yes, this will hit.\" Hint: it doesn't. But oh boy, does he keep trying...I'm still struggling to find a single believable aspect of this movie. The political landscape? Nonsense (The first movie at least made it interesting). The plot armor? Thicker than a medieval fortress. The characters' ability to teleport to \"cool\" locations? Unparalleled. Kuereshi can also apparently turn into Thor and conjure lightning to create the perfect fight ambiance. Priceless. At the very least, with a budget like this, you'd expect some decent fight choreography. But somehow, even that managed to flop.In the end, all I can say is-what a ride. Just not the kind I'd want to take again. But hey, don't mind me, the movie is still a gigantic hit financially, the crew and some hardcore fans goes home happy.",

        "content": "The biggest issue with Empuraan is how it selectively presents power, righteousness, and salvation through an Abrahamic lens, completely sidelining India's vast and diverse spiritual traditions. While Lucifer handled the redemption of a fallen angel in a way that allowed multiple cultural interpretations, its sequel seems heavily biased towards a single perspective\nThe storyline is all over the place. Going by social media posts, it seems like actor-turned-director Prithviraj is surrounded by sycophants, including his own wife. That said, better editing might have salvaged the film to some extent. At times, it almost feels like they were deliberately trolling the very audience that made Lucifer a blockbuster.",

The screenplay, meticulously crafted by Murali Gopy, delves deep into the complexities of Kerala's political landscape, offering a narrative rich with twists and intense moments. The film's ability to intertwine personal vendettas with larger societal issues is commendable, making it not just a mass entertainer but also a thought-provoking piece of art.Mohanlal, reprising his role, delivers a performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing. His portrayal is both powerful and nuanced, capturing the essence of his character's evolution since the events of \"Lucifer.\" His screen presence is electrifying, commanding attention in every scene and reaffirming his status as one of Indian cinema's stalwarts. Prithviraj Sukumaran, apart from his directorial brilliance, shines in his on-screen role, bringing depth and intensity that complements Mohanlal's performance. The camaraderie and tension between their characters add layers to the narrative, making their interactions a highlight of the film.The supporting cast, including Manju Warrier, Tovino Thomas, and Indrajith Sukumaran, deliver stellar performances that elevate the film further. Each character is well-etched, contributing significantly to the storyline and ensuring that no role feels superfluous.Visually, \"Empuraan\" is a feast for the eyes.

        "content": "I had high expectations for L2: Empuraan, especially considering the hype and anticipation surrounding its release. However, after watching the film, I was left feeling disappointed. The movie failed to engage me, and I found myself questioning whether it was worth the time and money I had invested in it. While it had the potential to be a gripping and well-crafted sequel, L2: Empuraan ultimately fell short in several key areas, making it difficult for me to recommend it to others.One of the major issues I had with the film was its lack of engagement. A movie of this scale should captivate its audience with a compelling narrative, well-developed characters, and moments of cinematic brilliance. Unfortunately, L2: Empuraan struggled to keep my attention. The pacing felt uneven, with certain scenes dragging on unnecessarily while others seemed rushed. The storytelling did not flow seamlessly, making it difficult to remain invested in the plot. While I understand that films often take creative liberties, L2: Empuraan failed to create the immersive experience that I had hoped for.Another aspect that contributed to my disappointment was the thematic approach of the movie. It felt as though the film was pushing a particular narrative rather than offering a balanced and nuanced perspective. This lack of objectivity made it difficult to appreciate the story without feeling like it was trying to influence the audience in a specific direction. While every film has underlying messages and themes, L2: Empuraan seemed to prioritize its agenda over organic storytelling, which detracted from the overall experience. For those who prefer a movie that presents a more impartial or thought-provoking exploration of its themes, this film might not be the best choice.Additionally, the character development in L2: Empuraan left much to be desired. While some characters had intriguing setups, their arcs did not feel fully realized. There was a lack of depth in the way certain key figures were portrayed, making it difficult to connect with them on an emotional level. A well-written film should allow the audience to understand and relate to the characters, but in this case, many of them felt one-dimensional or underdeveloped. This further contributed to the film's inability to leave a lasting impact.The cinematic aspects of the movie, such as cinematography and action sequences, had their moments of brilliance, but they were not enough to salvage the overall experience. There were visually impressive scenes that showcased strong technical execution, but they were not supported by a strong narrative foundation. As a result, even the most well-shot sequences felt hollow, lacking the emotional weight needed to truly resonate with the audience.Another major drawback was the film's length and pacing. While some movies justify their runtime by keeping audiences engaged with compelling storytelling, L2: Empuraan struggled to do so. There were stretches that felt overly prolonged without adding much value to the story, while other key moments felt rushed and underdeveloped. This imbalance in pacing made the experience feel tedious rather than exciting, which is not ideal for a film of this nature.Overall, L2: Empuraan did not meet my expectations. It was an unengaging experience that felt more like a vehicle for pushing a particular viewpoint rather than delivering an entertaining and thought-provoking film. While it had potential and moments of visual appeal, the weak storytelling, lack of character depth, and unbalanced themes ultimately overshadowed any positive aspects. For those looking for a film that offers a well-rounded, captivating experience, L2: Empuraan might not be the best choice. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to those who are seeking a truly engaging and unbiased cinematic experience.Rajappan please put ur sudappi stuff in wastebin :x.",

However, I'm giving it a 7 here because I don't want to see the movie fail-Malayalam cinema is reaching new heights, and I'm proud that Empuraan has already broken records, becoming the most booked movie on BookMyShow. May it continue to break more records!10/10 for the trailer edit-hats off to that one. Loved it.A few things I want to highlight here: I felt that Lucifer had better visuals and color grading-a beautiful blend of black and white with the right composition. Especially the colors of that Stephen/Bimal scene in the beginning. Empuraan lacks such visually appealing scenes.The first half felt a bit slow at times.I watched a lot of Prithviraj/Mohanlal interviews in the past few days, and Prithviraj sir emphasized that, just like in Lucifer, Mohanlal sir would have less screen time to make his character feel harder to reach to. I loved that concept, but the execution didn't work as well.Hats off to Prithviraj and Murali Gopy for the amazing script and for pulling off such a massive film.Some scenes were absolutely on par with Hollywood standards-especially the opening sequence.Comparing this to the previous film, Vivek Oberoi was a charismatic villain-different and top-notch in his acting. This time, however, I felt like the villain casting was typical of a regular action masala movie.I know that writing a review here takes less than five minutes of my time, and judging a film is easy. But executing a film like this takes an immense amount of guts, hard work, determination, and skill.The efforts these people have put in-their blood, sweat, and dedication-is evident on screen.Before watching the film, I had a certain image of the character Khureshi Abraam, and the reality didn't quite match my expectations. The way he talks, walks, looks, and so forth.Also, I felt Mohanlal sir looked far more legendary in his original Lucifer look as Stephen Nedumpally.May the film and project be a huge success which is a dream for many, and may many more directors get such chances to execute such huge films.All the best.",

        "content": "After the phenomenal success of Lucifer, expectations for Empuraan were sky-high. However, what we got instead was a sluggish, self-indulgent sequel that tries too hard to outdo its predecessor but ultimately falls flat.The biggest problem? Empuraan lacks the gripping narrative and tightly packed storytelling that made Lucifer a standout. Instead of building on the intrigue of Stephen Nedumpally's rise, the movie drowns in overcomplicated plotlines, excessive action sequences, and an unnecessary expansion of its universe that feels more like a setup for future installments rather than a solid film on its own.Mohanlal, while still charismatic, is given a script that glorifies his character to the point of absurdity. What made Lucifer thrilling was its balance of mystery and realism, but here, the film turns into a larger-than-life spectacle that seems more concerned with making Prithviraj's cinematic universe feel grand than delivering an engaging story. The supporting cast feels wasted, reduced to mere pawns in a game where only one character truly matters.Moreover, Empuraan leans too much on style over substance. The sleek visuals and high-production value can't mask the lack of emotional depth. The dialogues, instead of being sharp and politically charged like in Lucifer, often feel preachy and forced.While there are moments of brilliance, particularly in the action choreography and cinematography, they aren't enough to justify the film's overlong runtime. What should have been a worthy successor to Lucifer ends up feeling like a classic case of a sequel that tries too hard but delivers too little.Verdict: A visually stunning yet hollow attempt at expanding the Lucifer universe. Fans deserved better.",

Plot is almost hilarious, making it feel like watching a comedy movie. The filmmakers have stretched what could've been a 10 minute short film into a 3 hour feature film, which makes it highly boring to watch at the theatre. Dialogues are highly cliched. The Hindi dialogues look like something straight out of a B grade masala movie. Cinematography adds to the hilariousness of the movie. The camera angles utilised are subpar. Extreme, nauseating violence is shown frequently. Overall a very unwatchable film.",

        "content": "Empuraan is a visually stunning film that pushes the boundaries of Malayalam cinema, but it falls short in terms of storytelling.The movie starts with a violent action sequence, setting the tone for what follows. The Hollywood-style cinematography and fight scenes are something never seen before in Malayalam cinema. The explosion shots are brilliantly executed, adding to the grand scale of the film. However, there are several repeated shots, which make some parts feel stretched.The music, compared to other mass masala films, doesn't quite hit the mark. While the makers took a different approach, it worked well in some places but fell flat in others. The background score elevates certain scenes but lacks the energy needed for a film of this scale.The film cleverly mocks modern politics in Kerala, which adds an interesting layer to the screenplay. The first half keeps the audience engaged by maintaining a sense of mystery. But when it comes to the story, it doesn't feel as strong as expected. There is a lack of a true \"wow factor\" after watching the movie, leaving a slight disappointment.Prithviraj's introduction scene stands out and even feels more impactful than Mohanlal's. Speaking of Mohanlal, his costumes didn't work for me, as they didn't match the larger-than-life character he portrays. Stephan gives me goosebumps but A. K was disappointing.Visually, this is unlike any Malayalam film before. But despite the technical brilliance, the overall film doesn't fully meet expectations. That said, Empuraan is a must-watch in theatres because OTT won't deliver even half of its cinematic impact.",

It also shows the unknown dark regions of international politics but what we should (as an indian) understand is the current pathetic state of india. Another appreciatable element is how strong was the potrayal of women characters. Manju warrier and initial one lady... They have powerful role and dialogues which is a u turn from typical sexually emphasised indian women roles.Technically: one of the best technically made movie from india. Better than all those celebrated movies(specifying technically). Hollywood level action sequence, equipments and shots. Locations and costumes well aligning.Music: not much songs. Never expect a classic bolly masala item song and go for the movie. BGM is aligning with the scene in its most clean way.Clearly a must watch if you could enjoy a movie without any political or fanism blindness. An eyeopener. Not a typical indian type of movie.",

        "content": "L2: Empuraan aspires to be a gripping action thriller, blending personal vengeance with socio-political turmoil. Directed by Prithviraj Sukumaran, the film ambitiously tackles themes of loss, revenge, and political corruption, yet struggles to deliver them with coherence or impact.Set against the harrowing backdrop of the 2002 North Indian riots, the story follows Zayed, a young man whose life is upended by communal violence. His journey entangles him with the elusive Khureshi-Ab'ram and the ruthless Balraj-who later emerges as the powerful and influential Baba Bajrangi within Kerala's volatile political landscape. The film ambitiously straddles multiple genres, incorporating elements of action, crime, and political drama, but ultimately buckles under the weight of its own excesses.The cinematography, rather than elevating the story, actively sabotages it. The relentless overuse of speed-ramping isn't just a questionable choice-it's a disastrous one. Instead of heightening tension, this visual gimmick saps crucial moments of their intensity, reducing what should have been gripping sequences into repetitive, over-stylized monotony. The film drowns in a flood of slow-fast edits, exposing a fundamental failure in visual storytelling. The result? A bloated, exhausting viewing experience that may test the patience of all but the most ardent Mohanlal fans.Adding to its missteps, L2: Empuraan leans heavily on Hindi, with an excessive use of \"saala\" that feels forced and out of place, eroding the film's authenticity. At nearly three hours, the runtime drags, stretching what could have been a taut, compelling thriller into an overlong, indulgent affair. While its ambition is evident, the film would have benefited from tighter editing, more restrained stylistic choices, and a stronger grasp of its linguistic and cultural nuances.For those looking for similar themes handled with more finesse, Shireen Shah (2019) explores the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat riots through a deeply personal lens, while Amu (2005) takes a poignant dive into the scars left by the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Both manage to balance storytelling with social commentary-something L2: Empuraan desperately tries to achieve but ultimately fumbles.",

        "content": "L2 Empuraan (2025) :\nMovie Review -At times, we ponder how to make a bad sequel to a good film. Well, here's L2 Empuraan as a fine and recent illustration of it. Occasionally, people create a good movie and then make a forced sequel to it to earn some good money. That's what L2E is. Directing the legendary Mohanlal is a dream for any prominent director, and then Prithviraj Sukumaran got that chance as a newbie when he made Lucifer (2019). He truly made a good film, and the movie was filled with moments of his fanship towards the superstar. After the huge success of Lucifer, Sukumaran decided to continue the story, but sadly, he and the entire film disappointed big time. If this is how you make a hyped sequel, then it's better not to make it. Not everyone can do what Baahubali 2 (2017) or Drishyam 2 (2021) did. But L2E is a significant failure, man. I mean, forget the critic reviews, but even the masses are going to hate it, and I can see the box office tumbling down after the huge opening already.L2E starts with a foreign operation by an international team as they try to nab Abram Khureshi (Mohanlal). Cut to Zayed Masood's past and the revenge he has been seeking for 23 years. Immediately, cut to Kerala politics, as Jathin Ramdas (Tovino Thomas) has turned bad and has joined forces with the villain, Balraj (Abhimanyu Singh). Cut to Priyadarshini's counterattack, and then there is news of Abram, aka Stephen's, death. As God's own city is under political threat, the devil, Lucifer, must return to save it from evil.L2 Empuraan completely wastes the first half with several plot setups that are far too predictable, even for a child. Mohanlal's entry scene was dull, as it resembles the visuals and style of Lucifer's ending scene. The second half features Mohanlal in one action-packed sequence in dark settings, which remains the best scene in the entire film. The climax fight sequence is similar to the mid-action dramas usually seen in Telugu and Kannada cinema. L2's script has nothing to offer as a sequel to Lucifer, and it doesn't do any justice to its predecessor. It's outdated, tedious, and moreover, stretched to almost 3 hours. It feels so incomplete because you hardly see Mohanlal and Prithviraj in action for barely 20 minutes; then where the hell did those other 145 minutes go?Mohanlal has delivered a decent performance, and for me, it wasn't an acting-driven role. This is about witnessing the massy avatar of the legendary superstar, and he does it right. Sukumaran was underwhelming in the climax and much weaker compared to his performance in Lucifer. Tovino Thomas was quite decent, while Manju Warrier was better this time. Abhimanyu Singh didn't really scare me as an antagonist. Indrajith Sukumaran was fine, and Suraj Venjaramoodu didn't get enough space to be noticed.Regarding the cinematography, this film looks better in IMAX but could have featured those top views and close-ups done better. The widescreen format helps extend the horizon, but only if the director knew how to use it. The best frame in the film remains that \"L\" sign with two metaphorical elements-cross and fire. The background score is another disappointment, but the reuse of the score from the previous film was effective in the forest fight scene. Prithviraj Sukumaran should have scrapped the script written by Murali Gopy in the first place to save himself and his film from this disgrace. L2E is a prime example of how not to make a sequel that will disappoint not only critics but fans as well. Sukumaran's vision was wrong and outdated. Lucifer worked because it was rooted in Kerala, and the Malayalam audience connected to its genuineness, but here L2 completely broke that link and took the film into international affairs and the political turmoil of the state. That's so childish, and so is the film.RATING - 4/10*",

There are parts of the movie where the actor has so much plot armor that we start to wonder if he has superpowers or what. He magically appears wherever the issues are to save and help and even kill people.This movie made characters very black and white, with Kunjacko Boban's character portrayed as some great person no matter what atrocities he does and the group of villains to be worth hate no matter what injustices they also had to face. Overall we can definitely see that the villains are bad but they are also children who were treated very abhorrently by the police force themselves. There is never any mention of that or why that wasn't investigated or addressed. Add that to how Kunjacko's character has done such cruel and emotionally destructive things to his family and others, but he gets away as a hero because of some actions he does later on and the people he hurt ends up apologizing to him- again, because of plot armor.While the idea of the movie has been to play the lead as grey, the way he gets everything in life and does his revenge and gets off scot free did not sit right with me, as it showed a very obvious preference for the director on who the good guy is. It's like, no matter what cruelty the lead actor does, he has to win because he is the lead. And subjects of domestic violence even are brushed under the rug. Honestly a movie that was unenjoyable and the final fight scenes dragged on for 20 minutes with no reason.Disappointing watch overall.",

Then the Saw soundtrack gets plagiarised, and some flashbacks start happening (like those movies) that start stretching logic to breaking point. Throughout the second half, you'll be so distracted by various motives, and how certain characters would have achieved certain things (and found certain people, and why) that all the credibility of the first half starts draining fast. It was all just washing over me by the overlong climax.It's a shame, because without addressing motive with the emotional intelligence of a ten year old, it could have been great (and forty minutes shorter). It's the same \"ugh, really?\" feeling I had in the last act of Spectre. It ends up turning the very real problem of child grooming and abuse into a really ignorant plot device.Also, the divisive framing of these characters into 'villains' and 'hero' leaves a bad taste the more you think about what actually happened. The general idea could have been dealt with so much more intelligently (like The Last Of Us Part 2 for eg.).",

Kunchacko Boban shines as the demoted officer, portraying a man driven by a desperate need for redemption. The film masterfully weaves a complex web of deceit and danger, as he delves into the intricate counterfeit jewelry racket. The pacing is superb, never allowing a moment of respite, and the action sequences are gritty and realistic.What truly elevates this film is its intricate plot, expertly crafted by Shahi Kabir. The twists and turns are genuinely surprising, and the suspense builds with each passing scene. Priyamani's performance adds depth to the narrative, and the supporting cast, including Jagadish and Vishak Nair, complements the lead perfectly. The direction by Jithu Ashraf is taut and assured, creating a palpable sense of tension throughout.The film's climax is where it truly excels. The final act is a masterclass in suspense, delivering a series of shocking revelations that leave you breathless. The ending, in particular, is a powerful punch to the gut, leaving a lasting impression. It's not just a simple resolution; it's a culmination of the film's themes of justice, corruption, and the human cost of both. \"Officer on Duty\" is a must-watch for fans of action thrillers, and a testament to the strength of Malayalam cinema. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, primarily due to its intense thrill and powerful, unforgettable conclusion.",

The rest of the cast performs decently. The action sequences are well-executed. The screenplay reveals the right information at the right time, though the commercial elements slightly detract from the impact. Overall,Officer on Duty is a very good thriller, though its second half follows a formulaic approach.Nevertheless, definitely recommended.OVERALL -6.5/10.",

        "content": "I recently watched Officer on Duty, and I have to say, it's definitely one of the most gripping action thrillers I've seen in a while. The movie follows Harishankar, a police officer who has been demoted but still finds himself caught in a complex investigation that tests both his professional abilities and personal demons. What initially seemed like a straightforward action movie quickly became something much more profound.Kunchacko Boban absolutely nailed the role of Harishankar. The way he portrayed the internal conflict of a man struggling with anger, grief, and duty was so compelling. He made Harishankar's journey feel real and raw, especially as the character battles with his past and confronts his own flaws. There were moments in the film where his performance really moved me, showing just how deeply the role resonated with him.Priyamani, as Harishankar's wife Geetha, gave a strong performance as well. She brought a level of empathy and emotional depth to the film, providing a perfect balance to Boban's intense portrayal of Harishankar. The support she gives to her husband, while also dealing with her own struggles, made their relationship feel believable and heartfelt.The antagonist, played by Vishak Nair, was equally impressive. Christy Savio was menacing and mysterious, and his presence added a lot of tension to the film. The interactions between Harishankar and Christy were some of the most exciting and suspenseful moments in the movie.What I loved most about Officer on Duty was how it combined action with emotional depth. There were enough thrilling sequences to keep you hooked, but at the same time, the movie took the time to explore Harishankar's character and the toll his job takes on him. It made me think a lot about the personal sacrifices that law enforcement officers make and the emotional baggage they often carry.The direction by Jithu Ashraf was top-notch. The pacing was spot-on, and the cinematography really helped set the tone of the film-gritty, intense, and full of suspense. The music was also perfectly placed, amplifying the film's tense moments and emotional beats.In conclusion, Officer on Duty is a must-watch for anyone who loves intense thrillers with strong character development. It's not just about action; it's about the human side of law enforcement, and the price of doing what's right. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend giving it a watch. You won't regret it!",

        "content": "This production, while initially presenting a police officer with a somewhat jarring attitude, ultimately delivers a compelling narrative that delves into the gradual erosion of a person's spirit under the weight of relentless service. The initial \"off\" demeanor, rather than being a flaw, serves as a stark introduction to a character deeply scarred by his experiences. It's a bold choice, refusing to sugarcoat the realities of a profession that can wear down even the most resilient individuals.The strength of the narrative lies in its patient unveiling of the officer's journey. We are not simply presented with a hardened figure; we are invited to witness the accumulation of losses and disillusionment that forged him. The subtle cues, the fleeting expressions, and the gradual shifts in his behavior paint a vivid picture of a man grappling with the moral ambiguities and emotional toll of his work. This slow burn approach allows the audience to understand, if not condone, the character's initial attitude, transforming it from a point of contention to a point of profound empathy.The actors' performances are instrumental in achieving this delicate balance. The lead actor, in particular, navigates the complex emotional terrain with remarkable nuance, conveying the character's internal struggles without resorting to melodrama. The supporting cast, equally adept, provides a rich tapestry of personalities that contribute to the overall authenticity of the world depicted. The director's vision is evident in the seamless integration of these performances, creating a cohesive and compelling ensemble.Furthermore, the production's technical aspects, from cinematography to sound design, are executed with precision, enhancing the immersive experience. The attention to detail in the sets and costumes adds a layer of realism, grounding the story in a tangible world.The narrative itself tackles a timely and relevant theme, addressing a \"new gen\" form of crime that demands our attention. By shedding light on these often-overlooked issues, the production serves as a powerful social commentary, prompting viewers to consider the complexities of modern-day criminality. The story doesn't shy away from the uncomfortable truths, presenting a raw and unflinching portrayal of the darker aspects of society. This commitment to realism is both commendable and necessary, given the urgency of the subject matter.The production's strength lies in its ability to blend character-driven drama with a compelling narrative that resonates with contemporary concerns. It's a testament to the power of storytelling to educate, provoke, and ultimately, inspire reflection. The gradual transformation of the police officer, from a seemingly unsympathetic figure to a deeply human character, is a masterclass in character development.In conclusion, this production is a must-watch for those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant experience. It successfully navigates the complexities of human nature, delivering a powerful message that stays with the audience long after the credits roll. The collaborative efforts of the actors, director, and supporting crew have resulted in a truly remarkable piece of work that deserves widespread recognition. This production is not just entertainment; it's a mirror reflecting the realities of our time.",

The supporting cast(too many names to list) too delivers solid performances, with every character leaving an impact.The background score with pulsating beats keeps us on edge, making the twists and revelations more effective. Whether it's a chase sequence, a suspenseful moment, or the final climax, the music enhances the nail-biting intensity.The climax has to be one of the most satisfying in my recent memory. Just when the climax seems predictable during the long fight sequences towards the end, the director delivers the final punch which feels like a personal victory.Brilliant direction and screenplay, edge of the seat twists and revelations, makes \"Officer on Duty\" a high-intensity thriller - put this one at the top of your watchlist this weekend!",

        "title": "A mainstream, commercial cop thriller cooked with mostly the right ingredients! [+68%]",
        "content": "Shahi Kabir's most mainstream thriller screenplay (..thus far) largely works because of its strong performances and technical efforts. Yes, there are some usual cop movie tropes like the PTSD-induced protagonist, his family eventually coming under threat, rape-revenge-blackmail implementing baddies, and so on. But credit where it's due, this absolutely does NOT feel like a debut director's work. Jithu Ashraf (who also acts in a key role) understands the assignment and navigates the splendidly-paced screenplay in a non-linear manner, making most of the little details matter. Kunchacko Boban pulls off CI Harishankar like a seasoned veteran, letting his rugged body language do most of the heavy lifting. We learn of the character's past in a sufficiently effective flashback, and to some extent, such an evolution contributes to the physicality involved in the latter acts. The stylized gang of baddies, led by Vishak Nair, includes some interesting finds.Roby Varghese Raj (director of Kannur Squad) is cranking the camera here, and his shaky, handheld approach works wonders for the chase and fight sequences. Chaman Chakko is now an editor in high demand, and the way he paces the film and weaves the action in between regular procedural scenes (and toys with contrasting lighting) is excellent. Jakes Bejoy uses a little too much Saw-inspired score, but he succeeds in delivering a solid soundtrack overall; a couple of soundbites are instant earworms.Also, the women in the film (other than the victims) hold their ground. That goes for Priyamani, the two women antagonists, and even the little girl who plays Harishankar's younger daughter. A fight sequence set inside a mortuary is deliciously choreographed and shot. The final act does lose a bit of steam and reminds you of Memories, yet the film manages to keep you on edge. Though somewhat formulaic and predictable in places, I'll recommend Officer on Duty for those who enjoy intense, sporadically violent cop thrillers.",

The story is highly predictive moving in a non linear narrative template culminates all the connected events before the intermission but the way it is layered keeps the audience hooked to the screen and maintains the tempo and mood. The character arc defined to each central characters in the story is perfectly visualised and executed onto the screen by Jithu Ashraf. Shahi and Jithu has triumphed in portraying the other side of the personal and professional lives of the cops in the story instinctively.Kunchacks has given a versatile performance of the cop effortlessly portraying the emotional variance and nuanced layers of the character. Priyamani has made a splendid delivery as a strong bold character and perfectly pulled off the dynamics as the couples. Impressive performances by Jagadeesh,Vishak Nair,Manoj,Vaisakh Sankar,Vishnu,Ramzan,Leya Mammen & Aiswariya Raj.Roby Raj has brilliantly shot the visuals and chase sequences in the movie which is perfectly aligned by Chaman Chakko sustaining the mood of the story. Kudos to Jakes Bejoy for the gripping BGM's and Remesh C P for bringing the variance in colour palette matching the mood of the story. Good efforts by Ronex Xavier in bringing the emotional side of Kunchacks on screen is worth mentioning.A must watch movie on big screens for an emotionally intriguing performances.",

        "content": "Officer On Duty (2025) :\nMovie Review -Malayalam cinema has produced another fine action thriller this year in the form of Officer On Duty. Even though the film isn't truly exceptional, the overall impact is nearly nerve-cracking for someone who has grown bored of typical action thrillers from the South. However, Malayalam cinema is a different ballgame altogether. That said, this film remains very much in the must-watch league for its gripping storytelling and intense narrative.The film opens with the suicide scene of an \"officer on duty,\" followed by the entry of our protagonist, Inspector Harishankar (Kunchacko Boban). He is a bit frustrated, depressed, and has anger issues related to his daughter's tragic past. The storyline soon reveals the POCSO angle and how a gang of young druggists is behind these murders. Hari finds the killers, but they are too powerful and cunning to be stopped. However, a few more murders occur, and Hari almost catches them-but would that be enough?Officer On Duty adheres to the traditional norms of classic action thrillers and unfolds the narrative in a gripping manner. The action scenes occasionally look good but are otherwise too typical and stretched. I don't understand why our action directors lack the creativity to realize that realistic action has nothing to do with tired clich√©s.If killing someone is easier in one second than beating someone for 60 seconds, only for that person to rise again for more beating, then one should use basic sense instead of succumbing to fake cinematic appeal. This film is filled with such foolish scenes, leading me to deduct half a star from the final rating. One can beat someone until the situation necessitates a different conflict, and then drive it toward the conclusion accordingly. Let's stop this nonsense because it's 2025, not 2005.Kunchacko Boban delivers a fine performance in the lead role and makes every second of his presence felt. Priyamani has a small yet important role, and the same goes for Jagadish. Vishak Nair was formidable, Meenakshi Anoop was good in a blink-and-miss cameo, and the rest of the supporting cast performed well.From a technical standpoint, Officer On Duty is a solid production, with cinematography, editing, and a background score creating a significant impact. Jithu Ashraf deserves praise for avoiding a dated mainstream template while addressing a sensitive issue, but he must be criticized for not focusing enough on these sensitive topics, such as POCSO, drugs, youth, officers' mental and physical struggles, and their family problems. With a little smarter vision, could have been a memorable film, but nonetheless, it deserves your viewing time for sure.RATING - 6/10*",

The first half does a decent job of setting up the story with suspenseful moments and character introductions, keeping the audience engaged.

Some moments feel illogical, especially when officers and the hero engage in fights without proper backup or resources, making the action seem forced rather than intense.Despite these flaws, the film redeems itself with a gripping and satisfying climax. The final moments leave a strong impact, making up for the weaker segments and ultimately elevating the viewing experience. Initially, the flaws made it feel like a 3-star movie, but the powerful ending was enough to push it to a solid 5 Star.",

        "content": "I watched Officer On Duty on Netflix after seeing all the excellent feedback online. Yet again, the Malayalam film industry delivers one of the finest thrillers. This is the fourth Malayalam movie I've watched this year that I really liked-all of them thrillers, action-packed, and story-driven. It's amazing to see so many good films coming out in such a short time from the same industry. It really shows the strength of Malayalam cinema-especially the writing and direction.The story revolves around police officer Hari, who starts off investigating a case of counterfeit jewelry. What begins as a seemingly small crime slowly unravels into something much bigger, affecting him both professionally and personally. The way this investigation ties into his personal life, and how it connects to drug rackets, is something best experienced while watching.From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention. It starts with curiosity, introduces Hari and the case, and then gradually builds up with twists and emotional layers. The screenplay connects all the dots beautifully by the climax. If someone narrates the plot in a straight line, it might sound like a simple story. But the way it's told-nonlinear, revealing bits and pieces as it goes-makes it so much more gripping. That's what sets Malayalam films apart. They don't follow the usual Hero-Heroine-Villain formula. Instead, they focus on telling a good story in an engaging way. I really hope they keep making films like this. And I'm happy that this one also did well commercially.The casting is spot-on. Kunchacko Boban, who plays Hari, is fantastic. Known mostly for his romantic roles, he completely transforms here with a calm yet intense performance. He carries the seriousness throughout the film so well-you wouldn't think this genre is new for him. Priyamani, who plays his wife, also fits her role nicely. There's also a group of friends in the film, and their connection to the story is something you should watch unfold. They all acted brilliantly and added a lot of tension and depth.Like the hit film Pani, this movie also touches on the issue of drug use among today's youth-how they're getting pulled into crime for the sake of fun and thrill after getting high. It's a disturbing trend, and the movie handles it without being preachy.The background score by Jakes Bejoy is excellent-some beats even feel Hollywood-style. Roby Varghese Raj's cinematography is brilliant. I watched some behind-the-scenes footage of the chase scenes, and you can clearly see the effort that went into filming those sequences on real locations. The color palette in many scenes also helps set the mood perfectly. The action choreography is also well done-neither too flashy nor too dull.It's hard to believe this is director Jithu Ashraf's debut film. He handles everything with confidence-from the storytelling to maintaining the tone and character consistency. It never feels like a first-time effort.Overall, this is yet another superb film from the Malayalam industry. If you enjoy thrillers, suspense, and well-written stories, you should definitely give this one a try.",

The film's treatment of violence-particularly against women-feels exploitative and excessive, lacking nuance or sensitivity. What begins as a grounded story quickly spirals into unrealistic action sequences, where both the protagonist and the villains seem to gain superhero-like resilience, walking away from brutal attacks with ease. This tonal shift feels jarring and undermines the film's otherwise serious tone. Characters remain emotionally one-dimensional-constantly angry, grim, or brooding-with little emotional range. Adding to the implausibility is the portrayal of the police force, repeatedly outsmarted by a group of teenagers, leaving little credit to the intelligence or competence of law enforcement. The violence is so excessive after a point it feels comical. This was an attempt to do a \"gritty thriller\" but you can do that even without so much in your face gore and violence. The film was however a huge hit in Kerala probably a reflection of the state of the land and peoples mindset.",

I literally fell off my chair. One punch (or was it a kick?) - and emotionally, I was knocked out. Still not over it!This film isn't just a thriller - it's emotionally brutal and intellectually jarring. It makes you reflect. We're all so quick to judge based on surface-level logic and experiences, but this movie shows how the truth, when revealed with patience and depth, can shock you to your core. It's a reminder that logical thinking alone isn't enough - true capability comes from a mix of logic, empathy, patience, sharpness, and understanding.The police force is portrayed in the most grounded, realistic way - no superheroes here. Just raw, intense action. I actually shouted 'Adi!' during the police beatdowns. That's how immersed I was!And don't even get me started on the background score - absolutely top-notch. I raised the volume just to soak in that thrilling BGM during key scenes. Gave me chills.Even the ending doesn't let go - twists till the very last frame.

The protagonist (lead actor) had done a good job of portraying trauma, seriousness and modality on screen. Priyamani has done the usual job of the angry wife.It could have been better if the action was more vigorous and story was unraveled in an innovative way. Thats why its 8 and not 9 or 10.",

        "content": "\"Officer on Duty\" is a gripping Malayalam police thriller directed by Jithu Ashraf, featuring Kunchacko Boban in the lead role as CI Harishankar. The story revolves around a seemingly minor gold chain theft case, which unravels a deeper connection to organized crime and the drug mafia. Harishankar, a dedicated but aggressive officer, is demoted due to a controversial encounter and reassigned to a new station, where he gets entangled in a complex investigation.As he digs deeper, he discovers that the case is linked to a brutal drug network that mercilessly eliminates those who stand against it, including police officers and informants. The film sheds light on how drug abuse destroys young lives and exposes the terrifying reality of the drug mafia, which exploits victims through blackmail and physical and psychological torture. The narrative also highlights how girls are lured into traps, drugged, and manipulated, warning the youth about the dangers of bad company and addiction.Review\"Officer on Duty\" stands out as a family crime thriller that intertwines elements of action, suspense, and social awareness. While the film focuses primarily on Kunchacko Boban's character, Priyamani delivers a commendable performance in a role with limited screen presence.One of the movie's strongest aspects is its realistic portrayal of the drug menace in contemporary society. The brutal tactics of the drug mafia-eliminating those who resist, targeting police officers, and silencing informants-are depicted in a chillingly realistic manner. The film serves as a stark warning about the dangers of substance abuse, particularly among the youth, and stresses the importance of choosing the right friends to avoid falling into these dangerous traps.The screenplay maintains a tight grip on suspense, keeping the audience engaged, while the action sequences and investigative elements are well-executed. The film's emotional weight is also strong, especially in how it portrays the struggles of those who fall into the clutches of the drug world and their families.Final Verdict\"Officer on Duty\" is an intense crime thriller with a strong social message. Though not groundbreaking in its approach, it effectively conveys the devastating consequences of drug abuse and organized crime. Kunchacko Boban delivers a powerful performance, supported by a gripping narrative and impactful action sequences. While the film could have given more depth to Priyamani's character, it remains a compelling watch for those who enjoy investigative thrillers with real-world relevance.",

But their getaway is ruined when a fleet of spy organizations come knocking, guns-a-blazing in search of a 'flight pill,' a MacGuffin hard drive, suspecting the pair of joining rogue spy network Alarum. The pair have to survive fleets of baddies sent by the CIA's Ronald Burbridge (D. W. Moffett), including legendary killer Chester (Sylvester Stallone) and sociopathic operative Orlin (Mike Colter).Alarum first and foremost boasts a talented cast. Scott Eastwood is a strong lead with overall believable action credentials. Stallone has a simple role (and not one too far outside his rhetorical wheelhouse), but he's effective and watchable in it. Colter has been rocking top-shelf roles like Luke Cage and Evil's complex priest, David Acosta, and he's memorable here (with one central caveat, below). Fitzgerald was exceptional in Strange Darling, and she's good here when she is onscreen--though her presence is regrettably limited for much of the film.'Alarum has real action and surprisingly breathtaking events.Sylvester Stallone is an expert and the acting was great and so is the direction.

This is nothing but a disgrace to the film industry, and please, if you spare some time and crave watching a good movie, go to something from the 2010s, as this is just plain out dissapointing. You cannot take some of the most recognizable actors in the world and make such a piece of s**t movie that it makes you not want to watch anything from them ever again. I know I sound like I am biased by the reviews, but trust me, I watched this movie before reading anything about it, and 30 minutes towards the end, I realized that I should have read something, as this movie f'd up my perception of new movies so much that I am disgusted and not even interested in watching anything new that might come out in the next 3 months.

If they can clean up this one with a far better sequel, then it may be worth a watch. C'mon, directors, get with the program and start making epic action movies again and use these classic great actors in roles that suit them rather than attempting to \"make\" them what they were years ago, but obviously are not today, OK?

Absurd? Comic book level nonsense? Can we say drones that can't hit a jeep and fire machine guns instead of missiles?

Sure, I had never heard about it, so I didn't know what I was in for. But I figured an action thriller with the likes of iconic action star Sylvester Stallone and also Scott Eastwood on the cast list couldn't be entirely bad.But I have to say that writer Alexander Vesha seemed to be on thin ice here, because the script was not particularly great. It felt as if the movie never got off of the runway. The movie felt like it was about to speed up and throw a punch or two, but it just never happened. And that made watching \"Alarum\" a somewhat bland viewing experience. I have to admit that I had expected a tad more from Stallone and Eastwood.Despite the fact that the script was subpar, then the acting in the movie was still fair enough. Not really a noteworthy movie for neither Sylvester Stallone or Scott Eastwood, but a fair enough movie.\"Alarum\" was a disappointing action thriller, as it was lacking in both departments. And while I did manage to sit through the movie in its entire 95 minute playtime, I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch it again, as it jus doesn't have the replay value that many of the older Stallone movies have.The action sequences in the movie certainly made it bearable to sit through the entire movie.My rating of director Michael Polish's 2025 action thriller \"Alarum\" lands on a four out of ten stars.",

It's baffling that such a decision was made, given the quality of the cast. That said, if you can look past the completely immersion-breaking \"effects,\" the movie is still somewhat okay. While the plot isn't particularly innovative or groundbreaking, it's serviceable. The real highlight is the solid performances delivered by most of the cast.

All this when he is a spy on the run, yet he waits around for a mercenary team to surround him. When confronted by the mercenary team leader, he stands with his bloody hands behind his back. What mercenary would let someone he doesn't know who may be holding a gun behind his back, and says or does nothing about it? Nothing about what happens to this point or later, makes any sense.The main character grabs a rifle a rifle that had what looks like a 30 round mag and proceeds to fire hundreds of shots. He is initially surrounded, and fights off what seems like several dozen men, by grabbing an automatic weapon, and shooting his way out. They all had weapons pointed at him, and he would have been killed at least a dozen times.There is nothing entertaining, or worth watching in this film.

It felt like the movie was choppy and scenes didn't fit together. The camera work was also all over the place with shaky cams in places where the camera should have been on a tripod or at least a steady cam. The actors appeared to all have fun and not take their roles too seriously.Another major con was that the movie was over the top goofy in places, with the script being so silly it felt like a comedy. This wouldn't be a problem if this was a comedy, but the goofy parts didn't fit with the serious tone of the movie. And the supporting actors acted wooden in scenarios where a real person would freak out or at a minimum be expressive. This just didn't happen. An example is there was a plane crash and everyone stood around looking at it like they were waiting on their lines.Summary:\nThis is a movie that might be okay to watch if you just want to zone out your mind and watch a lot of mindless action.

The plot development lacks logic and coherence; the plot points are simplistic and poorly constructed. Many scenes feel jarring and abrupt, lacking necessary context and explanation. This makes it difficult to understand the characters' motivations and actions, ultimately hindering audience engagement.Furthermore, I was surprised by Sylvester Stallone's limited screen time. Advertised as a key draw, his presence and contribution to the narrative were far less substantial than anticipated, diminishing a major potential highlight of the film. While Scott Eastwood delivered an acceptable performance, it couldn't compensate for the deficiencies in the script and overall plot.While the action sequences were technically well-executed, the sluggish pace and lack of tension rendered them underwhelming. They failed to elevate the viewing experience. In summary, Alarum is a disappointing film. It squandered a talented cast and production resources, resulting in a mediocre, even poor, cinematic experience. I doubt even a director's cut could salvage this film. The special effects also disappointed, appearing rough and dated compared to current standards. The film lacked any memorable or impactful moments.",

Several other issues, to include; a deus ex machina towards the end, endless ammo in gun mags, slow, low-flying drones, lack of regular villagers getting caught in the crossfire, dude under the bed, probably still there; and the spy agency leaders, who had the most boring office space since they moved Milton's desk (Stephen Root) in \"Office Space.\"\nOverall, it is usually nice to see a film made near your hometown to view the places selected.

She is still working for ALARUM, an independent organization that is trying to take down all of the world's spy agencies. The plot starts out bad and gets worse as we discover Lara is guarding a man for some unknown reason. A crashed DEA plane in their backyard gives away Joe's location to his agency. There is a flash drive on the plane that Jow got and everybody wants it. The bad guys (Russians?) are led by a guy with a Nigerian accent. The agency sends Stallone to get the drive and then kill Joe and Lara. Stallone is not trusted so they send assassins after him, and then there was a bad CGI drone. When it was all over, I still have no idea what happened to the drive or the French guy.Guide: F-word. No sex, or nudity.",

Maybe Stallone, Eastwood, and Colter owed someone new producer or director a favor? This movie should have a warning label letting viewers know they are going to be severely disappointed.

The plot is confusing and difficult to follow without clearer context, while the background music further diminishes an already weak experience. The gunfight scenes feel unrealistic, with protagonists defeating entire armies effortlessly, undermining any sense of believability. The acting is average, but the biggest disappointment comes from Sylvester Stallone, who surprisingly agreed to participate in a project of such low quality. All in all, Alarum is a typical example of how low-budget films can fail to deliver on all key elements of good action.",

The CIA director's office is lit up by desk lamps considering they are offered billions of dollars, in the real world. The action sequence is worst. CGI drone drops which is evident to anyone that has played any first person shooter video game. Even after having an amazing actress like Isis the writer(s) decided to execute her.

But with names like Stallone and Eastwood (Scott, not Clint) attached, I dared to have a misplaced sliver of hope for Alarum.The dialogue writing during one of the early scenes is decent, but wow does this film ever go downhill.Alarum is a disjointed mess of a movie. After an initially halfway interesting setup, the plot is reduced to \"bad guys want a flash drive\".There's no connective tissue between the scenes, pacing drags to a halt. And while there is plenty of shooting, all bullet impacts, muzzles and even blood squirts are digital. And laughably badly tracked. The blood squirts are overlays with their own physics and lighting seperate from the rest of the scene.If you can't bother to use squibs for your action movie, then what the hell are you doing?The plot meanders ahead with several double crosses, none of which are interesting, since it's all about nothing. There's one car crash scene that wasn't digital. The soundtrack is awful. It sounds like AI music, like a bad AI remix of the call of duty soundtracks. Some of the action scenes are scored with 90s style breakbeat, others have weird choral passages. It's a mess.Everything about this reeks of laziness, except for Scott Eastwood who at least tries to work with the material. But this is a big step down from his menacing villain in Guy Richie's \"Wrath of Man\".",

The film follows two rogue spies who, after going off-grid and starting a new life together, find their past catching up to them in the most violent way possible. As intelligence agencies close in on their remote hideaway, the tension escalates into a brutal fight for survival.Stallone brings his trademark intensity to the role, proving once again that he thrives in high-octane action thrillers. The film's pacing keeps viewers engaged, with well-executed action sequences and a constant sense of danger. While the plot leans on familiar espionage tropes, the strong performances and sharp direction make it an entertaining watch.\"Alarum\" may not redefine the genre, but it delivers exactly what fans of spy thrillers and Stallone's action legacy crave-a tense, well-crafted ride filled with intrigue, gunfights, and raw survival instincts.",

        "content": "This film has the actors move around in such a stiff and strange way, that I had the impression I was watching an animated film. In fact, I am pretty sure that large portions of this film are actually animated.Another fact that strengthened me in that believe is that the actors look at each other in an unnatural way. In real life, when you talk to someone you will look the other person in the eye but not continuously. You alternate between a straight look and looking off to the side. In this film it is only the direct look, which gives a robotic impression for the characters. Again, I really wonder if the whole film is actually CGI, meaning Stallone and Eastwood only lend their faces and voices to this film.Apart from all that, the story is thin. Rogue (ex) agent is double-crossed by his former employer and also chased by a band of bad guys who appear to be Russian (of course). An assassin-turning-ally is also thrown in the pot, which makes the whole extremely clich√©. And realism was mostly absent; the bad guy shoots the two pilots that are flying him; plane crashes without too much damage; bad guy is nowhere to be seen. Later we find out he jumped out using a parachute we never saw, but the plane was flying way to low for that anyway. The partner of the good guy sees thick billowing smoke from the plane crash from a distance, but when we see the actual wreckage, there is hardly any flames and the plane is hardly broken up, let alone burned.In all fairness, it was entertaining enough so I gave it a six. But I definitely am grateful that I was smart enough not buy a box-office ticket or a pay-per-view for this. That would have been a total waste of money.",

Another example; Scott Eastwood's character comes out of a gaping hole in a building unscathed with no gun even though there is an army of men shooting at him, who only shoot at him AFTER he ducks behind cover. So he walks out of the hole of the front of the building with no gun where all the guys shooting at him suddenly stop, then it cutsto the next scene where he comes from BEHIND those same guys shooting at him and over takes them. Thankfully this is barely 1hour 30minutes, but still too long. If you like the sound of gun fire and cheezy background music this one is for you!",

It's touted as a spy action movie and it's trying, but this had to be one of the worst movies we've watched in a while. Hell, Stallone's previous movie Armor was better than this and that's saying something.Stallone isn't in this movie for very long maybe 10 minutes, if that and he plays a super-assassin who's supposedly a master of poisons. Sounds cool, right? Wrong. He's terrible at his job in every conceivable way. It's disappointing, to say the least.I'm not even going to talk about the plot because (A) it's terrible, and (B) I'd rather go on a tangent.The bad guys in this movie are some of the most incompetent villains to ever grace the screen.For example, our \"heroes\" are trapped in a small building with two automatic shotguns. The bad guys? They've got automatic weapons, surround the building, and outnumber them at least 3 to 1. Do they attack? No, because as one genius says, \"They have heavy artillery.\" Seriously? I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a serious action movie or a comedy, but wow.Another gem: the bad guys have the ex-female spy outnumbered and surrounded. Yet somehow, they still manage to lose because they're...well, terrible. I get it, main characters have plot armor, but come on how am I supposed to take this seriously when the villains seem braindead?And don't even get me started on the drones in the last act. That final action scene has to be the stupidest thing ever put on film. I am convinced the technical advisor if there even was one had no clue how military drones actually work.I cannot recommend this one by any means. Not even for Stallone fans. You'll just be highly, HIGHLY disappointed in his role and the acting here. Save yourself the time and just rewatch Demolition Man or Rambo instead. At least those movies are fun and entertaining.I give this 3 out of 10.",

At just 85 minutes, it delivers non-stop action, intense sequences, and fantastically choreographed fight scenes without a single dull moment.While most of the cast was unfamiliar to me, Luis Alberti and Luis Curiel delivered standout performances, commanding the screen with their presence. No√© Hern√°ndez was equally impressive as the merciless antagonist, making for a compelling villain. Even the supporting actors, despite limited screen time, contributed significantly to the story.Although the plot isn't groundbreaking within the genre, the fast-paced storytelling and tight editing make it an exhilarating watch. The background score enhances the tension as the movie progresses, and the cinematography effectively captures the intensity of the action.If you're in the mood for a high-octane, action-packed thriller, this one is worth watching-no hesitation needed.Final Rating: 7.3/10.",

There's just so much to mock and criticize, I don't even know where to begin. There were a few decent moments, but not nearly enough to make it a good movie. Terrible military tactics of abandoning the high ground was an early mistake that bugged me. Then there was the unnecessary exposure when throwing hand grenades later that got a team member shot that had me scratching my head. Even the conclusion was underwhelming, like, no closure on the corrupt politician when multiple SpecOps team guys get killed?! The movie could've been shorter & longer if that makes sense. Longer would've provided some closure, shorter if they eliminated a lot of the nonsense gunfights. My recommendation is just don't bother watching it.",

        "title": "A Technical Misfire That Fails to Engage",
        "content": "High Rollers is a film that suffers from numerous technical flaws. First, the screenplay structure is weak and disjointed. As the story progresses, logical errors and inconsistencies become increasingly apparent. The film's framework fails to generate the necessary momentum to captivate the audience. The plot's irregularities and implausible developments distract from the experience, making any attempts at drama feel redundant. In particular, the characters' decision-making processes lack clarity, and their dialogue often feels unnatural.Visually, the film doesn't offer anything particularly original. The cinematography is unremarkable, relying on standard, unadventurous techniques. Camera angles are static and conventional, with no visual flair or artistic emphasis in action or suspense sequences. There are times when the camera lingers unnecessarily, which contributes to a lack of energy in the scenes. Furthermore, the close-ups of characters' emotional moments fail to convey any depth, which prevents the audience from forming an emotional connection.The sound design and music are also significant drawbacks. The music chosen for dramatic or tense moments does not align with the atmosphere of the scenes; instead, it feels as though it is directing the audience rather than enhancing the experience. The musical choices are clich√©d and at times rather artificial. The sound effects also feel overly pronounced and unnatural, detracting from the sense of immersion in the world of the film. This further weakens the connection to the characters and their surroundings.The editing, too, leaves much to be desired. The pacing is uneven, with some scenes unnecessarily drawn out, which results in a rather tedious viewing experience. In contrast, other scenes transition abruptly, breaking the flow and continuity of the narrative. A more fluid and coherent editing approach would have helped maintain the film's overall integrity.Lastly, the performances only serve to highlight the film's technical shortcomings. The acting is flat and unconvincing. The characters' emotions and conflicts are poorly conveyed, and this lack of authenticity makes it difficult to care about the events unfolding on screen. Combined with the film's other technical failings, it becomes clear that High Rollers struggles to engage the viewer on an emotional level.In conclusion, High Rollers holds some potential but ultimately falters due to weaknesses in direction, screenplay, cinematography, and sound design. These issues prevent the film from leaving a lasting impression on the audience.",

Most of the time, my predictions are spot on. However, Sky Force is one of the rare films that proved me wrong, especially from a critical perspective.While I may still be correct about its commercial success, my critical view turned out to be completely different. The film is superb. The screenplay is highly engaging and keeps you hooked throughout.After watching the trailer, I thought it would be a cheap knockoff of Fighter (a film I found very ordinary). I assumed it would be another mediocre addition to Akshay Kumar's filmography. But to my surprise, Sky Force turned out to be one of his finest films. It's not just another India-Pakistan war movie; it brings a unique perspective and is executed with finesse.What didn't work:\nThe songs in the first half felt unnecessary and broke the flow of the narrative. Additionally, the overuse of slow-motion sequences, especially in the first half, felt repetitive and diluted their impact. Slow motion should be used sparingly to create a stronger emotional or dramatic effect.Verdict:\nSky Force is a must-watch and stands tall as a remarkable film in its genre. Don't let the trailer mislead you-it's an experience worth having.",

        "content": "Sky Force lands as a respectable Republic Day entertainer, with its ambitious attempt to blend patriotism, history, and drama. Directed by debutants Sandeep Kewlani and Abhishek Anil Kapur, the film draws inspiration from significant events in military history, fictionalizing them to deliver an impactful cinematic experience. The narrative revolves around the Indian Air Force, spotlighting themes of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism. The research into military aircraft dynamics is evident and enhances the film's credibility.For their debut outing, Sandeep Kewlani and Abhishek Anil Kapur deserve praise for choosing an unexplored chapter of military history and presenting it with sincerity. The story has its heart in the right place. While the movie soars high in its second half, a somewhat uneven first half and occasional emotional disconnect hold it back from reaching its full potential. The second half compensates with a gripping investigation into Tabby's disappearance and its compelling buildup. The finale serves as a heartfelt tribute to real-life officers, ending the film on a powerful, patriotic note.Akshay Kumar delivers a commendable performance, shining in both emotional moments and action sequences. He anchors the film with his experience and intensity. Veer Pahariya, making his debut, emerges as the surprise package of the movie. He delivered impressive performance. On the downside, Sara Ali Khan is underutilized. Her character lacks depth, and her chemistry with Pahariya doesn't quite spark. Nimrat Kaur provides a good supporting performance. With limited screentime, Manish Choudhary & Sharad Kelkar delivers a standout performance.The cinematography is a visual treat, capturing air combat sequences with precision and grandeur. The aerial choreography is well-executed. The background score is effective in heightening tension, though Tanishk Bagchi's music is a mixed bag. While the song \"Maaye resonates emotionally, the rest of the soundtrack fails to leave a lasting impression.For those looking for a Republic Day watch with a blend of war history, action, and heartfelt moments, Sky Force is a decent pick that ends on a high, uplifting note. The film pays a moving homage to the bravery and sacrifices of Indian Air Force officers.Direction 3.5/5\nActing 3.5/5\nAction 4/5\nStory 3.5/5\nScreenplay 3/5.",

Despite his remarkable achievements, this hero was largely forgotten by his own country, leaving his story to be rediscovered and retold through this cinematic masterpiece.What sets this movie apart is its unwavering commitment to authenticity. Rather than relying on Hollywood-style pyrotechnics or melodrama, the filmmakers opt for a grounded, realistic approach that honors the pilot's remarkable story. The attention to detail is impressive, from the meticulously recreated aircraft to the nuanced performances that bring the characters to life.At its core, this film is a powerful exploration of patriotism, duty, and the unwavering dedication of India's defense personnel. The pilot's remarkable bravery in the face of overwhelming odds is inspiring, and his selflessness serves as a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by those who serve our nation.One of the most striking aspects of the film is its depiction of the pilot's skill and strategic brilliance. Without resorting to jingoistic nationalism or simplistic heroics, the movie showcases the pilot's exceptional abilities, including his daring maneuver that resulted in the downing of a next-generation fighter plane.The film's success lies in its ability to balance action, drama, and patriotism, creating a narrative that's both thrilling and emotionally resonant. The cinematography is breathtaking, with stunning aerial sequences that put the viewer in the cockpit alongside the pilot.In short, this movie is a masterpiece that deserves to be celebrated by audiences nationwide.

I do understand that it's a patriotic movie but they didn't need to underline it every two minutes with a patriotic dialogue. The commentary in the background made it sound like a documentary and that too not a very good one. I generally feel that Indian filmmakers add too much drama when making a patriotic movie. I personally am more of a fan of movies like Baby or Lakshya where the emphasis is more on the action part of patriotism rather than the speaking part. CGI was good at places though. I also liked the part where they showed real people pictures on whom the movie is based.",

        "content": "\"Sky Force,\" directed by Sandeep Kewlani and Abhishek Anil Kapur, aspires to be a high-flying tribute to the Indian Air Force's valor during the 1965 Indo-Pak war. Unfortunately, it crash-lands due to a combination of preachy dialogues, underdeveloped characters, and a narrative that fails to engage.The film centers on Wing Commander K. O. Ahuja (Akshay Kumar) and his prot√©g√©, T. Krishnan Vijaya, aka Tabby (Veer Pahariya), as they undertake a daring mission against Pakistan's Sargodha airbase. While the premise holds promise, the execution is marred by a script that leans heavily on jingoism and melodrama, diluting the impact of the real-life heroics it seeks to portray.One of the film's most glaring issues is its reliance on clich√©d and overly preachy dialogues. Lines like Ahuja's self-introduction to a Pakistani officer as \"Tera Baap, Hindustan\" come across as forced and undermine the gravity of the narrative. Such attempts at instilling patriotism feel contrived, detracting from the authenticity of the characters' experiences.Character development is another area where \"Sky Force\" falters. Sara Ali Khan's portrayal of Geetavijaya, Tabby's pregnant wife, is disappointingly one-dimensional. Her role is largely confined to that of a worried spouse, offering little depth or agency. The chemistry between her and Pahariya's character is virtually non-existent, making it challenging for the audience to invest emotionally in their relationship.The film also misses the mark in showcasing the camaraderie among the squadron members. While the mentor-mentee relationship between Ahuja and Tabby is somewhat fleshed out, the bond between the other pilots is barely explored. This lack of focus on team dynamics results in a narrative that feels disjointed and fails to capture the essence of brotherhood inherent in military life.In terms of performances, Akshay Kumar delivers a competent portrayal of a seasoned Air Force officer. However, his role offers little that we haven't seen in his previous patriotic outings, rendering his performance predictable and lacking in novelty. Veer Pahariya, in his debut, shows potential but is let down by a script that doesn't allow his character to evolve beyond a stereotypical braveheart.The film's pacing is another detriment. The first half is bogged down with expository sequences that do little to advance the plot or develop the characters. When the narrative does pick up in the second half, it shifts into an investigative mode that, while initially intriguing, becomes predictable and fails to deliver a satisfying payoff.Musically, \"Sky Force\" offers a forgettable soundtrack. The songs feel like obligatory inclusions rather than integral components of the story. A misplaced dance number in the first half is particularly jarring, disrupting the narrative flow and adding little value to the overall film.Visually, while the film attempts to recreate the 1960s era, the production design and special effects fall short. The aerial combat sequences, which should have been the film's highlight, lack the necessary tension and realism, often appearing as subpar CGI spectacles rather than gripping dogfights.In conclusion, \"Sky Force\" is an earnest attempt to honor the bravery of the Indian Air Force but is undermined by its heavy-handed storytelling, shallow characterizations, and uninspired execution. Instead of soaring to cinematic heights, it remains grounded, offering little more than a cursory glance at a pivotal moment in history. For a film that aims to celebrate heroism, \"Sky Force\" regrettably fails to take flight.",

The visuals and the aerial combat sequences were engaging, and the film certainly had a lot of potential. However, the historical inaccuracies and the misrepresentation of real events left a sour taste.The film claims to depict the rivalry between Indian and Pakistani pilots, but it distorts history in ways that seem aimed more at sensationalism than accuracy. The portrayal of Pakistan allegedly shooting down Indian jets appears exaggerated, unsupported by factual evidence, and leans into a narrative designed to vilify rather than inform.It's unfortunate because aviation films can be a powerful medium to showcase the bravery and skill of pilots on both sides, highlighting their human stories rather than indulging in propaganda. A balanced, nuanced approach would have elevated the film, appealing to a broader audience and fostering understanding rather than division.If you're looking for an action movie with dramatic flair, Sky Force delivers in that aspect. But if you value historical authenticity, be prepared to take its claims with a massive grain of salt.",

This movie is not just a gripping tale of courage but also a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by our soldiers, which have often been overlooked.The story sheds light on a shocking reality - how the Indian Government of the time failed to investigate the fate of its own pilot. It's heartbreaking to see that they didn't even initiate their own research into the incident, instead relying on a book written by someone who had already visited Pakistan. This negligence is a glaring reminder of the lack of respect and recognition for the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers.What stands out is how the hero's \"balidan\" (sacrifice) was recognized by an American airplane maker, but not by his own country's leadership. It's a stark contrast that should make the old Indian Government deeply ashamed of their inaction and indifference.The movie is a powerful tribute to the unsung heroes of our nation. It not only stirs patriotic emotions but also serves as a lesson for future generations. Every Indian should watch this film to understand the true meaning of sacrifice and to ensure such neglect is never repeated.\"Skyforce\" is more than a movie - it's a wake-up call.",

Moments of goosebumps, tears were well placed. The 1st half basically focuses on the 1965 war and the second half is its extension & the 2nd half played an important part as its heavily based on sentiments & there the writing team \"Sandeep Kewlani; Aamil Keeyan Khan; Carl Austin & Niren Bhatt\" had beautifully narrated thereby making the movie a worth watch.Talking about the technical aspect, Director duo Sandeep Kewlani - Abhishek Anil Kapur beautifully presented the movie. Aerial action sequences were captivating.

The cinematography and action are undoubtedly highlights, drawing viewers into the intensity of the battlefield.However, the storytelling could have been stronger. Certain significant aspects of the plot were not communicated effectively, which diluted the emotional impact of key moments. For instance, the significance of the last four planes failing to make it to the mission wasn't explained clearly, leaving the second lead character's sacrifice feeling less impactful than it should have been.Despite these shortcomings, the movie benefits from genuine performances and a clear effort to deliver an engaging experience. While not perfect, it's still a good watch and a commendable effort overall.",

        "content": "Overview:\nDon't get it wrong this movie is bad. Interesting true story about a true Indian hero but terrible execution. Akshay Kumar puts in a commendable performance given that his two co-stars, Veer Pahariya and Sara Ali Khan were deadweights in this film. The dialogues were laughably bad.Plot:\nA true story about T. Vijaya, otherwise known as Tabby (Veer Pahariya), an Indian fighter pilot who goes missing in action during the 1965 India-Pakistan war. And the subsequent attempts by his commanding officer Captain Ahuja's (Akshay Kumar) search for the truth about what happened which spans 23 years.Generally, the plot was good for a military movie, and with better execution it would have been a good watch.Script:\nI don't usually include a script section, but the script for this film was so bad that it merits a mention. I understand that in a military film there needs to be a dose of patriotism, which is good by the way, but the dialogues in this movie were so silly and quite frankly just cringey. It was almost like they tested the script on a group of 10-year-olds to see what would sound cool to an audience.Acting:\nThe three main actors gave vastly different performance.Akshay Kumar - a strong showing from the veteran but was let down by a terrible script and even worse co-stars.Veer Pahariya - I went into this with an open mind on this fresh face to Hindi cinema. But I came away not very sure what he did in auditions to merit this role. He has no screen presence, which was sorely needed for a fighter pilot. Additionally, his expressions and tone of voice are the same throughout. He has this constipated intense look that does not go away regardless of the scene. Also, his dancing was quite comical. Not very excited to see more of him.Sara Ali Khan - At this point someone needs to have a quiet word with her and maybe tell her that this isn't the profession for her. Her performances are going from bad to worse and it is getting a little embarrassing. This role didn't have a lot of meat on it for sure, but the expectation would have been that we would have nothing to talk about, instead it is another poor showing from this actress.Effects:\nEffects were ok but I would have expected better than this. Many scenes were video game like.Music:\nMusic was generally good and fit the patriotic nature of the film. It added to what was going on on-screen.Conclusion:\nThere will be a lot of nationalists and paid PR who will give this movie a high rating, but best to not believe them, this movie is bad. If you love Indian military movies, wait for this on OTT. Otherwise, it is best to give this movie a miss.3/10.",

The film stars Akshay Kumar as Wing Commander Om Ahuja and newcomer Veer Pahariya as Squadron Leader TK Vijaya 'Tabby,' both of whom deliver commendable performances that elevate the film to new heights.Akshay Kumar, known for his versatility, shines as Wing Commander Ahuja, portraying a character that is not only dedicated and passionate but also compassionate and empathetic. His performance is a testament to his ability to bring depth and nuance to his roles, making Ahuja a character that audiences can root for.Veer Pahariya, in his debut role, deserves special mention for his portrayal of Tabby. His performance is raw and powerful, capturing the essence of a young officer who is willing to go to any lengths to prove his valor. The chemistry between Akshay and Veer adds an emotional layer to the film, making their journey one that resonates with viewers.The film's depiction of the 1965 Indo-Pak Air War is both thrilling and poignant, with aerial sequences that are among the finest in Indian cinema. The directors have done a remarkable job of balancing the action with the emotional core of the story, ensuring that the audience is not only entertained but also moved by the sacrifices made by the characters.Sky Force is a film that not only pays homage to the unsung heroes of the Indian Air Force but also serves as a reminder of the courage and determination that defines the spirit of the nation.

The aerial dogfights, anti-aircraft fire, and ground strafing scenes are both exhilarating and impressively realistic. The attention to detail in these action scenes is commendable, providing a thrilling experience for viewers.However, there is a notable point of contention regarding the portrayal of the lead characters. Since the movie is based on the true story of Squadron Leader Ajjamada Boppayya Devayya of the Indian Air Force, it would have been more authentic to depict him and his wife as being of Coorgi descent, rather than as Tamil Brahmins. This detail would have stayed true to the real-life heritage of the individuals involved.The film serves as a tribute to the often overlooked war heroes, particularly those missing in action, and sheds light on stories that many Indians, especially younger generations, may not be familiar with. It honors the daring IAF attack on Pakistan's Sargodha Airfield, an operation that parallels the scale and significance of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor during WWII. The movie also highlights the bureaucratic challenges faced by Squadron Commander Group Captain OP Taneja as he worked tirelessly to locate the missing hero, as well as the emotional turmoil experienced by the hero's wife, waiting for news of her husband.One aspect of the film that could have been improved was the way the past and present were intertwined toward the end. The montage felt a bit rushed, and a more deliberate approach could have allowed for a stronger emotional payoff, possibly eliciting a standing ovation from the audience.Akshay and Veer Paharia deliver stellar performances, capturing the emotional depth of their roles and bringing the story to life.A must watch movie for all.",

Sorry, the Area 31 crack team overact as Michelle Yeoh does everything she can to save any potential in this appalling scenario. Even she can't save this mess.If you have fond memories of high quality scripts, acting and plot, do not forget the love of tribbles waste your precious time with this abomination.

The way too long exposition dump in the form of a transmission at the beginning is unprofessional, cheap, and it tries to explain Discovery season 1 basically. New viewers won't even know what is what, and fans probably know about STD.I've seen better fan productions. It's too dark, it has bad timing, thin plot, amateurish jump cuts, the music trying to be so dramatic, it's actually comical. The camera work has random cheesy zooms. You can tell this was probably made to be a tv show. In the scene when the bad guy tries to push the blade of the sword into Michelle Yeoh's face it sounds like it was ADR-ed, but done very poorly.Star Trek is always trying to raise the stakes recently, every season of every show is trying to save the world/universe/entire galaxy, and this movie is no exception. It has no good character moments that would drive the show other than the other thing ST does these days: revenge as motivation for the enemy.Because it's a prequel we all know the world will be saved, but at least they could have killed Georgiou in a way that she could redeem herself. Also this would ensure no more of this horrible storyline.Roddenberry is rolling in his grave. I'm done with this JJ - Kurtzman era if this is a sign of what the Academy show is going to be like. I am a life long Star Trek fan, but I think this would be something I wouldn't like even if I wasn't.UPDATE\nOh, also this movie is so full of plot holes. Section 31 is supposed to be a covert operation and they just meet in bars, and even the wife of the impostor knows who they are at the end of the movie.The Discount Mr T. Character who is an augment, how did he get there? Was he with Khan in the Botany Bay? The timeline doesnt make much sense to me.Why is part of the movie about how they originally wanted to capture the Yeoh? How does that move the story forward?They have been trying to strip away everything that makes Star Trek... Star Trek, and I think they maxed this out with this movie.

        "content": "Similar in pace and feel as the Aliens movie, this is in my opinion, second only to Wrath Of Khan in the entire Star Trek canon in terms of quality. Ah, but there's that troublesome word, \"canon\". This movie is very definitely NOT in any way representative of all the Star Trek movies and series. With the possible exception of the two part In A Mirror Darkly episode Of Star Trek Enterprise, that is. Or the first Star Trek Kelvin timeline movie. This is not a bad thing, actually. I am one of those who did not much care for the Star Trek The Next Generation series because they were always so very obsessed with the Prime Directive that most of the time I wanted to just slap Jean Luc Picard senseless until he decided to grow a pair. It would have been impossible for the crew to accomplish much of anything because they were always being so caring, considerate and full of empathy. So when they invariably finally came up with a solution for the 52 minute problem at hand, it usually came off as pat, contrived and forced.Section 31 does not have that problem. It is an action adventure sci-fi roller coaster ride, pure and simple. The characters are not particularly likeable. They're not supposed to be. They are a group of spies and assassins. In fact the only reason I did not give it 10 out of 10 was that they tried to redeem Phillippa Georgiou's story arc towards the end. Somewhat. Kinda like pulling a punch. You're still hitting them in the face, but you're not deliberately trying to kill them. Like that. It lessened the character's impact and threw into question decisions she'd made before and would later make. The opening scene of Section 31 had pretty much trodden that ground already. But this is a very small complaint in what I thought was an excellent movie overall.This got a LOT of unwarranted poor reviews right out of the box. Don't believe them. Most of the reviews led me to two conclusions. 1) They based their review off the trailer or a synopsis of the film or just watched ten minutes and then left the screening room. Or, 2) The film did not affirm their love everyone and tolerate everything else ethos that Star Trek has been making out with for decades now. All hail the Prime Directive. Or not. Hey. Let's try that, instead.As the Empress of The Terran Empire Philippa Georgious would say, let's get messy. Draw your own conclusions.",

Without her, this would barely be any better than some of the Fan Films. There is no other \"star\" power to help pull this movie along or even the odd appearance of the occasional recognisable Trek star. As such, the vibe was more of a Star Wars one than a Trek one with considerably worse CGI that felt like a throwback to the 80s. The story was weak and predictable and not even up to the standard of \"Discovery\" (not one of favourite series anyway) despite being penned by three of the writers from the first series of that show. Overall, it felt low budget. I have reluctantly scored this as a \"6\" but would have given it \"5.5\" if I could. It is better than a \"5\" purely based on Michelle Yeoh's performance (nobody else had an ounce of her acting chops). This is from someone who gave TNG \"9\" to give you an idea of the scale of my disillusionment. I sincerely hope this is not an indication of the direction the franchise is going to take.

Newsflash: they're just opinions! I thought Star Trek: Section 31 had a genuinely original plot.Maybe these die-hard fans just crave the same old, same old. If you're a true Star Trek fan, you'll appreciate its fresh take. But if you're stuck in the past, still clinging to the glory days of the original series (no offense to the elderly), you might want to steer clear.Firstly, the movie masterfully delves into the gray areas of morality. Section 31, with its morally ambiguous methods, forces viewers to question the very nature of duty and sacrifice. It challenges the classic Star Trek ideals of unwavering optimism and peaceful exploration, presenting a more nuanced and realistic view of the universe. This exploration of ethical dilemmas is a hallmark of great Star Trek storytelling, and the movie delivers on that front with thought-provoking scenarios that will stay with you long after the credits roll.Secondly, the production values are top-notch. From the stunning visuals and intricate set designs to the thrilling action sequences and captivating score, the movie is a feast for the senses. The special effects are seamlessly integrated into the narrative, enhancing the immersive experience and transporting you to the depths of space. It's clear that a tremendous amount of care and attention to detail went into crafting this cinematic masterpiece, and it shows in every frame.",

The first 5 minutes were true Trek, showing the harsh landscape of the Terran Empire. But then you've got a Mission Impossible style beginning. Then, too much character exposition and dialogue from the 31 team. And can someone please sue the non-irish dialogue coach!! All that was missing was a shillelagh and a 'begorah'.Action doesn't equal Trek. The ideal of betterment and the human condition and experience seen through different lenses is Trek. Just look at the Pike speech from season 2 episode 1. You can still have a rip-roaring time and action sequences. Michelle Yeoh, still brilliant. But what they gave her.....damn! Please do better people, or you may well doom the franchise. The only saving grace is that it's on streaming and not on cinema wide release. If it was it would've tanked!",

The real issue for me is the Section 31 team, they feel more like a bunch of misfits than a group of badass spies. The biggest issue for me is that, while the idea of underdogs in Section 31 is interesting, the characters didn't quite live up to the potential. Could this be a TV series? Absolutely, but they need to flesh out the characters.Overall, it's a departure from the classic Star Trek formula, and while it could have been better, it's still worth a watch.\"",

The score was superb.The Acolyte used so many flashbacks it felt as if the DIsney production crew were pressed to reduce costs by re-using footage.

I could not tell what parts were serious drama or from the parts that were supposed to be humorous.The difficult thing here is comparing it to other Star Treks when the only direct comparison I can think of, is to \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\". How so? To start with when adjusted for inflation (or maybe not) the production budget must be the same.

        "content": "In this review I want to tell you, why I did not like it.First of all, the production design. Most sets look rediclious and somehow revamped sets from other shows. Then they ripped out the flame throwers of Discovery's bridge and planted them across the on location planet set. Did I like some of it? Yes, the interior and exterior design of the bad guy ship. Although the spinning thing in the background of the bridge looked like a disco ball.The costumes are over the top.The plot is over the top, another doomdays device, this time a quadrant, a quarter of the galaxy. That is a new scale.The writing is bad, the dialogue stupid and it has a lot of curse words. Here is an example of why the writing is bad: Georgiou wants to steal something, so she has a device with which she puts herself and the thing she wants to steal out of phase. So the owner of the thing/Mcguffin cannot touch the thing anymore and he cannot shoot Georgiou, since both are out of phase. So Georgiou can take the thing she wants and leave savely. Good plan, right? So far, so good. But, the moment she leaves, there are her friends and knock the owner out anyway. So why phase out in the first place? Suddenly someone new appears and wants to steal the thing. And surprise. He is out of phase too. What a coincidence. Now Georgiou and new guy fight and nobody can help her, because both are out of phase. Question, why not turn of the phasing device? To quote the Drinker: \"Don't know.\" So they fight on, chase each other through walls until a foot of Georgiou is stuck in a wall, because...? Now new guy can take the device and escape. Now the foot is free. Wow, did anybody read this before shooting, did nobody raise a hand and say: What does God need with a starship?The acting is also bad, and I do not know why everybody always praises Michelle Yeoh, she has always been so bad in the role of mirror Georgiou. The rest is not much better. A not-Vulcan who speaks with an Irish or Scottish accent, cannot tell the difference, but it is stupid. Then we have a Cameltoeid, a Deltan, an Augment, and Rachel Gareth. The only one I liked, actingwise and characterwise was the bad guy.All in all, that was really bad and not worth anybody's time.",

        "content": "It did not feel like a movie. It felt like a particularly violent two parter episode of Discovery, with incredibly shaky camera work.Immediately didn't feel like Star Trek when it began with her murdering her family, but I suppose that's on brand for Georgiou. The intro with the Section 31 computer voice that sounded like a Majel Barrett impersonator was pretty bad. I don't like how they just introduced the whole supporting cast in Georgiou's big expositional conversation with the Section 31 guy. The scene that followed was even more contrived as it introduced all the characters' unique quirks.Now about all those characters...Michelle Yeoh gave a great performance as Georgiou, but I think most of us can agree this character has been taken as far as she should go. It's time to move past all the death and torture.The Section 31 leader actually really nailed the moral ambiguity of the organization. He was a little one note but ultimately a decent character.The shapeshifter was actually pretty cool. I like Sam Richardson, so I'm glad they gave him a good character. He was relatable to what I might be like in those situations.The Deltan died pretty quickly, so I don't have much of an opinion. Probably for the best, since Deltans are kind of a problematic species.Space Daria (Rachel Garrett) was alright despite not being written with much of a personality. I like that actress, and she nailed the part written for her.The guy in the Vulcan suit was just a wonky alien of the week, and his whole gimmick was that he was the opposite of a Vulcan. I'll admit the betrayal took me by surprise.The guy in the other mech suit was actually annoying in a funny way, so I kind of have mixed feelings on him.San was a pretty cringey villain, who just never got over a broken heart and became delusional with his idea of \"righteous mercy\". Also the gimp suit was kind of weird, but that's not as important.So him being the villain raises some more questions about time travel. How exactly was he in the Lost Era when that's not when he and Georgiou are from? How did he know exactly what time to travel to in order to find her?I liked a few scenes, but not many...I liked the scene where they were solving the mech guy's murder. I definitely didn't see it coming when his suit was hacked to kill him. And the tiny weirdo being the traitor took me by surprise as well.The sets are pretty cool, although as usual they were too dark. I dug the space station with the wildly impractical design. The bar was pretty cool too, although it felt kind of like it was from Farscape. The ships at least felt very Star Trek. The costumes were 50/50.There are way too many fight scenes. Also a lot of torture. And as with everything about Section 31, there's a lot of overpowered technology mysteriously never makes its way into anyone else's hands in the future.Admittedly it was cool learning more about Terran politics, and Georgiou's backstory. Kind of weird they seemed to imply the Terran empire wasn't as messed up before Georgiou, when we've clearly seen that it was already just as bad in Enterprise.It makes me nervous that the end felt like it was setting up a sequel. I want to see the franchise go in another direction.",

Michelle Yo was amazing then and is amazing now. The story is good it builds and builds has plenty of action and action it even has a lovely story intertwined. There where unexpected twists at various times the characters a few where quirky a little humor at times. It never got dull or boring\nSo watch and enjoy . I'd love to see Worf be involved as he was in Picard's series as section 31 .If you like Michelle and love modern edgy Trek this is what section 1 Is about\nEnjoy.",

        "content": "To be honest, I was really quite disappointed with this. It all centres around the search for some stolen gold that has been re-stolen and hidden by \"Tornado\", the partner in a father/daughter Japanese puppetry show that is touring the shires of late 18th century Britain. The gold was originally acquired by \"Sugar\" (Tim Roth) and his gang but as they stopped to watch the show, it was re-acquired by an opportunist urchin (Nathan Malone) whilst he was being watched by \"Tornado\" (K√¥ki). When the gang discover it's missing, all hell breaks loose and so she hides the loot and the boy in their wagon and off they go. It doesn't take long for the men to put two and two together and they set after the slow-moving visitors and a rather dishonourable encounter ensues. Meantime, \"Little Sugar\" (Jack Lowden) is tired of taking orders from his old man and has plans of his own to secure the cash - and that's bound to lead to a conflict with his no-nonsense father. So now we have a brute chasing his money, a son looking for change and a samurai-trained woman out for revenge. It has the ingredients of a good adventure. Sadly, though, she is just not a very convincing actor, there is far too much meandering around the countryside setting and re-setting the scenario and there is a real paucity of pace here. It can't have had an huge budget, but that needn't have mattered if the the story had taken a little longer to develop a little more depth to the characters. It's all too episodic and though it does mix the timelines a little to break up the narrative, there are too many characters who appear then add little before we move on. It does create an overall sense of a fairly poverty-stricken and lawless rural life, but once we hit the home straight it all just takes a predictable path to it's conclusion. Nobody is really used to full effect here and though the bleakness is conveyed well enough, the story doesn't really deliver.",

After 90 grueling minutes I came to the conclusion that this movie was written and directed by people who had never actually met other human beings. Not a single line of dialog, interaction, decision or behavior seemed like anything normal people do. Every moment of character interaction felt so fake and lacked any connection to reality making the viewer's experience more like extended torture. There was not 1 likeable character and even the child was nerve gratingly annoying. There was no real plot and most staged scenes felt like they were done on no budget and used CGI to augment the missing elements but failed at every attempt. The fight/combat scenes were laughable jokes with nobody apparently able to fake actual impact. But I did get a big laugh at how the main \"hero\" (reminding me of Hudson of Hudson & Rex) completely abandons his family and doesn't even seem to care to think of them while the world is supposedly falling apart and he's doing his action hero schtick... badly. This movie feels like it was an overreach by everyone involved and they tried to fill in all the gaps in post with really bad fx work. But for me it didn't work in any way and was more anger inducing than entertaining.",

The first showdown between the cop and a shooter in a mall told me all I needed to know about where this movie was headed with its intentions. That was confirmed by the cop's numerous run-ins with a woman/demon who constantly stalks him, trying to kill him, and yet every time he has her at his mercy, he runs away from her without finishing her off...

The sound and special effects are decent, and I hope the crew got paid fairly for their work. Unfortunately, many shots felt like filler-scenes that served no purpose except to pad out the runtime.One example: a character chooses to climb over a car instead of just walking around it, even though the road is wide open. It feels forced and unrealistic. The director could definitely use a few more lessons on how to guide actors into more natural performance.",

And not knowing anything about the movie, I harbored zero expectations. But I will say that I found the movie's cover/poster interesting enough to actually draw my attention.Initially I had thought that this movie was a sequel or something, given the 'rebirth' part of the title, but that was apparently not the case. Turns out that it was apparently based on a game.The storyline in the movie was simplistic, almost to the point of being non-existing. Sure, it made for a fair enough viewing experience, but just don't expect to be using your brain during the 93 minutes that the movie ran for.I was not familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, a thing that I actually enjoy whenever I sit down to watch a movie. And the acting performances in the movie were fair, despite the fact that the actors and actresses had surprisingly little material to work with.Visually then the movie was good. I definitely liked the special effects in the movie, though while looking good they hardly did much of anything to add to the lacking storyline.\"Home Sweet Home: Rebirth\" is the type of movie that you watch once, and forget about within the coming 24 hours. Yeah, there just wasn't sufficient contents to the script or storyline to make this a memorable movie. And it most definitely is not a movie that you will sit down and watch a second time.Watchable, sure, but a very forgettable movie at best.My rating of directors Steffen Hacker and Alexander Kiesl's 2025 movie lands on a generous five out of ten stars.",

        "title": "A Solid Survival Thriller That Keeps You Watching",
        "content": "I finally caught Silent Zone, and while it's not the kind of film that's going to redefine the post-apocalyptic horror genre, it does enough right to keep you watching. It's one of those movies that doesn't try to be flashy or groundbreaking but instead leans into the tension and grit of survival-and for the most part, it works.The setup is pretty straightforward. Years after a brutal outbreak has wiped out most of civilization, survivors Cassius and Abigail have learned how to stay alive by keeping their heads down and trusting no one. Their fragile routine gets thrown off when they encounter a pregnant woman. It's a moral dilemma that forces them to risk their own safety to find her a place of refuge. From that point, it becomes a tense road movie, where the threats come not just from the infected but from other desperate survivors.What the film does well is build tension. You're never quite sure when something terrible is going to happen, and it creates this constant sense of unease. The infected are genuinely creepy, and the encounters with other survivors-who are often just as dangerous-add a layer of unpredictability. There's always this looming sense that things could go bad at any second, and that definitely kept me invested.The performances also deserve some credit. The actors bring enough emotional depth to make you care about their struggle. You can feel the fear and the weariness in them, especially during the tougher moral moments when they're deciding whether to trust strangers or keep moving. That said, while the cast is solid, the characters themselves feel a little thin at times. There are moments when I wanted to know more about their pasts or what drives them beyond just survival. The film hints at deeper emotions but doesn't quite dig deep enough to make the characters feel fully fleshed out.Visually, the movie is decent but nothing to write home about. The wasteland setting is bleak and unforgiving, which suits the story, but there's a kind of generic feel to it. It's the kind of landscape you've seen in plenty of other post-apocalyptic films, and I found myself wishing for just a bit more visual personality. The action sequences are engaging and well-paced, but there were moments when I felt like they leaned too much on standard tropes-running, hiding, close calls. It's effective but also a little predictable.That kind of sums up the whole film. Silent Zone doesn't do much wrong, but it doesn't really stand out either. It plays it safe, which isn't necessarily bad, but it means the movie is more of a solid watch than an unforgettable experience. I never felt bored, but I also never felt blown away. It's competent, tense, and has some emotional beats that land well, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it could have pushed a little harder, dug a little deeper.Still, if you're in the mood for a straightforward survival thriller with enough tension to keep you on edge, it's worth a watch. It doesn't try to be more than what it is, and in a way, I respect that. Just go in with tempered expectations, and you'll probably come away satisfied, if not overly impressed.",

        "content": "'Silent Zone' (2025) is an intense and gripping film that delivers a thrilling mix of horror and action. From the very first scene, it grabs your attention with its striking visuals and atmospheric world-building. The cinematography is excellent, capturing both the eerie stillness of the apocalyptic setting and the chaotic bursts of action. Unlike many horror films that rely solely on suspense, 'Silent Zone' packs in a surprising amount of high-energy sequences, making it feel dynamic and fast-paced.One of the film's biggest strengths is how it keeps the audience engaged with unexpected twists. Just when you think you have it figured out, the story takes a turn, keeping you on edge. The tension builds effectively, and the characters feel grounded enough to make you care about their survival. The mix of horror and adrenaline-fueled action sets this film apart, making it a refreshing entry in the genre.However, there are a couple of drawbacks. The soundtrack, while effective in heightening the tension, can feel overwhelming at times-some scenes are so loud that they almost take away from the immersion. Additionally, the runtime could have been trimmed down a bit; a slightly tighter edit would have made the film even stronger.Overall, 'Silent Zone' is a solid horror-action hybrid that fans of the genre will likely enjoy. It's tense, visually engaging, and offers enough twists to keep you invested. If you're looking for a horror film with a bit more excitement than usual, this one is definitely worth watching.",

        "title": "When Low Expectations Lead to a Great Surprise",
        "content": "Okay, I have to be honest-when my friends and I sat down to watch Silent Zone, we fully expected a disaster. We're big fans of watching B-movies together, the kind where the plot's a mess, the acting's rough, and the fun comes from laughing at how bad it is. We grabbed snacks, got comfortable, and were ready for some low-budget, post-apocalyptic nonsense. But here's the thing... Silent Zone actually surprised us. And not in a \"so bad it's good\" way, but in a \"wait, this is actually kind of decent?\" way.Sure, the setup is classic B-movie fare. It's the usual post-apocalyptic world, a deadly outbreak, desperate survivors, and the struggle to find safety. Nothing new there. But somewhere along the way, the film actually hooked us. The tension was solid, and there were at least three twists that none of us saw coming. Not groundbreaking stuff, but just clever enough to keep us invested. The story might be familiar, but it never felt lazy. In fact, it felt like the filmmakers were actually trying, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies in this genre.The characters? Surprisingly good. We went in expecting cardboard cutouts, but they had depth. By the end, we actually cared about what happened to them. And yeah, I'll admit it-I got a little emotional in the final act, which is not what I thought would happen when I hit play.And Matt Devere? Never heard of him before this, but wow. That guy has a seriously cool voice. The kind of voice that makes you pay attention. He brought this calm, tough energy to his role, and honestly, it really worked. No idea why I haven't seen him in more stuff, but he definitely stood out here.By the end, we all looked at each other like, \"That was actually good, right?\" Maybe it's because we went in with zero expectations, but Silent Zone turned out to be a solid, enjoyable movie. It's not just a film to make fun of-it's one that's actually worth watching.",

Sure, for a zombie movie, then it was somewhat generic. But it still proved entertaining nonetheless, so the movie did what it was supposed to do.There wasn't a single familiar actor or actress on the cast list, which is actually something I do enjoy whenever I watch a movie. The acting performances in the movie were fair.The snarling sounds that the infected, or zombies, made was just downright stupid. It just added a very unnecessary comedy element to the infected, and thus taking away from what was supposed to be scary.Something that definitely was interesting in \"Silent Zone\" was that writers Viktor Cs√°k and Kriszti√°n Ill√©s actually put in a small boy turning into an infected. That is usually something zombie movies tend to stay well clear of, so that was a nice touch.However, the zombie make-up and effects left much to be desired. This was ultimately a low budget zombie movie and it showed. I wasn't particularly impressed with the effects in the movie. I've seen worse low budget zombie effects, of course, but the effects in \"Silent Zone\" were nothing to write home about.Some of the music in the movie borrowed a bit too heavily from the iconic \"28 Days Later\" theme.\"Silent Zone\", despite of having a title that made zero sense to the contents of the movie, was a watchable zombie movie, but nothing out of the ordinary. There are far better zombie movies out there.My rating of director Peter Deak's 2025 zombie movie \"Silent Zone\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

It's not trying to reinvent the genre, but it does a good job with what it sets out to do.The setting pulled me in right away. That feeling of isolation, the constant threat hanging in the air - it's exactly what I look for in a post-apocalyptic story. The main characters, especially the teenage girl and the guy protecting her, had real chemistry. Their dynamic felt believable, which gave the story more emotional weight than I expected.There's not a ton of non-stop action, but when things do go down, it's tense and well-executed. You can tell the filmmakers cared about atmosphere - the silence, the pacing, the little details - it all adds up.If you're into zombie stuff like I am, Silent Zone is definitely worth checking out. It's not a game-changer, but it delivers where it counts.",

        "title": "A Familiar Survival Horror That Still Manages to Hold Your Attention",
        "content": "Going into Silent Zone, I wasn't expecting much. Let's be real-post-apocalyptic horror films are everywhere, and most of them tend to blend together. The usual tropes are all here: a world ravaged by a deadly outbreak, desperate survivors trying to stay alive, and danger lurking around every corner. But despite its familiar setup, Silent Zone manages to be an engaging, albeit flawed, survival thriller that had a few genuine surprises along the way.The film follows two main characters, Cassius and Abigail, who have survived in a world where a mysterious outbreak has turned most of humanity into something... less than human. They've made it this far by keeping their heads down and trusting no one, but their fragile existence is thrown into chaos when they encounter a pregnant woman in desperate need of help. This decision to aid her forces them into a deadly journey where they must navigate not only the infected but also other survivors who may be just as dangerous.Now, let's talk about what works. First off, the tension is solid. The movie doesn't waste time with unnecessary exposition and throws us into the bleakness of this world almost immediately. There are some genuinely intense scenes where you feel the weight of every decision the characters make, and that kept me engaged. Even though I've seen this type of setup before, the film still managed to keep me on edge in a few key moments.Another pleasant surprise was the character work. I expected the usual survival horror stereotypes-one-dimensional, tough-guy leads who make dumb decisions just to push the plot forward. But Silent Zone actually gives its characters a little more depth. Cassius and Abigail have a believable dynamic, and the film takes the time to establish their bond without overexplaining their backstories. They feel like real people who have been through hell and are just trying to make it another day. And then there's Matt Devere, who plays Cassius-I had never heard of him before, but man, that voice. His presence adds a much-needed weight to the role, and he manages to bring a lot of subtle emotion to his performance.The movie also throws in a few unexpected twists. I won't spoil them here, but let's just say that there were at least three moments where I thought I knew exactly where things were going, and then Silent Zone proved me wrong. That's rare for a movie like this, and I appreciated that it wasn't completely predictable.Now for the not-so-great parts. While the film has its strengths, it's far from perfect. The biggest issue for me was how generic the overall story feels. Yes, there are a few twists, and the characters are better than expected, but at its core, Silent Zone still follows a very well-worn formula. The world-building is fine but nothing groundbreaking. The infected, while creepy at times, don't bring anything new to the table. The danger from other survivors feels like something we've seen before in every Walking Dead season. It's all functional, but there's not a whole lot that truly stands out.Another weak spot is the action. While the tense moments work, some of the actual fight and chase scenes feel clunky. There are a few times when the editing feels a little choppy, making it hard to fully get immersed in the action. And while the film does a good job of maintaining a sense of danger, there are also stretches where it drags a little, particularly in the middle section.By the time the credits rolled, I found myself thinking, That was better than I expected... but not great. It's a solid survival horror film with some good performances and a few genuinely tense sequences, but it never quite escapes the shadow of the many, many other films that have come before it. It doesn't do enough wrong to be bad, but it doesn't do enough right to be memorable, either.So, is Silent Zone worth watching? If you're a fan of survival horror and just want a decent, well-acted thriller with some nice tension, then sure, give it a shot. Just don't go in expecting anything revolutionary.",

        "content": "\"Silent Zone\" plunges viewers into a world devastated by a sudden outbreak, following Abigail and her guardian Cassius as they navigate the perils of a feral-infested landscape in search of sanctuary. The film's Hungarian backdrop lends an unsettling authenticity to its post-apocalyptic setting, with rugged terrains and desolate vistas enhancing the narrative's bleakness.Director Peter Deak orchestrates action sequences with gritty realism, from visceral hand-to-hand combat to a tense scramble to launch an aircraft before it's overtaken by ferals. However, these intense moments are sporadic, and the film's two-hour duration occasionally feels sluggish.Adapted from Viktor Cs√°k's novel \"Welcome to the Silent Zone,\" the screenplay strives for emotional depth but often falls into familiar post-apocalyptic tropes, such as the secretly infected survivor and the deranged scientist aiming to control the undead. These clich√©s sometimes make the plot feel predictable.Nevertheless, the film benefits from its authentic locations and committed performances. The cast delivers grounded portrayals that add weight to the story, especially during its more emotionally charged scenes.Regrettably, the film's pacing and some underdeveloped characters detract from its overall impact. It's only in the climactic final act, featuring a feral assault on The Colony, that the movie fully realizes its potential, delivering the horror and intensity anticipated from the outset.Had the earlier parts maintained this level of urgency, \"Silent Zone\" might have distinguished itself more within the crowded zombie genre. As it stands, it's an ambitious yet uneven film that will likely resonate most with fans of \"The Walking Dead\" or those who appreciate a grittier take on the undead apocalypse.",

It takes the post-apocalyptic genre and adds real heart, stunning visuals, and plenty of tension to make for an unforgettable experience.The story follows Abigail, who loses her family in a brutal outbreak that turns people into savage \"ferals.\" She's taken in by Cassius, a tough but caring cop, and together they survive in this harsh new world for over a decade. When they cross paths with a desperate couple, Megan and David, their fragile existence is thrown into chaos, forcing them to confront tough choices about trust, survival, and morality.Visually, the movie is stunning-the abandoned cities and overgrown landscapes really sell the eerie, post-pandemic world. The soundtrack is subtle but adds to the tension in all the right moments.The performances are fantastic, especially Abigail, who perfectly balances strength and vulnerability. Cassius is the classic hardened survivor with a softer side, and the supporting cast adds extra depth to the story. Everyone feels real, making it easy to connect with their struggles.Beyond the action and suspense, Silent Zone also makes you think-about survival, human nature, and what it really means to stay human when everything falls apart. While there are a few slower moments, the film is gripping from start to finish.If you're a fan of The Road or 28 Days Later, you'll love Silent Zone. It's intense, emotional, and beautifully made-definitely one of the best survival horror films of the year. Don't miss it!",

        "content": "Let me start by saying-I don't compare indie films to big-budget Hollywood productions, and I'm not expecting the kind of visual effects or scale that come with tens of millions of dollars. I also don't hold a film accountable for the resources it didn't have. But what I do expect-no matter the budget-is for the film to be good on its own terms. And Silent Zone mostly delivers on that.This was better than I expected for an indie zombie movie. Silent Zone has some really strong moments, especially when it focuses on the relationship between Cassius and Abigail. Matt Devere is great as the lead-tough but grounded-and Luca Papp holds her own too. Their scenes together give the film a surprising amount of heart.The atmosphere is solid all around. The wilderness setting and bleak tone work well, and the infected are creepy without being over-the-top. It's more of a slow-burn survival story than a non-stop action movie, but there are a few intense scenes that stood out. Also appreciated the twist that the ferals aren't totally brain-dead-it added a bit of tension.That said, the story hits a lot of familiar notes. If you've seen your fair share of apocalyptic survival films, you'll probably guess where things are going. There are also a couple of abrupt cuts that took me out of the moment, and the pacing dips a little in the middle.Still, you can tell this was made with care. It doesn't reinvent the genre, but it's gritty, well-acted, and emotionally grounded. For a low-budget horror film, it punches above its weight. Worth checking out if you're into survival horror with some heart.Special mention to Matt Devere-he brings real weight to the lead role and I'd honestly love to see him in more films. Also, director Peter Deak shows a lot of promise here.",

I'm not familiar with French cinema but the main actor Guillaume Canet was great and really sold me on his tough guy persona. He really was the emotional core of the story, aside from just being an outright badass. The dude does everything : parkour, driving, martial arts....you name it!However, \"Ad Vitam\" really struggled to hold my attention throughout its short run time, and just comes across as a cheaper and inferior version of the \"Mission Impossible\" series. The story didn't grip me at all. The majority of the film is one big flashback that doesn't even get to the main plot introduced at the start of the film until just over an hour in. For an action film, it's incredibly slow and plodding, and doesn't seem to have any momentum or pace until it suddenly ramps up in the last 30 minutes. It feels like a solid 40 minute pilot episode of a TV series stretched out to 95 minutes to be considered feature length.Overall, it's not a film I'd recommend.

        "content": "Ad Vitam (2025), directed by Rodolphe Lauga, is a thriller that follows Franck Lazareff (Guillaume Canet), who survives an attempted murder and embarks on a quest to find his kidnapped wife, Leo. As Franck delves deeper into a world of mystery, he is confronted by his past and swept into a state conspiracy that proves more than he bargained for. While the premise offers potential for a gripping and emotional story, the film fails to rise above the clich√©s of the genre.Guillaume Canet, despite being a talented actor, feels miscast in this film. His performance, while competent, lacks the depth and complexity that might have made his character truly compelling. It's surprising that an actor of his caliber chose to take on a role in such a formulaic and uninspired narrative. The supporting cast, including Jamel Blissat and Rayan Bouazza, doesn't bring anything particularly noteworthy to their roles, with their performances often feeling wooden and lacking emotional engagement.The film's biggest weakness lies in its screenplay. The story follows a predictable path, offering few surprises or twists. While it tries to combine elements of action, mystery, and conspiracy, it never fully commits to any one genre, leaving the narrative feeling disjointed. The pacing also suffers, with certain plot points dragging on too long, and the dialogue feels repetitive and uninspired, leaving little for the viewer to truly connect with.Visually, the film offers some decent action sequences, but the cinematography doesn't bring anything fresh or innovative to the genre. The direction is competent but lacks the flair needed to elevate the film beyond its generic premise. Ultimately, Ad Vitam feels like a classic example of a film that is forgettable, offering only brief moments of intrigue before fading into obscurity.Rating: 5/10. A passable thriller with little to distinguish it from others in the genre, despite a talented cast and a promising premise.",

The acting is decent, although I watched the Dubbed into English version so it is a little harder to tell how decent.",

In fact, the movie wants to stuff in too many genres and it's detrimental to its efficiency to keep the viewer interested. If you want to make an action movie you must mostly focus on that. The rest, thriller, romance, mystery can be present but as back up the main theme/genre of the movie. The major flaw of the movie is the flashback which is way too long, gives an off topic feeling, you lose interest in the plot.The movie industry in France has only like 400-800 working professionals. And its hard for new comers to enter the club with new, fresh ideas. These guys seems to always want to play it safe so they rely and the same story telling style that I have seen for so many years in France. There is no real innovation in the editing, the acting and the plot. The acting/casting here is a total mess. There are absolutely brilliant actors in France but unless you have the connections/recommendations (piston in French) you have, most of the time, chance to get hired. The acting is atrocious not believable at all, the dialogues are parroted. Don't lose your time.",

The film follows Franck, played by Canet, a former member of the elite French police unit GIGN, who must save his pregnant wife L√©o (St√©phane Caillard) from kidnappers while evading the police.The movie delivers some impressive action sequences, particularly the stunts filmed in Paris and Versailles. Canet's performance is solid, though some may find it lacking the intensity of other action stars like Liam Neeson or Jason Statham. The plot, however, feels somewhat underdeveloped, with the action scenes taking precedence over character development and narrative depth.Overall, Ad Vitam offers a mix of thrilling action and a somewhat thin storyline, making it an entertaining watch for fans of the genre, but perhaps not a standout in terms of plot complexity.Netflix, like other streaming platforms, has to meet certain content quotas in various regions, including Europe. These quotas often require a certain percentage of content to be locally produced . While it's possible that Ad Vitam was produced to meet such requirements, it's also common for streaming services to invest in a wide range of content to appeal to diverse audiences.",

In 2011, you had L'ASSAUT and in 2007, you also had L'ORDRE ET LA MORALE. Both films inspired from actual events where the Gendarmerie elite Force was involved. This movie is a fiction, but the first part looks like a semi documentary about the daily life of the GIGN members; as if director Claude Sautet had made a film about the GIGN, members shown among themselves in trianing, family reunions with kids and so on.... The second part, as many other action French thrillers, involves Intelligence obscure Forces - DGSI and - or - DGSE. Intelligence untold Government elite forces in charge of protecting \"sensitive\" matters and this at all costs, including the most \"extreme prejudice\" criminal actions.... A scheme seen in many movies and series, for instance BRAQUO and much other stuff.... Not a bad film but, I repeat, why such a lousy ending? WHY? Actually the last fifteen minutes are so lousy, the Hollywood way, instead of remaining French. But that's the first time I see a pregnant woman fist fighting with men. I guess KILL BILL inspired such a sequence. And also the Guillaume Canet's sidekick, whose knee is supposed to be wounded, smashed, this guy runs, jumps like a rabbit.... Not AD VITAM eternam. No.",

Of course it's not necessarily a sure formula, but it worked in this case as well. The decidedly French locations and sights and the language improved my experience of an otherwise mid movie that managed to annoy me quite a lot about 20 minutes in, because it's exactly the formula that I hate - a man cornered and brutalized with no way out. It's overdone and not exactly stimulating and I'm sick of it, because I don't care for adrenaline heavy, breakneck speed long scenes and taunting as main drivers of the plot. So after that conundrum we are plunged into a flashback from 10 years before, which was getting quite long but I came to appreciate it in the end because it was definitely an improvement on the beginning. So we are taken back to the present with less than 40 minutes to solve the whole situation, and again it's one action scene after another. It wasn't bad, in fact I'd say they did it well and surprisingly there is a happy ending after all that danger. But essentially the only surprising thing about this movie is the reveal about the reason why they're doing this to the guy and especially who is behind it. And I'm not questioning the possibility of that happening in real life, it could, but maybe with a lot more discretion than this, bodies dropping left and right. Also, no way would they let him go. It is a little far-fetched I would say, but yes, Paris, Versailles and French saved the movie. Also, Guillaume Canet has aged and I am no longer captivated. But that's a me problem.",

Well it's a movie I guess and mysterious words of wisdom too. Ad vitam, yeah it means \"for life\". Me, I'm \"for\" a plot gloss as to why an FBI agent seems to have people wanting to either kill him or arrest him. Yeesh!Anyway Ad Vitam is a slickly-made thriller, so slick in fact that it distracts you from how choppy it is from a narrative standpoint. Although directed by four-timer Rodolphe Lauga, \"Ad\" looks like something action monger Brian A. Miller would've done ten years ago, shiny and glossy and violent and hollow and well, pedestrian. Look for low budget, typewriter title cards, clear the area police action, and rather plodding shootouts. About the only things missing from Ad Vitam are Thomas Jane, Bruce Willis and some monotonous, cue card line readings.As per the last paragraph, I can't really compute the actual diegesis of Ad Vitam, I just can't. The film has no wiki page anyway and that just makes everything that much more frustrating. I mean I know \"Ad's\" lead is the sleepwalking Guillaume Canet, a cross between the poor man's Bradley Cooper and the poor man's Patrick Dempsey. I know the film is told mostly in slogged flashbacks, with training scenes for members of GIGN's tactical unit interspersed with sudden bursts of brute force. I know there's a pregnant wife character (Stephanie Caillard as Leo) who doesn't mind harming said pregnancy slinging fists of fury. Um, I know Netflix is involved (shocker). Finally, I know Ad Vitam was shot in the country of France (\"wee-ooh, wee-ooh\"). Now is that enough my beret-loving \"Frogs?\" Not for a recommendation. \"Ad out\".",

Fortunately, the elite fighter also has some good colleagues (Nassim LYES from SOUS LA SEINE and Alexis MANENTI from LES MISERABLES) who rush to help with their powerful skills.Of course, this film has some weaknesses, such as the miserably long flashbacks at the beginning of the film, but NETFLIX has provided a budget that makes such a well-illustrated action film possible in France. The fights and chases on the street and in the air are well done. Breathtaking images of Sacre-Coeur and the Versailles Palace Park included! The film also does full justice to the French PolAr tradition (film policier and Argot). It is a lot of fun to watch and has so far been quite successful on the global streaming service.In a small role, there is also a reunion with Stephane RIDEAU (in the sequence in Sacre-Coeur), who became known in 1993 with ROSEAUX SAUVAGES.",

It shows a very important side of the lives of such people: family. Sometimes, we forget that the military people not only sacrifice their lives, they also sacrifice the comforts of staying with their family. And in unfortunate circumstances, these people give up their lives, casting a permanent shadow on the psyche of their loved ones. This film accurately depicts to what extent people can go to save their loved ones.However, I feel that this movie is a slow peel, just like the peeling of an onion slowly and steadily. It gradually unfolds the lives and motivations of different characters. This is a fresh take, and I haven't seen thriller movies recently made in this style. But I am not sure if this will attract the fast-moving people of this generation who are addicted to 30-second reels on their phones.",

        "title": "Action Without Substance",
        "content": "\"Ad Vitam\" is a French action thriller directed by Rodolphe Lauga that attempts to engage the audience in a story of revenge and rescue but stumbles over its own ambitions. The film follows Franck Lazareff (Guillaume Canet), a former agent of the elite French police unit GIGN, who seeks to live a peaceful life with his pregnant wife, Leo (St√©phane Caillard). However, his past resurfaces violently when Leo is kidnapped by a mysterious group, forcing Franck into a dangerous yet predictable mission to save her.The film's narrative is one of its greatest weaknesses. The fragmented structure, alternating between the present and flashbacks, feels more like a failed attempt at depth than a well-executed storytelling device. Instead of enriching the story, this approach disrupts the flow and weakens the emotional impact, making the plot unnecessarily confusing.Despite this, Lauga's direction stands out in some technical aspects. The action sequences are well choreographed, showcasing meticulous attention to detail that, at times, holds the film together. The cinematography captures both urban and rural landscapes of France, creating visually appealing settings that, however, do not compensate for the superficiality of the script.Nevertheless, the film struggles to balance its contrasting tones. It swings between the raw realism of a French police thriller and stylized action scenes that verge on exaggeration, failing to integrate these elements organically. Additionally, the character development is shallow, with generic dialogue and a protagonist whose emotional journey lacks depth. Some scenes also seem to use tourist landmarks as mere backdrops, without solid narrative justification.Curiously, Ad Vitam reached Netflix's Top 10 in 93 countries. What could have attracted such a wide audience? There is nothing in the film that justifies this phenomenon. Its inconsistent script, uneven direction, and generic execution offer nothing innovative or memorable. This raises the question of what truly drives the success of certain productions in the streaming era: artistic merit or pure marketing influence?Ultimately, Ad Vitam is a generic thriller that, despite a few well-executed moments of tension, lacks a distinct identity. Its attempt to blend drama and action results in an inconsistent and forgettable film that is unlikely to stand out within the genre.",

I think overall it was a fun action movie and an enjoyable watch, but there's some suspension of disbelief here that's a little tough to get over.

        "content": "Ad Vitam is one of those films that might entertain casuals, appealing to their need of high-action scenes and over-the-top thrilling plot points, but critics should catch the flaws of the story upfront, and, through exposure, diminish the payoff of this film.The story starts strong: Franck is a former GIGN agent and is hiding a secret. Because of this sin, he is being chased by some high-profile hitmen searching for a particular item. This premise appeals to any action thriller fan in the world, but unfortunately, Ad Vitam just does it all wrong.First, we start in media res, which is a turn down. This means we start at the middle, then we jump back to get some backstory, then we are back to the present for the finale. This technique sometimes work, but I feel it does not for Ad Vitam. The change of pace is abrupt, and the backstory is not that thrilling altogether. It is like we start with an action thriller film, then we jump to a love story, then we jump back to what I can only call pure action.The chemistry between characters L√©o and Franck work, but only because of actress St√©phane Caillard. She gives her heart trying to make their relationship work onscreen, while Guillaume Cane is just this wood plank too traumatized by whatever his dad did - though, cudos to Canet for the emotion-packed scene when his friend Nico dies.Then there are two big problems with this film: the plot and the villain.The story is full of holes to keep what I call convenience suspense, which is when events serve the purpose of just keeping the protagonist alive, rather than playing out in a logical way. These type of events happen throughout the whole plotline of Ad Vitam, a series of unforgivable conveniences after the other. To give you an example of such events, imagine Villain has Protag overwhelmed at gunpoint, but Villain decides to let Protag live out of dumb decisions like a stupid, elaborate plan he wants to follow to the details (instead of adjusting to the situation), or out of pure pride or mockery, the old \"I will let you live because I want to make you suffer\" (rather than just winning altogether).The plot seems to reach high-profile, scaling up towards Government conspiracy levels, but then things resolve in the most uninterested and low-key way possible. I started wondering how Franck would get out of the mess he got himself into, but what should I have hoped for: of course the story just disregards all the stakes it created, later focusing only on Franck and L√©o.And the villain ended up being a shocker, in a bad sense: a full transition from someone that the story introduced as a cunning man to a buffoon. Disappointing.Director Rodolphe Lauga is a newbie on the industry, with only 4 entries into his portfolio. I think this lack of experience might have had a toll on the film performance.Ad Vitam fails in most aspects, unredeemable. It starts out nicely but then raises the stakes high without creating payoff. Plot points are a series of off-track beats after another, culminating in an anticlimactic ending that does not make justice to the stakes at play.",

However, the makers have spiced things up with a few fresh elements and a few unexpected plot twists, making it an engaging yet lengthy watch.The storytelling is slow paced but thanks to an intriguing screenplay that keeps you hooked. Unlike the usual Star studded commercial entertainers loaded with formulaic sequences and dance numbers, this film dares to be different.Now, let's talk about Ajith - the man of the hour! He appears in four distinct looks across different timelines, and except for the black-bearded one (which is debatable), he looks effortlessly stylish and dashing. His performance? One of his career-best! He nails the emotional scenes, dominates the action sequences, and is absolutely charming in the romantic portions.Trisha, on the other hand, is a vision of beauty, especially in the flashback sequences. Her acting is subtle, natural, and simply top-notch. Together, Ajith and Trisha exude an international charm, making them look like stars straight out of a Hollywood film.Antagonists Arjun and Regina deliver solid performances, adding more depth to the story. The rest of the cast does a commendable job too.Coming to the technical aspects - the cinematography is stunning, with world-class color grading that enhances the visuals. The locations are breathtaking, making every frame a treat for the eyes. Music is pleasant, complementing the film well. Sets, costumes, and makeup are meticulously done, adding to the grandeur. And let's not forget the action sequences, which are choreographed brilliantly!Magizh Thirumeni's direction is commendable.Overall, this is a stylish, well-crafted film that is definitely worth watching!",

        "content": "Ajith Kumar and Trisha Krishnan's outing, Vidaamuyarchi, is inspired by the Hollywood film Breakdown. The movie doesn't give the usual euphoria Ajith fans expect from their hero, but offers some enjoyable moments in the last one hour. Those who watch road trip thrillers on OTT, or are familiar with the genre, might find the set-up and storyline very predictable. While the first half stays true to Breakdown, the second half has been Kollywoodised to cater to fans and local audience.Arjun (Ajith Kumar) and Kayal (Trisha Krishnan), decide to get married 3 months after meeting each other. Twelve years and a miscarriage later, the couple are clearly not happy. Kayal reveals about her affair with another man, and initiates divorce, but Arjun insists that their relationship is not yet broken beyond repair. When Kayal decides to move to her parents' house in Tbilisi - a 10-hour drive from their house in Baku, Azerbaijan - till the divorce proceedings are settled, Arjun insists that he drop her. The road is long with desert on either side. Arjun loses sight of the road for a second during a serious conversation with Kayal, and almost hits a vehicle. The hooligans in the other car mildly warn Arjun. When stopped for petrol, Kayal encounters truck driver Rakshit (Arjun Sarja) and his wife Deepika (Regina Cassandra), also Tamilians. When Arjun's vehicle gives up mid-way, he sends Kayal with Rakshit and Deepika to drop her at a cafe nearby. When Arjun finally reaches the cafe, he finds out that Kayal has been kidnapped. Can he save her on time or will he lose her forever?Vidaamuyarchi starts off very slow, with Sawadeeka song - which starts as soon as the movie begins - being the only high point throughout the first half. The first half, which covers the couple's relationship drama, flashback sequences and the incidents that lead to Kayal's kidnap, is slow and dull. It reaches an interesting point at the interval, only to be bogged down by a quick revelation about Arjun Sarja and Regina's backgrounds. Had the director Magizh Thirumeni placed this part towards the climax, the film would have become an intriguing thriller. But the revelation about the couple's psychosis ends up being a spoiler for the supposedly thrilling second half, thus making it very predictable. The half-hour leading up to the interval feels repetitive. The film comes together in the last one hour, but the closure is utterly disappointing as it feels like a convenient wrap up.Vidaamuyarchi is not the usual Ajith outing and marks a departure from his typical mass masala films with an entry song and lengthy dialogues. While there are two ways to see this, the movie might be disappointing for Ajith fans expecting mass moments. Ajith wields a white flag from the beginning and stays away from putting up a fight until heavily provoked. He gets beaten up more than he can ever give back. The action sequences are ordinary and natural, and don't suit the tone of the film. Vidaamuyarchi lacks the stand-out moment fans eagerly look forward to. Ajith is stoic as a man who is caught unaware of why Kayal is divorcing him. Throughout the film, he puts up a class act as the film focuses on content over style. Trisha appears prominently in the first half, and has very little to do in the second half as she goes missing. Arjun and Regina's roles required a little more depth. While adapting from the core of Breakdown, the filmmaker fails to provide details about why Arjun and Regina are the way they are. They have performed their roles with ease.Om Prakash's cinematography offers some good frames as he captures the deserted roads of Azerbaijan in true tone. His camera work enhances the visual appeal of the film. Anirudh Ravichander is in top form, but shows off his excellence in the last few minutes. As expected, Sawadeeka stands out, and the rest of the songs are blended into the story.Vidaamuyarchi might find its space with some niche audience, but a racy screenplay, especially considering the genre, could have made the movie dearer to all.",

Magizh thirumeni proves that tamil cinema also have a knowledge of making like a hollywood movie. First half was little bit slow especially AK and Trisha were going to the trip. First of all it's not a trip. That's their last trip together. They decided to take a divorce. After Arjun and Aarav's entry the whole movie was fire. As usual rocking star Anirudh plays a vital role. Background score like a fire, especially drum beat plays and suddenly stopped then audience will shout \"Ajitheyyyyy\".Second half was unexpectable. I thought that second half also had a lag. But AK's character also change in the second half. This movie shows what happens when a common man gets angry. There is no punch dialogues and there is no commercial scenes and there is no audience favourable reference. It's just an action film to watch with your family. Overall don't expect anything, just go and watch the film. Definitely you will enjoy the film. At the end this is the real pongal by Magizh thirumeni.",

        "content": "Ajith's latest film, Vidaamuyarchi, is definitely leagues above the trash he's been in over the last few years. Good scripts seem to be this guy's kryptonite because there hasn't been a single decent Ajith movie since Yennai Arindhaal-a whole decade ago! And no, Nerkonda Paarvai was a disaster; cope harder.However, when the first trailer for Vidaamuyarchi dropped a couple of weeks ago, it felt like this movie could actually be pretty decent if executed well. Watching it in cinemas reinforced that the execution is what ultimately holds it back from being a truly good film. The plot itself wasn't terrible, but the writing surrounding it felt completely unaware of the mess it was creating. Those flashback sequences and everything in the third act? A testament to that chaos.The first half of the movie was surprisingly good, albeit a tad slow. It set up a few intriguing narratives that made us curious about where it was headed. But then, around 15 minutes into the second half, it nosedived into a predictable mess. You could practically see the rest of the movie unfolding: our hero takes down the villains, and you're just left waiting to see how quickly you can get home. Toss in a few unintentionally comedic moments, and you've got a film that squanders its potential as an action thriller.Still, it's not a movie I'd outright advise against watching. While it's not a masterpiece, it's definitely not bad. Technically, it's very sound, featuring gorgeous cinematography and serviceable action choreography that will at least keep your attention. And as far as Ajith movies go, that's a win in itself. Let's just hope the next one is even better!",

They could have easily made this movie at least half as interesting as Samar (2013) by having some decent redemption in the second half, but they did not.Also, the makers misled the audience by the teaser/trailer itself. Anirudh's hyped BGM has no sync with the actual movie. Not sure whose idea was to reveal the antagonists in the teaser/trailer itself, especially when the movie itself has a wafer-thin plot line.I can go on and on about the mishaps.Having said that, it's not completely bad like 'Kanguva' or 'Indian 2'.

Im okay with slow paced screenplay. If u loved the goat breaking bad, u wont even point the slow pace as a issue. I dunno maybe i might try new theatres, the theatre promoted it as 4k rgb, the brightness isnt upto the mark. It was gk poonga, manampathy,kancheepuram. The 2nd show actually, there wasnt any wopping crowd. Barely half filled. Whats wondering is the ticket price, 150rs.The film shows quality, a perfect example for how a fine film should be. The twists actually worked well, the writing of tight situations are worked very well. The feel of lost, actually felt by us. The divorce convincing dialogues are deep and convinced well. There were flashbacks, it was okey, but yet not much detailed. So dialogues fills the gaps. The music wasnt that much notable, but works well with the movie. The music does its part in this art form.Whats not okay is the predictable story, there will be a scene which shows regina cassandra's flashback. It actually spoiled the engagement. It might be placed at the end of the film(atleast her psychopath behaviour).In some scenes the story is stretched as per the directors idea, not convincing tbh.Whats most wierder in this film is the subtitle colour, green. Whose idea is that ?The second half has the fight sequences, which was intense. The play of two masterminds is barely rememberable in the screen play.The editing, placing might changed the film's screenplay to make it as a cult film. The bit predictable, stretched story becomes a villain for this movie.So the movie as a movie fanatic, is worth a watch as a whole package.But questionable for benchmark lvl box office hits, since it barely satisfies general audience.",

The second half of the movie is slightly action oriented and the director has brought out more of an emotional side of Thala in this movie and may not be completely satisfying for Thala fans expecting high octane action sequences,slow motion and mass dialogues.Good performance by Ajith Kumar. Character portrayal of Trisha altogether felt incomplete. Arjun Sarjaa,Regina Cassandra,Nikhil Nair & Aarav has made notable performances.Om Prakash has captured the visual beauty of the deserts and barren lands of Baku on a visually appealing note. Good action sequences especially in the car has brilliantly been choreographed by Master Supreme Sundar complemented with Anirudh's BGM's.A watchable thriller on emotional perseverance with a slow and distinctive narrative style .",

If you're a fan of cinema with substance, this one's for you! üé•‚ú®Let's get right to it:üí• Ajith Kumar as Arjun-A Bold, Realistic Performance!Ajith Kumar's portrayal of Arjun is not the usual mass hero you'd expect. There are no heavy dialogues, no forced elevation-just a solid, cinema-driven character. It's a big risk for a star like Ajith to step into this grounded, realistic role, and he nails it! üé≠üî•üò≥ The First Half - A Slow Burn, But Worth the Wait!If you're expecting an action-packed start, think again. The first half is all about building the character and setting up the story. While Arjun takes a beating from the villain, there's no grand fight sequence to hype up the audience. For fans used to instant gratification, this can feel a bit slow, but trust me, it pays off in the second half! üò±üí•üé• Cinematography - Crafting a Masterpiece!The cinematography here is absolutely stunning. The anamorphic format, the lighting, and the realistic locations bring a fresh feel to the movie. It's clear that a lot of thought went into every frame-especially in the stunt sequences. The stunt choreography, especially during the climax, is extraordinary! You won't just watch it-you'll feel every hit and every moment. The combination of stunt photography and cinematography is one of the film's strongest aspects, making the action scenes even more gripping. üîÑüî´üî•üé∂ Anirudh's BGM - A Sonic Treat!The background score, composed by Anirudh, complements the film perfectly. It adds so much to the mood of the movie-intensifying the action and the tension. Watching this on Dolby Atmos 7.1 will give you a full-on immersive experience, where every sound comes alive. üéß‚ö°üé∂üåü Direction - Sculpting a Masterpiece!Director Magil Thirumeni has truly sculpted VidaaMuyarchi like a statue, making sure every detail is perfect. The way he has crafted the movie shows that it's not just about star power-it's about telling a good, well-thought-out story. There are no flaws in his direction, and the film stands out as an example of quality filmmaking. üé¨üî•This film isn't necessarily for the typical mass movie fan. It's a movie for the true cinema lover-someone who enjoys great content and storytelling over the usual hero-driven narrative. It's not about the star; it's about the quality of the movie.üí• A Milestone in Ajith Kumar's Career!Ajith Kumar takes a big leap in his career with this one. It might not be a typical star movie, but it's a milestone in quality cinema-one that shows his versatility and commitment to the craft. üöÄüé¨üö® The One Drawback:\nThe only real downside is the slowness of the first half, but it's all worth it when the film picks up pace. Apart from that, there's really nothing to complain about.VidaaMuyarchi is a bold attempt, and it's definitely worth watching in theaters for its cinematic brilliance. Don't go in expecting a typical mass film-it's a movie for the audience who values good cinema and strong content.",

This action thriller is an electrifying journey from start to finish, keeping you on the edge of your seat with intense action, thrilling sequences, and unexpected twists. With stellar performances and a captivating plot, it's a must-watch for all!VIDAAMUYARCHI is an absolute banger! From the first scene, it's a non-stop adrenaline rush that hits HARD. And #AK as Arjun? Man with a whole vibe, silent but moves like a king, drip on 100, and power in every step. His screen presence, intensity, and swag are just next-level. 2nd half, AK doozes power and confidence.As a die-hard #Thala fan, this is EVERYTHING! That Car fight, Thala made that Hummer his fight ring - Zero stunts wasted, all impact with Straight alpha mode! #Ajith's look? Perfection! Every frame screams style, power, and mass. Mazigh's direction nails the larger than life storytelling, and Anirudh's BGM? Literal goosebumps, it had the whole theatre.",

        "content": "This movie is an official remake of the Hollywood film Breakdown, starring Ajith Kumar, Action King Arjun, Trisha, with music by Rockstar Anirudh, and directed by Magizh Thirumeni.I was really impressed by the director because he turned a big mass hero into a subtle character. There are no big action scenes or punch dialogues, but the hero looks very classy. Honestly, it's a great effort to change a mass hero into an ordinary man, and it worked well. The director took time to set up the story and slowly build it. He also made sure to introduce every important character, and it turned out great. The cinematography was a highlight of the movie; it brought the film to life. Anirudh's music took the movie to another level, especially the last 20 minutes, which were amazing.However, there are a few flaws. The first one is that after watching the movie, I couldn't remember the story. It's a good film, but the story feels a bit weak. They took an idea and just built the screenplay around it. Also, the movie isn't very fast-paced; some people might find it boring, but I didn't feel that way.Apart from that, I liked the film and think it's something you can watch with your family.",

Everyone has got a good amount of screen space. Actors Arjun and Regina Cassandra got brilliant characters and they have done a great job. All the characters have been built perfectly. Actor Arav's character has been built amazingly in the first half but in the second half his character was not upto the level. Actor Ajith's frames were awesome. A must watch movie in theatres.",

Vidaamuyarchi has neither a tight script nor catchy dialogues.Most of the scenes are disconnected and feels like somebody is holding the actors at gun point to make them act. In fact, dialogues are the worst part of the movie, especially when local language is spoken.There are unnecessary flashbacks that don't add to the movie's storyline. The paramour is never shown. The reason for Trisha to go with her lover is not explained clearly.Then, there are local actors who are either facing the camera for the first time or they don't understand the plot.Was waiting to see if there would be something good coming on subsequent scenes.

        "content": "Your original paragraph might have had special characters or symbols that some platforms do not accept. Below is a cleaned-up version of your paragraph without any invalid characters:---I am seriously not an Anil fan but a Thala veriyan. Today, I watched this movie for one and a half hours, and I never thought I would walk away in the middle of a movie, but I wanted to leave at the interval. The original Breakdown was released in 1997 with a runtime of just 1 hour and 33 minutes, yet it had a better story and screenplay for its time. The hero did a splendid job, especially in the scene where he saved his wife, and the red truck chase was thrilling. The movie ended with a satisfying conclusion.But in Vidamuyarchi, an official remake of that film, they added unnecessary characters and backstories, which was a bad choice. Regina Cassandra's character had no weight-she was just there with her navel and belly button showing. They simply said she was antisocial, but it had no impact. Arjun barely had any character depth. He was not menacing, and we didn't know much about him. If you removed Regina and Arav, the story would remain the same without any change.Breakdown didn't have much backstory for its characters, but that was fine because of its racy and fast-paced screenplay. The short runtime was a big advantage. In contrast, Vidamuyarchi was set in Azerbaijan, which looked empty and visually unappealing. The cinematographer did his best, but the location felt like a wasteland.This is a Tamil movie, and when you have Kollywood's biggest star, Ajith Kumar, as the hero, the film has to satisfy fans. Even the general audience didn't enjoy it. There were no elevation scenes, no mass dialogues, and no weight given to Ajith sir's character. He took too many punches and kicks, and then he surrendered to the police like he was scared. Magizh Thirumeni, what were you thinking? My friends said it was a great movie, cheering and whistling at some scenes, but the entire theater was silent in the second half. I was totally disappointed. The story tried to add a shock factor with Trisha's character being revealed as evil at the interval, but it didn't engage me at all.And who was Trisha's affair partner? No one talked about him. Her friend had affection for Thala, while Trisha had an affair-why should we care about them? It was disgusting. That's why the emotions felt as plain as cardboard in the ending. Regina and Arav had the worst fate, and Arjun was thrown into a shredder. In reality, Magizh Thirumeni should be thrown into that shredder so we can escape this nightmare.The ending tried to be emotional, with Trisha dying, but it felt like an art film conclusion. And despite everything that happened, the film still used cinematic liberty to keep Trisha alive. The last scene had AK saying \"I love you,\" and they hugged-what nonsense! Did they forget about the affair and all the betrayals? How can everything be fine again? Yikes.Overall, this was a dry movie with no elevation scenes or goosebumps moments for my Thala. As for Anirudh, I don't even want to talk about his music. He only used the \"Kadavuley Ajitheyyyy\" theme in every scene, thinking that was enough. Bro, what are you doing? Fire Anirudh from the music industry-he has lost his charm. The background score was average at best.The only good thing was seeing my Thala on screen after two years, even in this useless movie. Some people might call me an \"Anil\" just because I didn't like the film, but I don't care. This movie was not good. I am waiting for my Chella Kutty Adhik-I will do a full fanboy celebration for my AK. I hope it delivers. General audiences should avoid this movie-it's a total waste of time.",

Ajith's acting was incredibly realistic and natural, making his character truly captivating. Arjun delivered an outstanding performance, adding depth and intensity to the story. Anirudh's music elevated every scene, enhancing the emotions and excitement throughout the film.

He walks through streets, deserts, forests, and at one point, a shopping mall, always gripping the bag like it contains the meaning of life. The audience, however, is left wondering: what's in the bag? Why is he carrying it so far? Does he even know where he's going?For two and a half grueling hours, the film drags on with minimal dialogue. Occasionally, strangers ask him what's in the bag, to which he either ignores them or mutters something vague like, \"I have to keep going.\" There are no action sequences, no emotional breakthroughs-just a man and his stubborn determination to carry that bag. The cinematography is decent, but after the fiftieth shot of him walking, it loses its charm.",

        "content": "Vidaamuyarchi starts off very slow, with Sawadeeka song - which starts as soon as the movie begins - being the only high point in the slow and dull first half, which covers the couple's relationship drama, flashback sequences and the incidents that lead to Kayal's kidnap. It reaches an interesting point at the interval, only to be bogged down by a quick revelation about the antagonists. Had director Magizh Thirumeni placed this part towards the climax, the film would have become an intriguing thriller. The revelation ends up being a spoiler for the supposedly thrilling second half, making it very predictable. The half-hour leading up to the interval also feels repetitive. The film comes together in the last one hour, but the closure is utterly disappointing as it feels like a convenient wrap up.",

        "title": "Ajith & Trisha's Action Thriller is Lost in Romance",
        "content": "Vidaamuyarchi (2025) :\nMovie Review -Ajith and Trisha team up for Vidaamuyarchi, directed by Magizh Thirumeni. The film begins as a romantic drama centered around a husband and wife, but then transforms into a thriller. By the time you settle into this new premise, the film shifts its focus to a suspenseful drama based on a racket. Before you can start to consume that, it turns out to be a mass action flick. Tell me, how can a film be so diverse every half hour and end up becoming a mess of multiple genres?Vidaamuyarchi starts off with a happily married couple, Arjun (Ajith Kumar) and his wife, Kayal (Trisha Krishnan). Twelve years after the marriage, the two begin to create distance between them, and Kayal asks for a divorce. Arjun accepts and requests one final drive with her as she prepares to move to her parents' house. During the ride, Kayal is kidnapped by a gang. When Arjun finds the culprits, he is told that it was all orchestrated by his wife. The gang leader gives Arjun a second chance and demands he arrange Rs. 8 crore for his life, and ultimately, his wife's life as well. Will Arjun be able to escape this trap?Based on Jonathan Mostow's Breakdown, this adaptation also has issues with the screenplay. The emotional connection with the characters is missing, as they fail to evoke sympathy in your hearts. Kayal is having an extramarital affair, so it doesn't really matter if she reconciles with Arjun again; and even if she does, why should Arjun take her back? He didn't engage in any illicit activity, so just for the sake of love...? Wait, that sounds too generous and feminist. Arjun was a simple common man; then how did he suddenly become so violent and skilled in combat? Just half of Deepika's face is burned with acid, and she dies the next minute-really? The cops working for villains have become a regular joke nowadays. It is not about how many times the film attempts to transition into a new genre; it's about how messy and confused it appears during those momentsThis isn't a performance-driven film, so better not expect anything that good from the leading duo or the other cast members. Ajith, trying to portray a poor, helpless guy, isn't suitable for his image, and when he starts banging baddies, it looks forced. The performance is fairly decent, but nothing notable. Trisha is the same married woman we have seen portray before, so there is no variety from her side either. Regina Cassandra is too attractive to suit a cruel villain; Arjun Sarja's looks work and nothing else. Arav, Nikhil Nair, Ganesh Saravanan, and Dasarathi walk out without much effort on display. There is not much for the rest of the supporting cast, so let's skip mentioning them.Vidaamuyarchi's first half takes too long to set the plot. The second half is faster-paced and more engaging, with action scenes serving as a saving grace. That action block inside the car is the major highlight. Om Prakash's cinematography is strictly okay, while Srikanth's editing should have been more effective in the first half. The production design was much better than other mindless South masala films. Coming to Magizh Thirumeni's direction, this is where the film faltered the most. It seems to be lost in its own mess of whether to become a niche romantic drama-thriller or a massy action-thriller. Magizh wraps things up in a hurry toward the end, which is an indication of an incompetent vision. Overall, Vidaamuyarchi has a few moments of standard heroism for Ajith's fans, but for that, they have to endure the rest of the poor show.RATING - 4/10*",

        "title": "Way better than AK's last few outings, but that's not enough. [+60%]",
        "content": "Magizh Thirumeni reimagines Breakdown for Indian audiences, but given the film is completely shot abroad (in Azerbaijan & Thailand), the Indianness is restricted to the lead characters. This itself can lead to a disconnect between the characters and the audience, but Magizh gives it just about enough flavour and seasoning to keep the film engrossing. When I say flavour and seasoning, I don't mean it in the \"masala movie\" sense. Breakdown was a clean and crisp action thriller centered around a kidnapping, with a fantastic Kurt Russell spearheading the proceedings. Vidaamuyarchi takes the core of the aforementioned flick and adds some layers, characters, songs, and subplots. Do these extra fittings bode well for the film overall? Not really.For instance, Ajith Kumar takes a long while to become the Batman to Arjun's Joker and Regina's Harley Quinn when it could have been executed sooner and with greater impact. The first 20-30 minutes set up the characters of AK and Trisha in the style of a yesteryear GVM romance, though nothing is noteworthy in this section except for both the leads looking dashing. Right from the get-go, this doesn't feel like a film made for fans of Ajith, as the cinema hall went silent for the entirety of the first half.When the thriller bit got going, the film had me hooked. Most of Breakdown's first act takes place in this film's pre-interval portions. The Azerbaijan terrain looks amazing on screen, and DoP Om Prakash has captured both the locales and characters in a terrific fashion. The Azerbaijani actors, as expected, aren't great and falter especially in the second half. An entire (domestic abuse) subplot regarding an Azerbaijani family plays out in front of us with absolutely no effect. The side villains (Aarav Kizar and a few others) are also poorly enacted, making them AK's beat-em-up fodder in the second half. Supreme Sundar is behind the stunts-that Thallumaala car fight gets an encore here.AK looks and moves considerably slower in the film compared to Thunivu, and while that works in not portraying him as an invincible beast, I feel some of the action choreography could've been executed with greater finesse, especially in the climactic showdowns (including avoiding the typical, dilapidated factory-like location). Also, the writing goes kinda haywire with the villain origin stories and the previously mentioned useless subplot, extending the runtime further. The worst (and most confused) writing treatment is meted out to Trisha, whose character is used as a red herring at one point. Some needless twists further water down the narrative.I think Breakdown has a more powerful (way more thrilling + practically difficult) action-packed final act compared to Vidaamuyarchi, which is very straightforward 2020s-Tamil-cinema-esque. Anirudh once again delivers spectacularly when it comes to the background score, and among the songs, Pathikichu is an absolute treat to listen to in Dolby Atmos. On the whole, I feel Vidaamuyarchi worked better than most of AK's recent outings for me, yet is not a patch on the much superior Breakdown.P. S. Arjun scores over AK in their dialogue-heavy scenes.P. P. S. Regina Cassandra, as a femme fatale, is HOTüî•, and the prosthetic work in her final scene is well done.",

A bunch of ninjas in mask and Du-rags, yes i said Du-rags) wearing bulletproof vest that die from every bullet. Or a Martha Stewart cleverer kitchen knife that struggles to slice through humans but can slice through and kill said bulletproof vest and suddenly can break a sword. The reviews about it being bloody are correct. But entertaining is a big stretch , unless you have low standards. Suddenly the guy that has so much skill that he sliced off his arm with ease leans into the whole \"he's a demon\" bit, and without some impressive move , power up, or clever tactic goes down after stabbing him, cutting off his arm, then stabbing him again. So he can barely stand, but I'm guessing the demon gives him extra strength and speed that we can't see. This movie is an insult to our senses and intelligence.",

But a shot in the head don't equal dead - it only puts him in a coma for twelve years - it is decided minus any evidence of course - that he killed his wife and daughter and then turned the gun on himself. Nevertheless he is released from a medical prison, in a wheelchair, dribbling - eating mush.But hang on - is that a finger I see twitching. It sure is - and when a bad guy tries to kill him he falls out of his hospital bed and enters into a fight with the bad guy which he wins - then he exits the hospital on his own two legs which still work after twelve years of muscle wastage - within a few scenes he is back to fighting fit and doesn't he fight. What follows is him taking on endless numbers of armed thugs and winning - in fights that never seem to end. Then he is told that his daughter is still alive and in the care of the thug who killed her mother. Oh gosh - more bloodletting until he has a fight with the major villain who chops off his arm - but oddly the stump doesn't bleed.I guess if you turn your brain off and just bathe in the endless blood you will be happy - I wasn't.",

        "content": "This is a pure action movie. If you're a fan of high-octane, adrenaline-fueled films-especially those in the vein of John Wick-this is the one for you.From the very first scene, the film wastes no time in delivering a nonstop, visceral experience that's all about the action. The focus isn't on a convoluted storyline or intricate character arcs; instead, every minute is dedicated to over-the-top, meticulously choreographed fight scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.The acting in this film is intentionally exaggerated, embracing an overacting style that is a trademark of many JP movie productions. In this case, the performances are even more pronounced than usual, adding a heightened sense of drama and intensity to every encounter. The leads seem to operate on a different level of physical and emotional commitment, as if every punch, every fall, and every moment of defiance is played out with a kind of comic book bravado. This overacting isn't a flaw-it's a deliberate choice that heightens the film's larger-than-life appeal and pays homage to the hyperbolic style seen in many classic action flicks.One of the standout features of this film is its action scenes, which are nothing short of superb. The film is packed with an array of action set-pieces that span from close combat and even some gravity-defying stunts that defy logic. There's an authenticity to the mayhem-each scene is saturated with raw energy and intensity that brings the audience directly into the chaos.A notable aspect is the film's unabashed use of blood and violence. The director doesn't shy away from showing the gritty consequences of every conflict; in fact, the splashes of blood add to the raw, unfiltered realism of the action sequences.If you're tired of movies that overcomplicate their narratives and just want a straightforward, heart-pounding ride, this movie delivers exactly that. It's the kind of film you can watch purely for the spectacle, the choreography, and the bold, unabashed portrayal of violence and heroism.In summary, this movie is a must-see for any action aficionado. If you love the visceral thrills of John Wick and enjoy the heightened style of overacting typical of JP movies, then prepare yourself for a film that's bursting with energy, blood, and excitement from start to finish.",

However, this particular movie doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief-it expects you to abandon all concepts of reality entirely. The main character has been completely brain-dead for 12 years, which means his muscles would have atrophied to the point of uselessness. There's absolutely no way he would be able to move, let alone function normally. And yet, the moment he sees someone significant, he magically wakes up as if nothing ever happened. On top of that, he gets shot, beaten in the head, and even stabbed-injuries that would instantly kill a normal person-but somehow, he just keeps going without any real consequences. The pacing of the movie is also painfully slow, with long, drawn-out sections of meaningless filler between the action scenes. I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but this movie was so unbelievably bad that I couldn't let it go without saying something.",

I appreciated what they wanted to do but everything just seemed to be clean and co-ordinated too much. Why is that guard doesn't have a gun and that one does? And the movement is too over the top to be taken seriously. And I guess I just laughed more compared to like other movies. I feel like I'm watching a 90s action movie.I do appreciate at some of the idea.

Sakata (T√¥ma Ikuta) is a hitman (on one last job), he carries out a contract to basically wipe out a Yakuza clan but is himself betrayed by the new Yakuza lords of Shinjo City, his family killed and left for dead. After 12 years in a prison hospital he is released to the care of a friend, though he is still brain damaged and largely immobile. Attempts on his life result in his resuscitation and he is soon slaughtering his enemies. He is more than just an Asian John Wick though, he seems to survive increasingly fatal wounds along with slaying hordes of his foes. There is a legend that every 50 years a Demon will arise in Shinjo City to go on an unstoppable killing spree, the Demon mask wearing Yakuzas fear that Sakata is that Demon. Political and police corruption along with people trafficking, drug dealing and extreme gore and violence combine to make Demon City into a disturbing film. The fights are wonderfully choreographed though, exceeding even the John Wick series with the attention to detail: there are so many different ways to decapitate a man. While it might be derivative it's well worth watching. It has a few interesting plot twists. Directed by Seiji Tanaka, Written by Tanaka and Masamichi Kawabe. On Netflix. 7.5/10.",

Sure his familly is murdered but outside of that, you see so little of that guy and he pretty much have the personnality of a broom, so its hard to care.As for the rest, well sure there is some decent action with no refrain on blood and violence, but its like the movie never decide what it want to be. Is he supernatural or just a man? Is this a serious revenge flick or its supose to be goofy (despite the violence). It never decide.You really have to turn your brain off to enjoy it even middly.

The factory fight had glimpses of promise as well as the staircase scene, but far too many terrible effects were present for it to really shine.The entire movie feels like it was filmed with a handheld Sony camera on a tripod. None of the scenes feel natural and all the awkward acting had me wondering if everyone on set hated each other. The main character has ZERO personality and doesn't feel like he belongs in his role. Everyone speaks like robots and delivers their lines like they are reading them for the first time.Final fight was terrible, main character just withering in pain entire time and seemingly immortal to all the mortal wounds suffered.The only things I liked were the demon masks, the very few glimpses of actual good choreography there were..... and that's pretty much it.

        "content": "I can finish this review in two sentences. The action of this movie is creative. But it is paced like it was made by Daniel LaBelle. If you want a more dense review then read the rest.This movie was really mid from the beginning. The first scene was the typical yakuza getting hunted type of scene. The difference is, all the enemies are dumb. They jump on the MC like they don't have some fire arms. They work separately instead of taking ground and spraying at him. Ok maybe I except it for the yakuza as they work like gangsters. But when they enter one of the cars and the driver was dead. So they decided to hide the leader in a closed house while the MC kept killing for a couple of minutes until he reached them, instead of throwing the dead carcass and drive the car. Like come on.The scene were the demon mask gang jumped on the MC home and killed his family even though he retired just to clean the city from demons (this is one of the biggest stupidest baloneys I have ever heard). Tried to kill the MC but somehow he survived and got paralyzed. They kept him alive. None on this make sense. But I will forgive them.This movie housed a lot of problems. One of them is the enemies always jumping on him. The big plot armor for the MC. The ending was meh but I will count it as a problem. Last and not least the noradrenaline of the devil. He got hit hundred and hundred of times. Yet he stands up and fights like a monster or a demon (the whole point of the movie). There is a limit to \"ok I will allow it\" as he kept swinging like a beast and driving a car and losing a lot of blood. Still he kept going.But the action had some creative and lovely scenes. Like the time he hit a fire distinguished. Got it stuck in the blade and used it to throw it on them and gain the upper hand. The cool cutting scenes. It almost felt like he was cutting through the screen. I really liked it. The blood spraying all over the place in a good gentle yet chaotic touch. These the reasons that kept the movie alive and gave it a better rating than what I should have gave it.",

        "content": "I initially gave this a seven because the action scenes were pretty good. However, at times he did have supernatural strength, which was cool to watch, but not believable. I ended up giving it a six and after writing this review, I might actually go down further. First off, I just wanna talk about the blooper before I forget to mention it. There was a scene where they were fighting in the living room. Out of nowhere, someone wearing blue jeans and a blue sweater gets off of the couch and runs to the right with their head down. I don't know how this was allowed to be in the final edit. Why didn't the director just re-shoot after the crew-member was caught by the camera? I watched it like seven times and shake my head every time.OK, let's get to it! Why kill this man to begin with? He did a job for you through an intermediate. There was no loose end. If the issue was a loose end, the one to kill would be the intermediate. Also, if the hitman was the main target, why wait until he got home and kill his whole family? When they were in his house, they said that they wanted to stop this demon who comes out every 50 years to go on a killing spree. How are they in the saving lives business? That's clearly not who they are. They are a criminal enterprise that hired a hitman to kill their competition. So why are they taking it upon themselves to stop a demon before he arises in order to save others?There needs to be more details as to why they feel as though this particular man is the man that they are looking for. Why is he the one to become this demon? Also, if that guy is supposed to be the demon, why do you feel the need to kill his innocent wife and very young child? Also, after they realized that they did not kill him. Why was the order not to finish the job? Are they trying to stop this demon or create this demon? This man was also catatonic for 12 years. They had ample time to stop this demon if they really wanted to.Also, what happened to the last demon? What are the details surrounding that? Who was this demon? What did they do? How was it received by the city? Who is telling this myth and what does this criminal enterprise have to do with it? It would make sense that the twin brothers lost their grandparents because the last demon killed them. So they were trained in martial arts by their parents and also trained somehow of finding the next demon so that they could stop them. That would make more sense. Also, one brother could have been very vocal about killing the demon while the other brother was always intrigued by the fantasy of fighting the demon one on one to test his skills and see if he was better than him because he always strived to be the best. Then the movie could have focused a lot more on the brothers and how they loved each other, but didn't see eye to eye. This also would've made more sense at the end of the movie where one brother assumed the identity of the other one because he was never in the spotlight because of his brother. That would've been a more well rounded movie. It would've showed him getting what he wanted at the end right before being struck down by his own hubris. It could've been that he was the one that saved the daughter just for her to strike him down because he became the monster he always thought his brother was and them realizing this in his last moments.Getting back to the timeline, when they approach the house and killed the family, was this 50 years after the last demon? Because the events of this movie don't start until 12 years after the initial scene. And if that's the case, this would be 62 years after not 50. And if it was less say 38 years then they were way early. Also, if he is now retired, why would he become this demon they are trying to stop?Also, would like to know the main character's background. How was he so good? How did he know his handler and for how long? That would've made a bittersweet moment when he killed him to know that they were childhood friends and also the kid's godfather. Also, why did he give them up to begin with? What was he getting out of it? Why was this the main character's last job? Was his wife not comfortable with this? Did she just find out and demanded that he stop? Did he just come to the realization after experiencing a life-changing event that made him want to no longer continue? How good was the money after being this elite assassin for I'm guessing a long time? Do they know him in this community? Does he have a military background? Was he a street kid? How was he trained? Why does he prefer blades? Is there a specific reasoning behind this? In almost 15 years no one has found his weapon stash? If that was a space he was paying for, he was no longer making those payments. How is that still there? If he was not paying for that space then it runs the risk of anyone going in there, taking the weapons, taking the car, taking whatever else he might have there. So by the time he came back 12 years later, there should be nothing left. I don't know. Maybe he owned it out right. Also, when he took the car to go to his last job, the door never closed. I was waiting for it to close and it never did. I don't have much to say about that. I just thought it was weird that you wouldn't just click the garage door button and close the door.Also, shouldn't he be in jail after being framed with the killing of his family? Let's also get into how the reporter said he killed them both. How Sway!? The daughter was fine.OK, and I know I'm leaving a lot of stuff out, but I think I'm just gonna stop now. The action was cool but the movie left me with a lot of questions that were unanswered and after writing this, I'm dropping it down to a five. I knew that would happen.",

        "content": "The obvious comparisons between this, the Crow, John Wick, and Kill Bill are already out there. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't come close to matching the style, action, or storytelling of those it apes. It starts off reasonably well with the tried and tested tale of an assassin double-crossed, and put out of action by an evil gang of criminal with a plan. Sadly, the comeback of our hero takes a little too long and doesn't really make much sense. Once he's up and running though, it's a non-stop rollercoaster of retribution. Unfortunately, the rollercoaster is a bit wonky and silly. Such as the unbelievably poor aim of the bad guys who are often are running towards the hero with a gun only to be whacked with his weapon of choice, a machete. He can shoot too, and when he does he hits every target perfectly. Which raises the question, why wouldn't he just use a gun all the time! Obviously the machete is his gimmick, but it's a silly one, and makes little sense. Then there's the music. It's bad. Insufferable in places. Think along the lines of John Woo, where the music is supposed to elevate a scene, but it comes across silly and cringe. There's constant twangs from a guitar that may well be part of The Crow influence, but it doesn't fit at all with this story, and it sounds amateurish. The acting is fine and there are some okay action sequences, but overall it can't keep up with its ambitions and falls flat because of its failings. There's far worse action movies, but there's also far better.",

Japanese movies have really upped their action quality (for example the live action The Fable movies, Yu Yu Hakusho, Rurouni Kenshin). However the zombie-style fights and gunplay were lazy choreographed. I'd rather watch Man From Nowhere again just to get this movie out of my mind.

You accept the terms of the movie beforehand, which means you don't question them later.We always do that when watching animated, science fiction or fantasy movies. So this one is no different. It is as far fetched as you could possibly imagine, but if you have accepted the T&C beforehand, then you can sit back, relax and enjoy some really fun entertainment.This is a Japanese, hardcore version of John Wick. It is bloody, and even though it is shot in hyper-realistic mode, its storyline isn't meant to be realistic, nor even plausible. It's a stage for the numerous action sequences, which are very well choreographed and filmed, with gallons of blood flowing, and bad guys that are REALLY bad and won't balk at killing anyone - and I mean ANYONE - that's in their path.The title already tells you that this city has at least one demon, and while the bad guys are all obviously impersonating demons, you get to a point where you start wondering if the \"good\" guy (who's a ruthless killer himself) isn't an actual demon. That would explain why he manages to survive some of the most unlikely - and nasty - wounds. Yet, he is never portrayed as a demon... but you get to wondering nonetheless.As I already stated, the action sequences are well made, well lit, accompanied by music that's appropriately angst-ridden to support them. The carnage, however improbable it gets at some point, is never boring.I really enjoyed this one. It's the kind of stuff that would make Tarantino proud.",

He doesn't really change much by the end of it and falls into the same pattern so story wasn't very rewarding or believable due to not enough depth especially with how easily his wife runs back to his bad behaviour. All this was to me is some pretty funny moments but story needed to be better.Dialogue was very British but relied way too much on the C word.Danny Dyer was a pleasure to see at the premiere and the director and they were solid with an entertaining performance and a creative quirky film.A movie made for the British football crowd who this story is about.",

Given six weeks to clean up or face jail, Jack's chaos unfolds with wit and grit. Dyer's in top form, breaking the fourth wall with cheeky asides that inject playful energy-his cockney charm and comedic timing make Jack a mess you can't help but root for. Love's script takes a fun stab at British politics, mixing satire with serious undertones about a fading subculture (or is it just suppressed by media?). It's nostalgic yet critical, mourning a generation left behind. The cast shines: Leonidas balances exasperation and warmth, Bell oozes menace, and Calum MacNab's wild Kenny Boy steals scenes. Love directs with flair, capturing gritty pubs and brutal brawls-scored by Alfie Godfrey's pulsing beats. Dialogue crackles with profanity-laced zingers, and quiet moments, like Jack with his son (Arty Dyer), add surprising depth. It's not perfect-pacing dips, some jokes push boundaries-but its unapologetic spirit, led by Dyer's swagger, makes Marching Powder wildly fun.",

Especially when his father in law wants him to look after his crazed brother in law who has a habit of attacking and robbing drug dealers. Dani also wants more from life and goes back to Art College. An extremely violent, foulmouthed film, a romcom, a dark comedy, just a comedy anyway at times. The backstory really demands for Jack and Dani to be 35 for it to make sense but even the great Danny Dyer can't pass for 35 without CGI. Still, it's worth watching.

He loves his wife and son, but he loves cocaine just that little bit more. But when, following a football brawl, a judge gives him 6 weeks to sort himself out or face 5 years, in prison, he figures he ought to make the effort - after all, he is 45. But all the temptations are still there. Plus, as quid pro quo for their rent-free home, father-in-law has tasked him with looking out for his wife's brother Kenny Boy, who happens to be schizophrenic, with a tendency to attack people.Danny Dyer plays Jack in a film which has vast amounts of profanity (including more use of the C-word than I have ever encountered before - I read 45), not to mention the drug use and violence. I have mixed feelings on bad language - it has its place but often adds little - and I don't regard drugs and violence as things which make life more worthwhile. Yet I really enjoyed this film.Why?First it's very funny. The humour is coarse, and often fairly savage, but I laughed out loud a number of times, and that doesn't happen very often. Second, Jack recognises that the cocaine and fighting will destroy his marriage, family, security, and everything else that matters in his life. He's trying to fight, but the things which tempt him are still there. I can identify: I didn't give up smoking at the first attempt. Or the tenth. Third, there's something about most of the characters which couples awfulness with likability. Even the problematic Kenny Boy acknowledges his issues and wishes he didn't have them.Danny Dyer does well here. It's a part which suits his established persona, to be sure, but his line delivery works, especially when he is making sly, confidential asides directly to camera.This film has heart - tentative, awkward, and tied together at the ankles - and a bit of social awareness.",

For a British film, this has to be one of the more heavily advertised films I've ever seen - so much so that I almost didn't feel the need to actually see it, I'm so familiar with it's comedy beats.Jack (Danny Dyer) has enjoyed a life of drugs, lager, porn and football violence for most of his life. Arrested following a fight in Grimsby, he avoids jail on the understanding that he'll start to turn his life around. Truth be told, Jack is starting to consider that perhaps he's getting too old for this life anyway. He's relationship with wife Dani (Stephanie Leonidas) is struggling due to emotional absence and his lack of libido. His father-in-law (Geoff Bell) hates him, and his son (Arty Dyer) is starting to show worrying signs of following in his father's footsteps. But will his friends, and his own anger issues, allow him to change?The familiarity of the film perhaps extends beyond the oft repeated trailer. Both Dyer and Nick Love have been making films and TV in this South London; casuals; drugs and violence genre for years, with neither perhaps finding the respect they are due for continuing to work, if nothing else. \"Marching Powder\" is a little different because, despite how the adverts have mocked romantic comedies, that's what the film really is. It hinges not on whether he will avoid prison, but can he save his marriage. There are sub-plots though, some of which contain some genuinely disturbing moments that work alongside the comedy.Dyer is quite good in this. Admittedly he's playing an aging out 'wide boy', whilst at the same time aging out of playing 'wide boys'. But it's a gutsy performance that exposes himself quite a bit.Ultimately, like a lot of Love's films I've felt, it doesn't really add up to all that much. It hinges on a moment of violence that should, perhaps, be the final push that Jack needs but, ultimately, we do leave him pretty much as we found him. There are a few laughs along the way though.",

There's no mistaking what you're going to get here and the opening sequence (both animated and live action) ensures you know exactly what the next 90 minutes are going to be like. It covers quite a bit within that shorter run time and always remains engaging even if it's undoubtedly frustrating to watch the cycle repeating itself so many times.Danny Dyer's character doesn't make a strong case for any potential redemption or forgiveness so his natural charms are working overtime to keep him likeable which is the sole reason he remains a watchable presence. Every time he breaks the fourth wall it works and his self deprecating nature is also a big help. Stephanie Leonidas is the sole heart of the film as she gives Dyer too many second chances without being naive about the chances of success.Nick Love's direction manages to maintain the playful nature throughout, starting strong with an animated fairytale opening and then finding various ways to include equally fantastical flourishes. It's a hard tone to balance, moving back and forth between brutal gang violence and more lighthearted relationship shenanigans but it does a pretty good job of handling the tonal shifts. Simon Stolland's cinematography definitely helps by employing chaotic camerawork for the fights.",

Not as simplistic as it sounds, the film is well made and created in an unusual way, with filmmaking methods not seen very often. Opens as a cartoon with a character backgrounder! That sounds stupid, but it's well done and fits well with the film's slightly crazy feel.The toxic masculinity is not the woman-hating kind, far from it, this is men in self-destruct mode, alienated from a society they don't seem to understand anymore. How do they cope? Football tribalism, violence, substance abuse, outrageous banter and a total lack of restraint. Some are trapped in their lifestyle no doubt, and the central character played by Danny Dyer has a number of redeeming characteristics. He loves his wife with a passion, he gives to the homeless, he looks after a troublesome relative, he wants to improve himself.Very fast-paced film, you won't be bored, you will be shocked, you will be entertained. This film will endure long after it's cinema release and may reach cult status simply because it's refreshingly different and asks a lot of questions about men and society.On another note, would be curious to know which 'lower league' football team their team is based on. The Fox pub which is their base is actually the Admiral Vernon pub in Dagenham, but of course it's just used as as set rather than indicating where they are supposed to be based in the film narrative.",

But, when he makes a film with Nick Love, it's usually quite the watch.

        "content": "Epic high octane film, with a relentless pace and outrageous black humour. Lots of alternative narrative techniques to tell the story from animation to \"breaking the fourth wall\" (look it up!) which is reminiscent of the UK TV series Lovejoy for instance. I suspect film students would enjoy studying this film, it has a unique feel.Dark, witty humour, but drama too, sometimes quite painful but offset by the humour. Some fabulous characters, some lovable rogues and some not so lovable! It's a Rom-Com too but mainly it's about male angst, excessive testosterone trying to fit into a changing society, and failing spectacularly! Some of the scenes and dialogue are quite risqu√© to put it mildly, and that was after cuts were forced on the film.It will upset some people and that I suspect is the reason for some of the low ratings, in a nutshell the film is 'offensive' by the standards of 2025, and some will see it as a bit 'Andrew Tate', but I don't think it is. The main character is a man who loves women, i.e his long suffering wife. He does not hate women at all, he just finds it hard to relate or express himself. As a follower of 'lower league football' myself I see lots of reality in the football scenes although that kind of hooliganism is very rare now, although I don't doubt it still exists and I can see the types, obsessive people perhaps more hooked on the away travel, drinking and whatever else than the actual football itself!In summary, how not to live your life, but a fascinating study of people living the only life they know with few inhibitions or restraint. Great film, could be watched more than once, it will go under the radar at the cinema because of the cinema demographic but may be become a classic or even a cult film in the future. Lots of younger males may relate to aspects of the film but they won't go to the cinema to see it. Once it streams it will find a bigger and more appreciative audience...",

The film is reminiscent of hard-hitting, brutal & raw British films like the Rise Of The Footsoldier Films!Middle-aged Jack, arrested for drugs, strives in 6 weeks to repair marriage, curb bullying in-law, & guide stepbrother Kenny Boy, but his efforts fail as life spirals out of control!I found the film to be pretty good! I knew I would like it, though I wouldn't exactly say it was amazing either! Though I will say it's above average for definitely & one you'll laugh & cry at as the main man tries to clear up his football hooligan, thuggish, drink & drug taking life-style!The film is pretty engaging & has great characters played by great actors (including the man himself) & has plenty funny one-liners, jokes, scenes & dialogue in general, especially the narration & fourth wall breaking moments!The plenty of F & C words & blinding in this film, along with some strong drug use, sex, eye candy, adult humoured moments & raw violence! So, it's pretty full on & intense stuff! Just the way I like it to be honest!The films story may not be unique, but it's good stuff all round & has a decent ending to say the least! The runtime is 1 hour & 31 minutes (91 minutes) & has some good pacing too!Overall, it's a great British Drama film you'll enjoy!8/10.",

There is love, tragedy, tolerance, powerlessness, addiction and redemption there too. Some sadness must also be mentioned.The characters are real, often tragic, caught up in a life they seem unable to escape from. You can care about some of the characters despite their flaws. The awkward moments are made more palatable by the often laugh out loud dark comedy.Overall I would recommend this film, it could be watched more than once, it may even become a memorable film because it has a slightly unique feel to it.

        "content": "Marching Powder starts off strong with a captivating animated opening that effectively sets up its backstory with vibrant visuals and a hint of humor, providing a foundation for the rest of the film.However, the tone shifts abruptly with a rapid-cut, handheld fight scene that becomes uncomfortable to watch, especially on the big screen. The frantic pacing and shaky camera work is disorientating, pulling you out of the otherwise immersive experience.Despite what the trailer might suggest, there's much more to this film than meets the eye, and a large part of its emotional depth comes from the character of Dani, the wife. Her story and emotional journey add a layer of nuance to the narrative, making the film more than just a spectacle. Her strength and resilience give the movie a heart that might otherwise be lost amidst the chaotic scenes.In summary, Marching Powder is an unexpected gem with a unique opening, jarring but necessary fight sequences, and a powerful emotional core thanks to Dani's character. Don't let the trailer fool you-there's a compelling story here beneath the surface.",

        "content": "'Marching Powder' is exactly what one would expect from a Danny Dyer (and Nick Love) movie. I'm a little split on how I feel about it though. Most of the comedy is quite lazy and forced, though a couple of jokes did get a chuckle out of me; e.g. Dagenham.The fourth wall breaking is questionable, it kinda works for a few moments but is mostly ill-fitting and cringey. On the other hand, there is surprisingly one touching scene; it involves Kenny Boy on the blower, I genuinely felt it in the feels - very unexpected for a movie of this sort.As for the cast, Dyer is mostly good in the lead role; far from perfect, but he gives largely what you'd anticipate. Stephanie Leonidas does well, while Calum MacNab is initially iffy as the aforementioned Kenny but ends up being one of the better aspects of this 2025 release.All things considered, I think I do have to file this one under 'average' - rather than 'good'. It's somewhat of a close call granted, but I do believe that the cons outweigh the pros. The deciding factor is the plot, which basically finishes as it starts; barely any progress is made.",

In some regards, it feels like it's harkening back to the early days of Guy Ritchie, however, not even Danny Dyer's boyish charm and undeniable screen presence - when he does manage to recapture the raw intensity that made him a star in the first place - can redeem Director Nick Love's script. Maybe one day I'll actually bring myself to watch his remake of The Sweeney if only for the car chase the Top Gear lads directed. For all the foul-mouthed aggro, the predominant tone is one of mollycoddled smugness, aiming to shock by reviving taboo language and jokes about sitting on Gary Glitter's lap, it's more toothless than dangerous but I can't deny I still had a degree of fun watching Marching Powder. It's awful, don't get me wrong, but in that oh-so-special way that makes it endearingly crap than outright crap but maybe Danny Dyer should stick to popping up on Celebrity Gogglebox now and then.",

After getting caught up in his latest scrap, a judge orders him to get his life back in order to avoid a prison sentence. Over the coming weeks, he attempts to reconcile with his childhood love, Dani (Stephanie Leonidas), secure a construction job with Dani's dodgy dad (Geoff Bell), and reconnect with his son, whose hit double figures. But his connection with the psychotic Kenny Boy (Callum McNab) threatens to derail it all.\"Back in the good old days, when men had a c**k and women had a s**g...\" From the off-set, it's clear that the first collaboration between Danny Dyer and director Nick Love in well over a decade, somewhat unsurprisingly, isn't going to concern itself with any sense of political correctness. After all, who are either of them to disappoint their fan base, even in what are surely more sensitive, understanding times? But then, the film is an examination of a man whom time has passed by, and so it's all the more fitting.The reunion of the directing/starring pair feels framed as a follow up to their signature piece, The Football Factory, despite featuring completely different characters in a completely new setting. In contrast to TFF's flashy, frenetic approach to its characters, Marching Powder portrays an older, more beaten down man, more honestly shown as a desperate loser with little else in his life. The tone uneasily shifts between tongue in cheek humour and heavy, more reflective drama, without the most focused plot to keep you following to the end, but somehow it does.It's a throwback reunion of old faces of the British crime genre, in front of the camera and behind it, rebelliously non-PC, messy and incoherent, but funny and wild, pleasing to those it's aimed at. ***",

It reminded me of some of my life in south London. - the characters felt familiar, although the drugs weren't as prevalent. Having said that, it's about an underbelly of society \"geezers\" that's can't snap out of their youth and, in effect, their identity and self image created when they were young. It's about a lifetime of self destruction.The film also has another, softer side, with insight in to relationships, and to a degree, mental health.The acting (some of it just felt like people being themselves) was ok, with Dyer and Leonidis doing a decent job as a dysfunctional couple. A number of character cliches were successfully skewered - especially middle class and trendy types.This is a film about middle aged men escaping (or failing to) their youth and the collateral impact on those they love. It's almost a parable for one of the main challenges in western society at the moment.Worth a watch - but not for the sensitive!",

His wife \"Dani\" (Stephanie Leonidas) reckons he's a waste of space and his daily regimen of lager and sniff isn't likely to change that anytime soon. A bit of routine football hooliganism sees him in front of a magistrate who gives him six weeks to get himself sorted out, else he is going to prison. Can he wean himself off his old habits and try to be a better person/husband/dad? Maybe Nick Love thinks that a constant stream of expletives makes for a good watch, but this was just puerile. There's not an hint of subtlety, no depth to the characterisation and without a doubt, the best bits are in the trails. \"Jack\" is a thug with few likeable qualities, and the strength of the drama between him and his wife is thrown completely under the bus when an incident with their son (Arty Dyer) should have put an end to the whole thing, but somehow just gets forgotten as what passes for a plot marches on. The whole thing has a 1980s look to it - attitudinally and aesthetically, and the occasional witty asides to the camera soon wear thin as we are presented with a slew of folks you'd cross the road to avoid. There is some humour in the script, but nowhere near enough to sustain this for what seemed like a lot longer than 90 minutes. A definite victory for hype over substance, powdery or otherwise.

Not just the crude Marxist Classism but a more complex look at contemporary class prejudice in the UK that also squarely puts the fair share of the blame on the middle class in their complicity in allowing the powerful to demonise and exploit the working class since the 1990s.

        "content": "The cockney actor spent ten successful years in EastEnders and has had hit and miss projects since then, this was the first feature length film he had starred in a long while. It was described as an \"alternative\" romcom, I knew roughly what to expect and I gave it a chance despite some mixed reviews, written and directed by Nick Love (The Football Factory, The Business, The Firm). Basically, Jack Jones (Danny Dyer) is a middle-aged bloke who has a heavy cocaine habit (the title is a euphemism) and is a violent football hooligan often getting into aggressive fights with other team supporters. Following his most recent arrest for possession of drugs, Jack is taken to court and warned by Judge (Philippe Brenninkmeyer) that he has six weeks to turn his life around. He must find steady employment and stay clean, or he will face a long spell in prison. So that they can keep a close ye on his progress, he is also to attend couples' therapy meetings with his long-suffering wife Dani (Stephanie Leonidas), previously an aspiring artist. Jack's reasonably well-off father-in-law Ron (Geoff Bell), who runs a scaffolding firm, also wants him to look after her brother, the unhinged and bipolar Kenny Boy (Calum MacNab), who has been released. All Jack wants to do is join his mates boozing in the pub and travelling to football matches, but he is trying to give up drinking, settling for pear juice. Jack makes an effort to reconnect with Dani, although she is unconvinced that he can change, and he spends more time with their eleven-year-old son JJ (Arty Dyer, Danny's real son). It is Ron holding him and Dani together financially, but he threatens and goads him often, hoping perhaps his failure will result in his daughter leaving him. There is an occasion when Jack surprises Dani with a romantic evening, and they have good sex, but things are bound to get in the way of their happiness. Jack finds employment in a Shoreditch coffee bar, but the attitudes of the customer anger him and he ends up getting into a scrape and losing this job. Eventually, Jack's old habits return when his friends, including Vinnie (Bailey Patrick), Jeff (Stanley J. Browne) and Roger (Dean Harrison) try to slip drugs into his soft drinks and convince him to join them at football matches, where they are certain to run into rival supporters. Jack goes all out and returns to snorting cocaine, and it appears he does not care if he gets in trouble. Meanwhile, Dani decides to try and go back to art college to fulfil her dream, and seemingly as an excuse to get away from Jack, even when he was trying to make things right. Whilst spending time with JJ, Jack becomes aware that Dani is at the college and is devastated that she may be cheating on him with her teacher. Jack decides to give up the drink and drugs again and try to get Dani back; he invites her to an Italian restaurant hoping she will show up. Dani initially rebukes him, and it looks like she may give into temptation and sleep with her teacher. However, in a Love Actually style moment, Dani appears outside the restaurant, and they write each other messages, him on napkins and her on her paper, before she walks in. They have a conversation, and Jack admits to treating her badly and not being a good husband, and she replies, \"You're a C-bomb, but your MY C-bomb!\" Six weeks have passed, the judge is satisfied that he has learnt from his bad decisions, having attended all his meetings with Dani and avoiding fights and drug use; Jack sees things on the mend in his life, but that does not mean he will be giving up football and it is likely he will still get into scraps. Also starring Lex Shrapnel as Vaughn, Janet Kumah as Gloria, Phillip Ray Tommy as Ziggy, Leon Dean as Fisher, and Daniel Fearn as Screw. Dyer breaking the fourth wall and playing the lairy geezer is likeable enough, Leonidas proves to be a tough cookie as his exasperated wife, Bell has his moments as the mean father-in-law, while McNab with his stupid bowl hairdo is chaotic and annoying. It is a rather simple story of a dude who must give up coke and booze to avoid trouble but fails miserably, the script has the occasional zingers and dark jokes, but it is overloaded with C-words that are incessant as opposed to funny, a below-average only just watchable comedy-drama.

        "content": "I had the honor and absolute pleasure of seeing \"Myth of Man\" at a theatre in Los Angeles while it was on its North American premiere tour a few days back in December. How I came across this gorgeous art-piece of a movie is an interesting story. A teaser for the movie hit Facebook and Instagram back in September and I was instantly intrigued. Later in October the official trailer dropped along with premiere dates. I saw a sole Los Angeles date and something told me I just HAD to see it so I bought tix for me and the wifey as soon as I could.Up until then I was totally unaware of Director Jamin Winans' work. An Internet search led me to \"Ink\", which I saw to familiarize myself. I quickly threw myself into that movie which was made on only $250,000, and had flashes of greatness all throughout; greatness which comes into full fruition with \"Myth of Man\". After seeing \"Ink\", I was definitely intrigued.Before I talk about the movie, I must say that Jamin Winans and his wife Kiowa are absolutely two of the nicest, down to earth, personable and *real* people you are ever going to meet! We were the first ones to check into the movie theatre for the showing and they both came up and introduced themselves and recognized me from some of my Facebook comments on the movie's site. We chatted both before the rest of the moviegoers arrived and after the Q&A session and they seemed genuinely thrilled to show their work and connect with fans. I learned that the film took 3 months to shoot and over 3 years to finish post-production due to Jamin and Kiowa doing all of the 3500 VFX sequences the movie featured BY THEMSELVES! Not only that, they also sold their house and moved to a family farm in Kentucky where they converted an entire barn into a green-screen studio. Talk about dedication!About the movie...The husband-and-wife team drop the viewer into a wondrous alternate world that is so similar to our own and yet so very different. The world the movie takes place in has elements of 1920's - 1950's noir; with dollops of steampunk, magical realism and bits of Bioshock Infinite thrown in for good measure. It has its own styles of architecture (often gravity defying!), its own unique physics and its own religion and mythology. In many ways, the Winans' have made this world into its own character in the movie.The movie centers around 4 main characters. Ella (played by Austrian actress Laura Rauch) is a talented artist who is gentle, loving soul. An eternal optimist who sees magic and possibilities everywhere. Seeg (played by Anthony Nuccio) is described as an \"art terrorist\", an artistic soul with a gruff exterior. Boxback (played by fellow Austrian actor Martin Angerbauer) is a bully and a thug with the ability to amplify his voice as a weapon. Finally there is Caley (played by newcomer Ian Hinton) who is a pickpocket and thief with a heart of gold; and, incidentally, winds up stealing almost every scene he's in with his playful manner and infectious grin.Only a minor spoiler is that this is a \"silent\" movie. There *are* sounds, sound effects and music. However, there is no spoken dialogue in the movie at all. The reason for this is made known early in the movie: the main character Ella is deaf and mute, and the sounds (or lack thereof) are filtered through her and her perception of the world. Whereas it might be a big ask to expect the viewer to sit through a silent movie, simply know that this movie packs an enormous artistic and emotional punch without a single word needing to be said.The story centers on Ella's insistence that she has received a message from the divine...from her creator; and this is where the movie's title comes into play. There is a creation myth which the people of this alternate world believes in which heavily comes into play in Ella's motivations. The creator is believed to be represented by a divine comet that speeds through sky every day during this world's very brief night. The creation myth extolls that the creator's children can make contact with the divine by singing the correct song to it, and Ella spends most of the movie trying to collect enough songs of the people to attempt to make contact.This is, of course, an over-simplification of the plot but I don't want to spoil anything. What I will say is this.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long while. There are so many details in the world the Winans' have created. You can easily lose yourself trying to figure out how things work in this world! The movie answers many questions, but leaves SO MANY MORE open for interpretation. The same goes with each of the main characters. You think you know each one at first blush, but wind up learning so much more as the story progresses.Anyone who is familiar with Jamin Winans' other works also knows the importance of music in his movies, and the same is true in \"Myth of Man\". Mr. Winans often composes the score to his movies as he's writing them; thus the music itself often becomes a movie character, making each scene more emotionally impactful.I'll be honest, I spent most of my time watching this movie with my mouth slightly open and in awe trying to take all the details in. There is so much to see, hear and feel in this movie and yet none of it is overwhelming. I was swept along the story and when it was over I hear myself audibly saying \"Oh my god..!\" at the end. This is a story about love, loss, religion (small r) and...most importantly...human connection. It's a movie you will want to see multiple times to see what you may have missed the last time.In short, Jamin and Kiowa Winans have created a masterpiece of a movie that reminds us of why we love to go to the movies. To sit in a darkened theater for a couple hours and be completely spellbound by a story and experience that will linger in your mind long after the end credits roll.",

        "content": "This film swims in the same waters as \"City of Lost Children\", \"Brazil\", and Chaplin's \"The Kid.\" The visuals and invention are stunning - a world of brass fixtures, steam-powered dreams, and impossible architecture that defies gravity itself. The steampunk aesthetic extends beyond mere set dressing into the very fabric of the storytelling, where each mechanical marvel serves a narrative purpose. But it's the actors who really make this thing fly, bringing subtle humanity to even the most fantastical sequences. The lead performances in particular find that delicate balance between whimsy and emotional truth, grounding the film's flights of fancy in genuine human experience. Full of heart and creative to the nth degree, \"Myth of Man\" proves there's still room for films that take bold risks while remaining emotionally resonant. The director's vision never wavers, crafting a unique cinematic language that speaks to both the imagination and the soul. A rare gem - I'm excited to see how audiences receive this boldly original work.",

It was quite epic and I look forward to a wider release so I can see it again.Listening to Jamin and Kiowa describe the journey to gettiing this to the release point was also quite interesting (there was a Q&A after the show), and it shows the incredible dedication they have to their art. I was a fan of theirs from The Frame, which is one of my favorite movies, but honestly, this one is even better than I expected.I just hope they keep putting out this quality level, because we are better for it.Edit: I just wanted to add my admiration for the actors as well, they played thier characters so well, I knew exactly what they were saying, without saying a thing. See this when you get the chance, I'm sure you'll agree,",

Having been a big fan of the unorthodox storytelling and cool visuals of \"Ink,\" I was very excited when I saw the trailer for this; however, I wasn't without reservations. Plenty of cool-looking films have turned out to be self-indulgent messes. I got a chance to attend a screening with some friends who were unaware of the Winans' other films and we were all blown away. While the film took a bit for me to become accustomed to its language, since it is entirely without dialogue/written word *and* is set within a sci-fi/fantasy world with its own rules, within 15 minutes I felt I was easily grasping most of what was occurring. Many elements of the world are presented without explanation, but the context clues lead me to so many a-ha moments that it feels like a lovingly-crafted puzzle. All aspects of design were very cool, in my opinion, as were the effects. The way the music/sound was integrated into the story worked well also. I was made to laugh and to cry at various moments, and I thought the ending was perfect. I can't wait to see it again, and I hope it is very successful. We could use more movies with such ambition and craftsmanship.",

        "content": "I had the privilege to see this in London. I was absolutely blown away by it. It was beautiful, moving, funny, sad.. I ran the whole gamut of emotions. Brilliant! My normal sesquipedalian loquaciousness fails me as I fail to grasp the words to give this visual feast the description it deserves! However I shall do my best.Firstly, it's a dialogue free movie. It's not a silent movie,there's lots of sounds and music, some of it diegetic. The music itself should be billed as one of the stars as it does so much work. It's a major part of why this movie works so well.Of course the heavy lifting is done by the cast. Without dialogue you're relying on their facial expressions and movements to convey their inner thoughts. The lead heroine was fantastic. But the other main characters aren't just window dressing. They all bring a lot to the finished product.The story is... well, it defies description. To even attempt to would do it a grave disservice. It's a work of art that needs to be experienced for the viewer to make their own opinions. Interpretation of the movie isn't strongly defined. It's up to the viewers to make up their own minds about the narrative.It has got a real steampunk vibe..sorry \"DieselPunk\" as I was reliably informed by the director. At times I got both Jacques Tati and Gaiman/Burton vibes. At times it reminded me of Mirrormask but it's a creature born of a unique birth. It's unique and stands on its own two feet.If you like thought provoking, artistic, moving and creative movies you might like this. It's a breath of fresh air from the usual cookie cutter junk food action movies. It's slower but every second is a mouthful to savour.",

        "content": "I'm going to have to make it clear from the start that I cannot do this film justice in my review. I am not skilled enough as a writer to be able to describe it and it deserves better words than I can throw together in my ham-fisted way, so what I'll try and do is explain why I like this movie so much and why and if that sounds like something that appeals to you then please go see it yourself.The reason it's so hard to describe is because the film makers have made their own world and that world is unfamiliar. It has a diesel punk aesthetic with ecchos of Fritz Lang's Metropolis or Dark City but it's not clear how it all works - there is no dialogue and it doesn't have exposition for the sake of understanding the film. What it has are characters - the people in the movie know what's going on and they are totally relatable.They have hopes, fears, they go on a journey. We see them navaigate their world, try to change it, try to change each other and it's magical and I have never been so engrossed in a story in my life at a cinema.We were lucky enough to have some time at the end for a Q&A with the film makers and lead actors and it felt like we could have been sat around a camp fire with them telling the story and they'd have begun as the light fades then we find ourselves cold, damp, the fire gone out and the sun rising at they finish theri tale but nobody would have noticed any of those things... the story is just so captivating.Will you like it? I don't know. I think people who are used to graphic novels will connect with it easier (I'm not a comic fan myself, but I appreciate how emotionally connecting an artform it is). Check out the trailer. Take a risk - it may be one of the most captivating films you ever see.",

This is a very mesmerizing piece of art and deserves to be seen!I just read a really negative review on here saying this is some sort of right-wing, anti-vax, pro-Christian, wet dream and wanted to respond -as one of the most pro-vax, non-religious, left-leaning people you'll ever meet. That review is complete nonsense!As with any art piece, there are about a million ways you can interpret anything. This movie isn't really political at all, at least not from a traditional ideology, and even if you DID want to put it in a political box, I'd say it is about non-conformity, rebellion, individuality, and acceptance - certainly not positions the US right believes in. Are there religious undertones? Maybe, if you are inclined to believe there are, you can find them. You can certainly find a \"higher-power\" but not a benevolent god one should worshipAt it's core, this is an incredible achievement in both aesthetic beauty and sound. It is a touching story of survival and friendship in a world gone mad. And it's all done with no dialogue. It's a two hour long sensory journey that you've never seen anything like before and may never see again. I would 100% recommend it.I really wish it had been released on more screens around the country because not seeing it on the big screen will most assuredly lessen the impact that it has on you.

For Indonesia and Malaysia cinema, which is its main primary target its 10/10.

It maybe understandable, its Aragao first film. (Joao Neves GF, Benfica players), there also Strates who is from South Africa. Muhammad Mansaray have the best acting skill among these newcomer.Horror AspectAt first those teenager are just regular high school student, some maybe spoiled by their parent but this time they must learn and fast.

I do not have any prior knowledge regarding film making but you don't have to be a chef to critique. There was hardly any introduction towards the characters and how they related to each other.

Or perhaps even how the friends were close to him since they followed the MC to spread his ashes. (also, at the end where the MC did manage to spread his ashes, the remaining friends did not even make it)The acting was weak and lack emotion. It really sounded and felt like the actors had just read the lines and said it out blatantly. The intensity and emotions were low. However, the actress who acted as Malika, did well as she was able to make that character stand out as a selfish and blame worthy person.The fear of planes for the MC wasn't even explained and was completely forgotten of as soon as they crashed. She suddenly evolved and became the leader. It seemed like they did not even have time to process what the hell had just happened.Also the portraying of how the chemical spread toward the water was barely captivating. It seemed like I was watching a music video with all the animations and colours.In the scene after they crashed and the co-pilot's body was just sitting up randomly seemed impossible as he looked hella unconscious.This movie seems to focus less on the crocodiles in terms of showing how fierce they are. The scenes seemed as if they did not have enough props to create more intensity.The crocs just come out of the blue and randomly which I get is because of the chemical, but it did not make sense when it was walking on some pipe or rail above Frank and took him down on one of the scenes.The horror/thriller aspect was not enough. The music in certain scenes did not match. However, in the beginning where the chomping began, the jumpscares were good, other than that it was just starting to get too predictable.All in all, i would rate the movie at a 1/5 stars as there were some satisfying scenes that needed to be applauded for. However, the movie just lacked the logic.",

I chose to watch just out of curiosity; less mainstream horrors are generally what I go for when I want an easy win that doesn't require a whole lot of effort on my part.This fit the bill and actually exceeded my expectations. Fun plot that I don't think is so far fetched that it becomes a joke. Some nice SFX that I reckon on a bigger TV than mine would actually look the business. Cool music and general vibe to the whole thing, layered over the ever topical struggle between us and the natural world.Overall I think The Bayou was well worth it.

        "content": "Review of \"The Bayou\" - A Disappointing ExperienceIt's hard to understand the purpose of this film or the message it's trying to convey. For instance, how did the protagonist overcome her fear of flying? How were the relationships between the characters developed? And why was \"Malika\" portrayed as such an unpleasant character without any logical justification or character development? My criticism isn't about her personality itself, but rather the lack of any reasoning or evolution that explains her behavior.As for the alligator scenes, they were utterly disappointing, with weak CGI that is unacceptable for a film released in 2025. Honestly, Godzilla looked more realistic than these creatures! The alligators were supposed to be the core element of the film, yet their poor execution made them look like cheap animation, completely killing any sense of danger.The plane crashing just minutes after takeoff? That was completely unrealistic, feeling like nothing more than a lazy excuse to push the plot forward without respecting the audience's intelligence. As for the acting, there wasn't even enough material to judge in some cases-Kyle and her brother's flashback lasted mere seconds and added nothing of real value. Meanwhile, the performances of the main cast were flat and unconvincing.More importantly, the film failed to evoke any emotions-no tension, no fear, no excitement... just a series of empty events. And that final scene with Frank-what was the point? Just to show that he wasn't dead yet? It added absolutely nothing to the story.As for the alligators' aggression, there was no explanation whatsoever, making the film's central threat feel meaningless.Honestly, this film wasn't worth the time, the money, or the effort of going to the cinema.Advice to anyone considering watching it: Don't.",

The Bayou fits the bill perfectly - it's a cheap and cheerful creature feature with absolutely no pretensions. It does exactly what it says on the tin and is actually better than I expected, with above average CGI for this kind of thing, a smattering of gore and reasonable performances.Athena Strates plays Kyle, who flies to the everglades with her friends to scatter the ashes of her older brother Jamie (Flynn Barnard). Disaster strikes when the plane experiences engine trouble and ditches in the middle of a swamp, where the alligator population has turned super-aggressive due to the powerful narcotic that was dumped in the water during a raid on an illegal drug factory.The film obviously won't win any awards for originality, but it's not trying to - it knows exactly what is required of it, moving swiftly along, delivering a few jump scares and a fair bit of suspense. And it doesn't scrimp on the gator action: there's numerous ravenous reptiles, both practical and computer generated, and they put quite a few similarly themed films to shame.6/10. Worth a go if it's a brainless, no-nonsense bit of fun you're after.",

It was a simplistic and straightforward script, and the writers didn't exactly bring anything new to the genre. Regardless, \"The Bayou\" proved to be an entertaining alligator movie.I was not familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list, but I found the acting performances to be good. I actually do enjoy watching unfamiliar talents on the screen whenever I sit down to watch a movie, so that spoke well in favor of \"The Bayou\".The effects in the movie were good, which is a must for a movie with killer animals. There is nothing worse than sitting down and watching a movie where the animals look like they were discarded from a 1990s computer game because they looked to fake. Luckily that was not the case in \"The Bayou\".If you enjoy killer animal movies, then directors Taneli Mustonen and Brad Watson does deliver an enjoyable movie with the 2025 movie \"The Bayou\".My rating of \"The Bayou\" lands on a five out of ten stars.",

        "content": "Gator Creek tries to be a fun, tense survival horror, but man... it just doesn't work. The story is super predictable, the characters are beyond annoying, and the only real highlight is the gator attacks.The plot is exactly what you'd expect-a plane crashes in the middle of a Louisiana swamp, and the survivors have to deal with some nasty, mutated alligators. Sounds cool, right? Well, it would be if the movie didn't follow every horror clich√© in the book. You can see every \"twist\" coming a mile away, and there's way too much talking and arguing between attacks.The worst part? The characters. Kyle, the main girl, is already hard to root for, but Alice and Zoe? Easily two of the most annoying characters I've seen in a while. Alice is whiny and makes terrible decisions, and Zoe is just flat-out unbearable... mean for no reason and constantly making things worse. Every time they were on screen, I was just waiting for a gator to do us all a favor.That being said, the kills are actually pretty solid. The gators look decent, and when they do attack, it's brutal and fun to watch. There's a good mix of practical effects and CGI. The CGI isn't amazing, but it gets the job done. A couple of the deaths are actually pretty creative too, which was a nice surprise.Overall, Gator Creek is just kinda meh. It's got some cool kill scenes, but the slow pacing, predictable story, and annoying characters make it tough to sit through. If you just wanna watch gators wreck some people, it's fine... but if you're looking for a good creature feature, there are way better options out there.",

        "content": "Let me start this review by saying that I am an absolute fan of survival horror, and I love movies where animals attack for some bonkers reason. So naturally, I was pretty excited to watch this. However, the ratings for this movie suggested it wouldn't be great, so I lowered my expectations before my viewing.The story follows a group of people who crash in a small plane in the wetlands of Florida, only to find themselves under attack from drugged-out alligators. The premise sounds hilarious and immediately reminded me of Cocaine Bear. However, this movie takes itself way too seriously, which harms the overall enjoyment, especially since it's not very competently made. The plane crash itself looked cheap and unconvincing, and the characters behave irrationally and stupidly. At times, it felt like a competition to see who could be the most unlikable, though one character was clearly way ahead of the others.The acting ranged from decent to a little poor, but I wasn't expecting much in that department. While the basic premise is fun, the movie doesn't do much with the idea. It had the potential to be much better, but weak characters, poor writing, and some subpar effects held it back. It definitely borrows elements from other films like Rogue, The Grey, the already mentioned Cocaine Bear, and even Jurassic Park III. Those are all movies I love, but this one fails to entertain in the same way.That being said, it's still a decent popcorn horror flick. If you don't overthink the logic or get too annoyed by the awful characters, you might have some fun with it. I overall enjoyed parts of it, and while the effects weren't great, they weren't Syfy-level bad either. The biggest downside is how unbearably stupid and annoying the characters are, making it really hard to root for most of them.If you're looking for a genuinely good horror movie featuring alligators or crocodiles, I'd recommend Rogue, which has a similar premise but executes it far better. However, if you're just in the mood for a fun action-horror flick with killer alligators, this might do the trick. [5,1/10]",

        "content": "Taking a scenic trip together, a group of friends take a plane trip through a local swamp to scatter a dead friend's ashes, but when an accident strands them in the swamp they find themselves stalked and killed by ravenous alligators protecting their territory from intruders and must band together to survive.Overall, this was a solid and entertaining creature feature. Among the better elements of this one is the generally cheesy and overall intriguing means that it goes about getting the setup for not just the ravenous gator attacks but also the group of victims out to the swamp. The initial idea of the gators getting poisoned with a special drug supply that's shown getting dumped into the river by a drug lord during a federal raid on the compound serves as a way to explain the extra aggression and unnatural activity exhibited here, which is quite fun to see play out. Likewise, the idea of the trip being undertaken to honor a friends' memory who had just recently died in an accident that was inadvertently their fault is enough of a reason to get them out into the middle of nowhere, especially with the sketchy behavior shown that they ignore to take the trip in the first place. That makes for a strong base to string the series of extended but no less intriguing attacks off of. The incidental crash and emergency landing in the swamp, which is then further impeded by the creatures trying to break into the wreckage to get at the last ones out of the plane, gives this a fine starting attack scene with the compounding chaos creating a lot to like. The first few encounters on land, taking out stragglers on the outskirts of the group or just emerging out of nowhere to snap at them, help out rather nicely, and the larger scenes have a lot to like. From the creatures chasing the group out of the woods to a flimsy shack for protection or an escape attack on a raft that gets ambushed and the slow-motion trek past the sleeping creatures, it manages to pull off a series of decent enough scenes that aren't entirely original but are serviceable enough, especially with the practical effects and gore over the CGI creations used elsewhere. These provide the film with enough to be enjoyable, while there are some issues with this one that hold it back. The biggest drawback with this one is the rather stifled pacing that makes everything feel quite sluggish and slow-going despite the quick running time. Focusing on the slew of issues it does with the main group who are going through the problems that they are, most of these make the group feel even more unlikable than they already are, which isn't a good look to things. With fidelity concerns in a relationship, past examples of cowardice being used to psychologically unravel people into activities that will compromise their safety unnecessarily, or featuring a twist ending that puts their behavior straight out of another movie entirely simply to have a surprising outcome featured, the group here is really hard to get behind and the film does little to make them any better the longer it goes on. Combined with the usual assortment of bad decision-making found in this particular genre and some generally underwhelming CGI for the crocodiles, this one does have some flaws to it.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

While the dialogue felt a bit wooden in a few places, it was actually quite strong overall.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.As an aside, many of the actors have worked together on other movies and two of the actors who play brothers in the movie are likely brothers in real life as they have the same last name.

Thx!Going into A Knight's War I was expecting a poorly told and poorly produced B Movie. Strangely that's not at all what A Knight's War is. Surprisingly it's really a pretty well made and well told fantasy adventure story.The Knight takes on an oath to save an innocent woman and fulfill a prophecy and from there an adventure to the depths of darkness unfolds.The film is genuinely well made. Is it perfect? Certainly not, and some small failures of editing make the story difficult to follow at first. But if you stick with it all makes sense as the story progresses.The scenes are convincing and the atmosphere is gritty and dark. This film constantly reminded me of the Dark Souls and Mortal Shell video games, which is definitely a compliment to it's art direction and Visual Effects.The script is competently written medieval fantasy and the actors portray their heroic characters with depth and gravitas. I was particularly impressed by the portrayal of a genuinely good and noble knight fighting against the forces of darkness in both his inner and outer world. And the female protagonist is convincing as a woman torn apart by the lust for revenge.This film is a genuine dark fantasy sword and sorcery and it's depiction of medieval knights and dark magic is impressive. Most of all it's a solid and exciting action adventure movie and a genuine effort to do the genre justice.Is it a bit rough around the edges? Sure, but it's merits shine through and make it an enjoyable watch with a satisfying story arc.A bit sad and unfair that the positive reviews of this film are being down voted just because it is a B Movie. Because actually, it totally deserves the positive reviews it's getting.If you like films like Solomon Kane, or Excalibur, then check out A Knights War. Give it a chance, it's a good watch! :D.",

Mad Respect!Now, let's be clear: if you're expecting \"Dhool 2.0\" or the emotional depth of \"Chithha\", you're looking in the wrong place. This is a wild, crazy ride, and Vikram as Kaali? He's an absolute beast.Picture this: a normal dude, just running his shop, gets sucked into this crazy criminal mess during the village festival. And his old boss, Ravi, played by Prudhvi, is reuesting him to save his son, Kanna, from this cop, Arunagiri (SJ Suryah), who's out for blood. Turns out, this cop wants to take them down hard, like, \"encounter\" level, because they totally humiliated him and his dad before. So, the whole movie is just this one wild night, seeing how it all goes downIf you crave that conventional mass entertainer, you'll eat this up. The entire cast crushes it, but SJ Suryah as the cop? Man, he's next level. And Suraj Venjaramoodu? Creepily brilliant.And the camera work? Brownie points for the single shot will be remembered as one the best sequence in the film.GV Prakash's music? Straight fire. It amps up the mass scenes, and there's a throwback to Vikram's \"Madhura Veeran,\" and the crowd went wild. Theatre was shaking, for real. Now I'm hyped for what he does with Ajith's \"Good Bad Ugly.\"In closing, \"Veera Dheera Sooran: Part 2\" is a banger. It has a few rough edges and loses momentum in places, but that doesn't diminish the overall movie experience. Just go in with the right expectations, ready for a wild ride, and you won't be disappointed to see Chiyaan back in a full-blown mass role. I'm already waiting for the prequel!",

Especially the police station sequence was well written and brilliantly staged by the director.Kilangu scene, pre climax portion, pre interval portion are the major highlightsOverall an fully satisfied movie from director SuArunKumar.",

        "title": "A Gripping Action Drama That Masterfully Balances Family, Ego, and Survival",
        "content": "Veera Dheera Sooran: Part 2 is a well-thought-out action gangster drama that includes all the right elements of a content-driven commercial film.The film's biggest strength lies in director S. U. Arun Kumar's ability to flesh out relatable, well-written characters and weave them into a compelling narrative that speaks volumes about human actions, their consequences, and, above all, survival instincts and it's effect on the element of family.While the film's premise might seem all too familiar as a template often seen in Tamil cinema- a hardcore guy who leaves behind a violent life is unexpectedly called upon to revisit his past to fulfill a favor for his 'ex-boss', where Arun excels as a writer is in his staging and world-building. We get all the expected commercial film tropes, but they come with depth, layers, and a portrayal of real-world issues faced by the highly convincing protagonist, Chiyaan Vikram, aka Kaali.Whether it's Kaali's helplessness, his love for his wife and family, his boiling rage, or his calm and collected nature, this is the Vikram fans have been waiting for. Unlike his previous roles where he physically transformed and embraced multiple avatars, Vikram here stays true to his strongest suit: portraying a common man facing uncommon problems.The actor is unstoppable. This is most evident in a brilliant single-shot sequence, where Kaali and Kannan (Suraj Venjaramoodu) are held captive, manage to flee from police custody, and ultimately find SP Arunagiri (SJ Suryah) wounded and hiding under a bridge, all ending with a crashing jeep that is up in flames. This entire sequence is masterfully shot, and Vikram's ability to emote - showcasing despair, helplessness, and subtle heroism - in the face of overwhelming circumstances is a testament to his talent.The film unfolds like a massive jungle filled with hungry 'animals,' relying heavily on its core characters' respective agendas. Each one is convincing in their respective roles, from the selfish 'Periyavar' (Prudhvi Raj) and the reckless son, Kannan, to the blindly loyal and malleable Venkat, and even Kannan's doting younger sister. The family dynamics and nature of each individual is crafted exceptionally well.On the flip side, though not much of a complaint, both Dushara Vijayan as Kalaivaani and SJ Suryah as SP Arunagiri, don't quite surprise us in their respective roles. They do justice to their characters, but perhaps their previous performances have set high benchmarks.That said, nearly everything that works for VDS: Part 2 can be credited to the strong screenwriting and the complementary cinematography. Despite nearly 80% of the film taking place at night in the dark, we never feel like we're missing anything visually.While not directly comparable, the film strongly evokes the feel of movies like director Suseenthiran's Paandiya Naadu (2013), Naan Mahaan Alla (2010), or even Pandiraj's Kathakali (2016), where intense and engaging events unfold around unassuming protagonists who are forced into a world of blood, violence, and survival to protect their families.The conflicts faced by our lead character and his family are well established throughout the movie. Whether it's the shift in Kaali's once cheerful family, the naming of his second child 'Dilip' in memory of his fallen friend, or the muscle memory that pushes the family to flee once again towards the end, it is clear that the 'scars of the past' still haunt them.And at the heart of it all is family - the glue that holds everything together. Every action taken by these ego-driven, rage-fueled men comes with a price, often paid by the family and women. Periyavar, for instance, says, \"Pulla usura vida maanam onnum perusu illai\" (Prestige counts for nothing when compared to your child's life). Even the selfish Kannan, in a moment of vulnerability, pleads with SJ Suryah's cop character, claiming he is a family man and can't die for that reason.Our protagonist, Kaali, too, repeatedly emphasizes safeguarding his family first amidst the chaos. These small but powerful moments highlight director Arun's writing prowess and his emphasis on the theme of family. The film is full of setups that pay off like a blast (no pun intended) in the end, most notably the tension surrounding the code worded 'kezhangu,' which is teased upon from the beginning.The director opens the movie with a note saying, \"Based on true events,\" and the deeper meaning of those words is reflected well. The film explores the idea that, beneath the violence, male ego, and gangsterism, the drive for revenge, blood, and payback often comes down to protecting one's family. What begins with a scene of a helpless wife searching for her husband, ends with a helpless husband/father searching for a new life for his family. The narrative's progression is convincingly conveyed through the writing.Overall, Veera Dheera Sooran: Part 2 is definitely a must-watch, as it balances the commercial appeal of a theater-worthy experience with a commitment to redefining what it means for a Tamil film to be hero-driven.While the necessity of a Veera Dheera Sooran: Part 1 prequel remains questionable, given the oversharing done in the flashback portions of the current movie, the existing 'Part 2' itself already does enough to successfully represent a drama-filled action entertainer.",

The way, the film shows the events of one night slowly giving the audience information piece by piece and letting us solve the puzzle for the most part while keeping the tension alive was so fun. The rawness of everything around was elevated by the great performances, obviously expected from Vikram but also most of the other cast. The flashback portion in the middle felt a little bit unnecessary and slowed down the film but the way it ended was satisfactory. The drama and the rawness were strong points of the film but the action itself was mostly just okay when everything surrounding it was really great. The action scene near the end was a bit of a mess. Narratively, it makes sense because how even at that point the characters are revealing their intents and character by their actions but it was shot in a weird way. The way a lot of small, small things are connected to the main story, a reveal at the very end which shows how everything happened because of coincidences that were meant to be and connected to each other way more than we thought was very interesting as well as giving a bit of levity after all the brutality.The decision to call this Part 2 still feels a bit gimmicky and just a promotion tactic. There's not really much need for a part 1 but if they make it, they better make it worthy of this.I am happy to finally watch a Vikram film from the theater and be satisfied. The screenplay was brilliant but there were a few compromises without which this could've been truly great.",

Suraj, on the other hand, looks completely different from his past roles, which is a nice surprise. The movie also features many Malayalam actors, which is interesting to see in a Tamil film.Vikram's physique is just amazing! He looks powerful, and his action scenes are fantastic. The second half of the movie starts with emotional moments, which is a good change. However, some of the emotions felt confusing, and I couldn't fully connect with them. The actress's acting felt too much in many scenes, making it hard to enjoy certain moments.Towards the climax, the movie starts to feel a bit slow and confusing. From the beginning, the film drops hints that make us think everything will be explained in the end. But by the time the movie finishes, some things are still unclear. This might be because the movie is in two parts, and we may get answers in the next one.Overall, Veera Soora Dhreeran is an intense action drama with strong performances.

        "title": "A Family Thriller with an Edge",
        "content": "Veera Dheera Sooran is a unique take on the thriller genre, with all the right ingredients to keep you on the edge of your seat. Though branded as an action thriller, it surprises by blending family drama with intense suspense. It's rare for a film to keep you hooked without relying on action in the first half, yet this one does just that, cleverly using restraint to build tension and make the eventual action feel earned.The film takes its time to establish the characters, the atmosphere, and the world they inhabit, and it does so wonderfully. Even without grand action sequences initially, Veera Dheera Sooran remains engrossing, with the first half maintaining a forward momentum that keeps you invested.Vikram is on fire, delivering one standout performance after another in recent years-Mahaan, PS1 and PS2, Thangalaan. In Veera Dheera Sooran, he adds incredible depth to a genre often dominated by spectacle. His performance grounds the film, and his chemistry with the effervescent Dushara brings an emotional authenticity to their relationship. Together, with the Mom character and the two kids, they create a powerful family dynamic that keeps you deeply invested in their journey, balancing both the tension and drama effortlessly.SJ Suryah adds yet another dimension to his acting repertoire. From Iravi and Jackie Pandian to his cunning portrayal of Arunagiri in VDS, his range is remarkable. Suraj Venjaramoodu delivers a fantastic Tamil debut, conveying so much through his eyes, while Prudhviraj's character arc adds a sinister, multi-layered complexity. Another standout performance is from Venkat, who holds his own brilliantly against Vikram in key scenes. Two moments in particular highlight his strength-first, the intense landmine (Kizhangu) sequence, and second, the gripping climax where Vikram confronts, chases, and ultimately kills him.The film's pacing and buildup are intricately woven through the relationships between these characters, especially the constant push and pull between loyalty, trust, and betrayal. From the lead to the supporting cast, every character has a well-developed arc that adds layers to the story.What stands out in Veera Dheera Sooran is how it subverts genre expectations. While it fits within the action-thriller mold, it doesn't rely on the usual mass tropes we often associate with such films. Instead, it's far more grounded and layered, blending family dynamics with crime and suspense in a thoughtful, nuanced way. The attention to detail is what makes it so rewarding, and the screenplay doesn't hold your hand-mysteries and small details unfold naturally, keeping you engaged in a way that few thrillers manage to do.SU Arun Kumar has truly redeemed himself since Chittha. With VDS, he has elevated his craft to the next level. He's one of the new-age directors who knows how to scale up from smaller films to larger ones while keeping the storytelling grounded and realistic.That said, the film's final payoff, while impactful, doesn't entirely deliver the emotional release that it seems to be building toward. It's like having a delicious full-course meal where the dessert, though tasty, doesn't quite live up to the expectations set by the main course. The buildup was compelling enough that the ending felt a little bit like it could have used a bit more punch. But that's a minor quibble in an otherwise well-executed movie.In conclusion, VDS is a film that deserves to be experienced in theatres. It's an ambitious and refreshing take on the thriller genre, one that skillfully mixes family drama with crime thriller elements, keeping you engaged throughout. Despite a slightly underwhelming payoff, the film has more than enough to offer in terms of performances, tension, and world-building. If you're looking for a movie that keeps you hooked from start to finish, this is a must-watch in theatres.",

There are few romantic scenes which is surely not a breaker but much needed for the movie\nit is all about survival when it comes to family and their existence.

        "content": "Chiyaan Vikram has been widely lauded for his nuanced portrayal of Kaali, showcasing a range of emotions and delivering a powerful performance. Critics note that the role suits his age and allows him to display his versatile acting skills...Vikram's stellar performance is a major highlight...S. J. Suryah also receives appreciation for bringing a fresh dimension to his role as a police officer. Dushara Vijayan makes a strong impact as well. Suraj Venjaramoodu, in his Tamil debut, also delivers a memorable performance...The film is described as a rural action thriller with elements of drama. Director S. U. Arun Kumar's writing and screenplay are acknowledged for building a complex narrative with well-defined characters. The first half is noted for its engaging, a bit slow-paced, setup of characters and their motivations. The second half is where the film reportedly picks up pace with well-executed action blocks. However, some reviews point out that the core storyline is simple and the pacing can be uneven, with the second half slowing down in certain portions...Arun Kumar's direction is appreciated for attempting to blend realistic elements with typical mass moments. Theni Eswar's cinematography is highlighted for capturing the gritty atmosphere and the rural backdrop effectively, utilizing shadows and lighting to enhance the mood. G. V. Prakash Kumar's background score is consistently praised for elevating the film's overall impact. The action choreography by 'Phoenix' Prabu is commended for being grounded and realistic...The film offers a gripping narrative, especially in the second half, with intense action sequences. The background score and cinematography contribute significantly to the film's atmosphere. The focus on choices and consequences within the storyline is also noted as a strong point...The film's pacing can be slow and uneven, particularly in the second half. The storyline, while intense, is considered by some to be wafer-thin and somewhat routine. S. J. Suryah's character is also noted as being underutilized...Mat be the pacing is delibertly slowed down to erupt the tension in the upcoming prequel...Overall: \"Veera Dheera Sooran\" is considered a decent action entertainer, primarily driven by Vikram's compelling performance and well-choreographed action sequences. While some pacing issues and a somewhat conventional storyline are noted, the film is likely to appeal to fans of action thrillers, especially those who appreciate Vikram's on-screen presence...",

Henry and Ray have such a unique dynamic together so this movie really missed the mark without captain man. There was too much going on as well and I feel they could have come up with a better plot than what they did. I didn't like Missys character I feel they could have focused more on the original cast members than bringing in this new character. Nothing about this movie felt like it was based on the series of Henry Danger everything was different. I even missed Henry and Pipers parents and of course it also isn't the same without Charlotte. I'm hoping there will be a sequel with Captain Man since the end teased 30 seconds of Captain Man asking for the help of kid danger. Overall the movie should have never been made without Ray. They also should have brought back some of the original sets to make it feel like I was watching a Henry Danger movie. Like Henry's house or the Man Cave. I watched the whole movie hoping for something that would catch my attention and the only part I got excited about was seeing Ray and Henry at the end. This movie just really missed the mark with me and I've been so excited to see it since it was announced.",

And I love how the story sort of leans on how Henry was made to learn how it was like \"being Jasper\" - the Unappreciated Sidekick, test and renew their friendship, it's superb. The makeup and the clothing/costumes? Amazing!. Unlike The Thundermans, which seemed geared toward a younger audience despite its older fan base, Henry Danger: The Movie feels like it matured alongside its viewers. It balances nostalgia with fresh, engaging content, making it enjoyable for longtime fans and new viewers alike. And the actors are all amazing, I liked piper as the Vampire and love Jasper's maturity (I did not really like his 'super power' thoüíÄ) and I'd have loved to see Charlotte in this. Honestly, I thought we wouldn't have a Captain Man's appearance, but him coming at the end to set up a sequel? Yesss.Overall, it's a fun, well-executed film that I highly recommend watching.",

The story has depth and emotion, the action sequences were well put together, the original character's chemistry was all still there, and they managed to make it funny.Spoilers Below!Pros:\nMy favorite part was seeing Jasper recognized as the good friend he has always been. He is more mature and not just the goofy friend anymore. Love that for his character. Henry has always had a big heart but everyone can lose their way sometimes and his character growth was very heart warming. I love they gave Henry a sidekick and the two were very funny together...it reminded me of Henry and Ray. Having a kid sidekick (and her character creating the plot) was really what made this a kids movie, everything else more mature...which was great. The comedy was there but not forced, they did a great job of keeping it in without it being stupid comedy. I laughed hard at a few parts. It felt a lot like the musical. They hated being in a musical and they hated being stuck in a kid's fan fiction stories. It was a great idea to create that story line. The last action sequence got a little intense which I wasn't expecting, but it was good. To top off an already good movie...they left it with a unexpected cliffhanger, which was awesome.Cons:\nOf course, we all missed Charlotte. Everyone always wanted to see Henry and Charlotte as a couple (especially since they are adults now), but that wouldn't have fit in this story. There was just too much already going on to go into depth with that too.Overall, this is a solid and entertaining movie for fans of the show.",

The series has been a staple of my childhood and it's good that it actually got a feature length film. The end of the original show has left plenty of room for Henry's story to continue and this definitely was the continuation we deserved. It focuses on Henry's journey now in Dystopia and getting entangled with a super fan. It does have some feel of the original but a little more serious. Seems to have matured with those who grew up with the original series (like I did). Thundermans Return had the feel of the original Thundermans series but doesn't feel like it matured with those who grew up with the original series. Henry Danger the Movie does seem to be emotionally tense at times and leaves you sitting at the edge of your seat, feeling like a couple two parter episodes of the original show. It does have some multiversal themes to it as we see a couple versions of the characters that aren't like what we've come to know. It does seem to tease a future installment. I like to see another film or two with more of the original cast of the original Henry Danger returning with everything we saw in this. This comeback does feel good!",

Well, I just finished watching the movie and it was just as bad as I expected it to be.Positives for Henry Danger: The Movie (2025):\nI can see fans of the show having some dumb fun with the movie. That's all I have to say for the positives.Negatives for Henry Danger: The Movie (2025):\nThe main plot of the movie is really dumb to where it felt like someone from Paramount was scrolling on the internet, found someone's dumb fanfiction and decided to convert it to a movie. The characters are just as stupid and nonsensical as they were in the show. The villains are laughably terrible where I could beat them with a single punch. The dialogue is cringe worthy and feels like a first draft. And finally, the movie ends on a note that teases a sequel or new tv show that will be just as stupid as this movie.Overall, Henry Danger: The Movie (2025) was clearly not made for me especially since I hate the original show and while I understand that it was made for kids, I've seen kids movies and tv shows that scan be for adults and kids.",

Not hating but not loving it either. I dont know much about the rest but i do know that they could do alittle better (not that i can write a whole movie up) it is better than the thundermans but this movie was just not living up to the hype.

The storyline of this film was fine enough and had enough direction all the way throughout this film. The cast selection was terrific. They deeply committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry that was really displayed throughout this entire film between the cast members could have been a bit better and stronger but it was alright enough. All of the cast members have improved a lot in their careers. Ella Anderson was fully spectacular as the antagonist. I was really impressed by her performance as a majestic electric vampire queen. Ella Anderson will go to far and great lengths in her career. I would gladly be turned into a vampire and be on her side. Frankie Grande gave a great performance as a vampire. If the crew do create more films or series, the universe should be extended. The crew could add the relationship between Henry and Babe from Game Shakers and she can become Danger Babe, or have Frankini meet up and work with Goomer and his sister Cat from Victorious and the spinoff series, or have everyone from all the series working together. It could be a multiple crossovers in one. There is still a chance that the original Henry Danger team and Danger Force could work together.",

        "content": "The Henry Danger movie is definitely a 10/10, and here's why. As someone who watched the show, the movie brought back everything fans loved but made it even bigger and better. It had action, comedy, and emotional moments that made it fun for everyone, whether you were a fan of the show or not. First of all, the movie stayed true to the show while also giving us something new. The show was always funny, exciting, and full of great characters, and the movie gave us even more of that. Captain Man and Kid Danger were as amazing as ever. Their jokes and teamwork were so fun to watch, and their bond felt stronger than ever. It reminded fans why they loved these characters so much, but it also showed them growing and facing bigger challenges. It felt like we were seeing a new side of them, which made it special. The story of the movie was another reason it was so great. It didn't feel like just a longer version of an episode-it felt like a real adventure. The stakes were higher, the danger was bigger, and the villain was actually really interesting. The action scenes were exciting, but there were also some twists that kept things surprising. The movie also had emotional moments that made you care about the characters even more. The pacing was just right, so there was never a boring moment, and it kept you hooked the whole time. One of the best things about the movie was how it worked for everyone. Fans of the show got to see their favorite characters and fun Easter eggs, but new viewers could enjoy it too because the story stood on its own. It was the perfect mix of old and new, which is really hard to do, but they nailed it. In the end, the Henry Danger movie was everything fans could've wanted. It was funny, action-packed, and even emotional at times. It showed how much effort was put into making something that would make fans happy, and it's a movie that will stick with them for a long time. It's easy to see why so many people loved it-because it was just that good.",

The idea should've been around Dystopia and not introducing a new place. Should've introduced Dystopian villains instead of made up ones from a 'story'. Decent character developments. Should've also included other places which could've introduced captain man and charlotte to join, instead of 4 random places with barely any or the same characters. Captain man teaser was short, maybe hinting for another movie, hopefully. The movie could be centered around Dystopia more though, if Henry was going to leave the place at the end.",

        "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* It was pretty cool to see Henry grown up fighting crime where we left off with him. I thought the main plot point of Jasper living in Henry's shadow was interesting, but I feel like it doesn't work. Henry spent years in Captain Man's shadow and we saw how it got to Henry sometimes, so I feel that he should understand Jasper's frustration being in his shadow and not getting enough credit better since he was once there. Just seems a bit out of character for Henry. As for his adventure with Missy, it was entertaining. I feel like there were better directions to take this movie, for example the conflict between Henry and Jasper could've been something they worked through as they fought Blackout throughout the movie, not just at the beginning and end. Blackout was much more intriguing than the other villains. Missy's character wasn't unlikable, but not very interesting. Jumping from different worlds wasn't as fun as you think it would be. It was cool to see Henry see different versions of Jasper and realize that they're always there for him no matter what world, but the rest of it wasn't too interesting. I guess they are supposed to be 2D villains, but the vampire Piper and coach villains were lame. And Frankini felt very shoehorned into the movie. He was in it for an uncomfortable amount and his presence outside of his own weird club felt very unnatural. His musical number went on for too long as well, it wasn't good regardless. I feels like Nick is continuing to push their gay character down our throats to convince us they're inclusive. There wasn't too much action, but Jasper kicking butt and holding his own against the vampires and coach was cool to see, which was the most action we saw. It felt like the movie purposely avoided mild violence, which the show never strayed from. Like Henry is a trained fighter, he shouldn't have an issue holding his own instead of hesitating against a mean version of his sister. The two things that made me fall in love with the original show was the action and humor. This movie doesn't have much action, and I can't recall a single instance when I smirk or scoffed because the humor is nonexistent. Henry Danger is a light-hearted show. I get Henry is older, but without any humor this movie feels very foreign compared to even Danger Force. Anyways the best parts of the movie were the five minutes at the end and beginning. The main part of the movie struggled to keep me invested. It was cool to see Henry and the other legacy characters, but they weren't as interesting as in the show. I wish they would've left the Henry Danger show as it is, this movie isn't necessary and doesn't add much to where we left off. It looks like another movie or show is coming, which is disappointing. In the end Jasper did get credit from Henry, which was cool, but again it felt like the tension between them was out of character for both of them. But I will admit I did smirk at the end when Captain Man appeared. Overall this movie isn't unwatchable, just boring. It didn't go in with high expectations anyways. There was better ways to go about this movie.",

        "content": "I'm only providing spoilers for a certain cameo at the end. The rest of the review will remain as spoiler-free as possible.If \"Danger Force\" wasn't the first IMDb review I've ever done, I would've skipped this made-for-TV and streaming film. After seeing it, I wish I didn't watch it altogether. The fact that this is the first 2025 movie I'm seeing makes it hurt worse.Though Dan Schnieder is a degenerate who should be in jail by now, he unfortunately was vital in most people's childhoods through shows like \"Henry Danger.\" I used to love that show, but its spinoff, \"Danger Force,\" was so awful that it made me lose complete faith in both the \"Henry Danger\" franchise and Nickelodeon. I haven't even watched SpongeBob for four years. However, curiosity led to me seeing this film. Do I regret seeing it? Yes, but it's worth writing a review about.Let's start with the positives. Jace Norman remains likable as Henry Hart, while the rest of the actors did skillfully as their respective characters.I found the very brief action to be solid. I understand it's TV-PG and made for kids, which is the target demographic of \"Henry Danger,\" but considering they wanted to make a film and the IMDb plot synopsis describes this as a theatrical movie at the time of writing, I expected more action. I'll still give the action credit as a positive, as minimal as it may be.I also thought there were two scenes, the Syrup Wars story and the ending, where Christopher Charles Kempinski's cinematography was stellar. The rest of the cinematography was unmemorable and generic, but again, I'm discussing the positives.Finally, a cameo at the end made me happy, but it played into the negatives.Screw it; let's get into why this film is trash! First, the narrative is woefully dumb. It amounts to a Kid Danger fan bringing Henry into a multiverse of fan fiction to fight crime alongside her. In a world where multiverse stories are either universally unwanted or starting to become less interesting, \"Henry Danger: The Movie\" does nothing new. Most of the universes feature the same antagonists - intentionally so, I know - so it's only the settings they're in that are changing. It eventually becomes a rinse-and-repeat formula that doesn't make sense. They enter different worlds, yet I believe that the vampire version of Piper remains the same. I'm struggling to find ways to describe how stupid the plot is. I'll guarantee you'll see how truly absurd this film is once you see it. Depending on who you are, don't.Outside of one joke, the humor is child's play. I know this is for children, but if you're making a movie based on a show I liked, I'll watch it. Most of the jokes feel juvenile and feel as if they lack that \"Henry Danger\" writing. I'm not asking Dan Schnieder to make this thing because he shouldn't be allowed back in Hollywood, let alone work with kids. It's a noticeable difference, but if Schnieder was responsible for the show's humor, keep the film's jokes as they are. There's more that makes this movie wrong to talk about that doesn't revolve around its differences compared to the show, but man, they're just some dumb lines that I want you to hear:\"Help, I'm being crimed!\"\"Care to join Bite Club? It's to die for!\"\"Ironically, I'm about to black out.\"Have you ever wanted to hear no less than five dad-vibe mustache jokes that make zero sense? If you answered no, too bad, because they're in here!I felt the absence of Cooper Barnes' Captain Man. He only shows up at the end as a cameo appearance. Captain Man being a central character would've made this movie feel more worthy of the \"Henry Danger\" name. As is, it feels like a desperate setup for another film. I guess I'll watch it when it comes out, but it reeks of missed potential, and that's what this film is. It's a movie that caters exclusively to kids, rarely matures with its 2010s audience, and has no lasting impact on the franchise outside of its ending sequence. It's a side quest with characters who don't deserve to be present in said adventure.That's perhaps a sad thing about growing up. Things you may have loved as a kid have aged for the worse, and you can't help but see nothing but negatives from it. I bet if I watched \"Henry Danger\" today, its humor would have aged, and that's without the dark Schnieder context. Knowing he was involved with a project will make it worse, so that's more reason not to rewatch it.Overall, I didn't enjoy \"Henry Danger: The Movie.\" It may work for you, but this was a poor choice for my first 2025 film. I may check out its potential sequel, but it reminds me why I stopped watching Nickelodeon. This stuff isn't for me anymore, and that's okay, but I have to judge this as a film.Technically, it's okay. There's nothing objectively wrong with the film, only this time, it seems to have a much larger budget than the TV projects that came before it. The acting, the directing, and (some) perfect cinematography make for a 5/10 technical score.For the enjoyment score, 3/10. Once more, this franchise is no longer for me. You may have a different enjoyment score, and that's okay. However, I felt I would've gained nothing from this experience if I didn't write a review. If you stopped watching Nickelodeon half a decade ago, you likely won't have a good time. Otherwise, the chances of you having an entertaining time are higher!I hope that Jace Norman finds work outside of Nickelodeon. He's an actor who I feel has the potential to do more with his talents. I grew up watching his show and many of the Nickelodeon movies he made, such as \"Splitting Adam,\" \"Rufus,\" \"Rufus 2,\" \"Blurt,\" and \"Bixler High Private Eye.\" Norman's acting credits are almost nothing but programs related to Nickelodeon. If he loves working for the network and wants to continue, I respect his decision. I'm only saying if A24 or Neon were to cast him in one of their projects, it'd be the perfect opportunity for Norman to become more than what he became popular for. I know I may have done almost nothing but tear apart this movie, but it's important to note that none of the negatives are the fault of any of the actors. Norman, if you're reading this, thank you for making my childhood. I hope you continue doing great things; you'll always be one of my childhood heroes.",

I hate that he didn't have his powers in alternative universes, also i think that tjis movie should contain jesper getting real super powers, and becoming henry's equal so they beat a villain stronger than them individualy..A major plot hole is that they allready defeated blackout in danger force. They could just name him anything else. To avoid this problem.I know that henry's shield is basicly unbeatable but they need to make him use the force field in cooler and more creative ways (for an example cover his fists with force fied for strong knockback punches). I know that nickelodeon is limited when it comes to cgi and can't rely on it. They did a good job with piper but they should do some cgi on henry's shields. It's such a cool power but is under used and under developed.I know this isn't phase 1-3 marvel but still i want powers showcase. They did great with his speed powers in OG series. They wrote themselves into a corner and made henry's powers unbeatable by henry danger villains, that's why they allways nerf him so th story can progress. If next movie comes i want the villain to overpover or be equal to henry when he is using his powers to their maximum potential.In reality i give this movie a 6/10.",

With Thundermans Return, it more or less is the sequel to the series revisiting the universe of the original show. With Teen Wolf, it felt similar to the Henry Danger Movie. While it did explore what key characters were doing and expanding on the original show (and continuing the continuity they had at the end) it wasn't the movie the fans would have wanted since it continued a plot line already dealt with.While this isn't the same as that, it was a good mix between the two. It continued the continuity but also expanded the universe/characters without having to revist Swellview locations or bringing back all the familiar characters from the original show. There are some reviews that say \"it wasn't based on the original series\" or \"they needed Captain Man in it\" but not having both of those made it better. For one, at the end of Danger Force, Captain Man retired so the 30 second cameo we got at the end will be well explored in a (hopeful) sequel since it will be interesting to see what would cause him to come out of said retirement. Also, we already knew what happened to Henry during Danger Force so it was interesting to see that side of it explored a bit more.Another review mentioned about Henry not recognizing that Jasper was living in the shadow, but it also made sense since even though he himself was a sidekick, he never felt like he was in a shadow, just that he didn't live his own life.Overall, the movie had hits and misses and I only wish that they explored how Missy was able to figure out the identies a bit more.",

It felt like the perfect way to wrap up the Henry Danger universe in a big way! Go team!",

        "content": "I saw a lot of people saying that the movie is bad or that the movie is for children, and these same people forget that the series itself is for a young audience. The film itself was wonderful YES, people in Brazil will receive it well since that is where there are the most fans of the series and I speak with authority because I lived there in my adolescence and I guarantee that other countries that know it will too. I just think they could have brought more of Captain Man, but getting out of context and away from the same thing in the series was an incredible idea. Really. It would be a very boring movie if it only stayed the same, Captain and Kid Danger fighting with the same villains. What intrigued me was that Charlotte didn't appear in the movie, it could have been a surprise like Captain Man appearing at the end. In short, the series is wonderful, the movie was wonderful, I loved the cast, I loved the new character, and I loved your fanfics. I hope you can watch the movie and realize that it's a teenage thing, teenagers love these things. Unfortunately, we've grown up and we don't see it the same way we did when we were 13 or 14 years old, people! It's a fictional story that tells the story of superheroes. Do you want everything to be like real life? Of course not, right? I hope that in the future you can watch the movie without looking for flaws and then come to the site to comment. Kisses.",

The show's blend of action, humor, and heart really resonated with me. I remember watching episodes every day after school, eagerly anticipating what would happen next with Henry and his friends.The way the show tackled themes like friendship, family, and personal growth was incredibly authentic and relatable. I identified so much with the characters and their struggles that it felt like I was living alongside them.The movie was a great conclusion to the series and left me feeling nostalgic. It's amazing how a TV show can evoke such strong nostalgia and emotions! I highly recommend the Henry Danger movie to anyone who grew up watching the series or to those looking for an inspiring and exciting story.",

Well that's all that really preoccupied me as this otherwise unremarkable and messy teen drama took us on its own version of colourful time travel. That's because the hero manages to lose his powers to his malevolent sister (Ella Anderson) thanks to the enthusiastic interference of new fan \"Missy\" (Glee Dango) and to his fed up cohort \"Jasper\" (Sean Ryan Fox) who is fed up doing all the work whilst his handsome buddy takes all the glory. Well in this alternative world, it's \"Jasper\" who kicks ass and it means that \"Henry\" is going to have to eat loads of humble pie if he is to convince his \"new\" friends to help him go back to the old days! Personally, I think I'd have told him to take an hike but this is Nickelodeon remember so even the nasties are fairly nice as all that is missing is a custard pie fight. Indeed, it only narrowly avoids becoming an human version of a \"Ninja Turtles\" movie. I'm not the demographic, so I'm not really the man to say - but I suspect this is only for die-hard fans of the television series and/or the all-American Norman.",

The judge declaring a verdict based on a post without verification is ridiculous. I know it's fiction but the scene could have been planned in a more believable manner. The movie should have ended with the death of Pakhi. Additionally, it would have been more impactful if her last word of Pakhi was 'Baba'.If you have watched it and found it decently likable then please spread the word and encourage all to watch.

        "title": "Jongli Review: Siam Ahmed's Most Transformative Role Yet",
        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of Bangladeshi cinema, Jongli (2025) emerges as a bold and visceral film that breaks away from conventional formulas. Released during Eid-ul-Fitr, the movie showcases a gritty, emotionally charged narrative led by Siam Ahmed in one of his most transformative performances to date. Directed by M Raahim, Jongli dives deep into primal human instincts, exploring survival, alienation, and redemption with a level of intensity rarely seen in mainstream Dhallywood productions.At the heart of Jongli is the story of a man disconnected from society and tormented by the scars of his past. Though the film doesn't rely on a highly structured or traditional plotline, it focuses instead on the emotional and psychological journey of its central character. Siam Ahmed plays a man wrestling with his identity, purpose, and relationships, particularly those tied to his broken family and a world that never quite accepted him. The narrative is raw, unfolding in a grim and often unforgiving setting that mirrors the protagonist's internal struggles.Siam Ahmed delivers a powerhouse performance that is both physically and emotionally taxing. Known for his charming boy-next-door persona in earlier roles, Ahmed completely shatters that image in Jongli. He committed himself to the character long before the cameras rolled, spending over six months in preparation. This included a dramatic physical transformation-growing out his hair and beard, toning down his physique, and embracing a more rugged appearance. But more impressive than the physical change is the emotional depth he brings to the role. He portrays his character's pain, rage, and isolation with subtlety and conviction, making every expression and silence speak volumes. It's a haunting performance that lingers with the viewer long after the film ends.Director M Raahim deserves credit for constructing a cinematic experience that is both atmospheric and grounded. His approach to storytelling prioritizes emotional authenticity over spectacle. The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing scenes to breathe and emotions to simmer. The cinematography is stark and evocative, using a muted color palette and natural lighting to emphasize the bleakness of the protagonist's world. Every frame feels intentional, from wide shots of desolate landscapes to intimate close-ups that capture the slightest shifts in expression. Raahim doesn't shy away from discomfort-in fact, he leans into it, forcing the audience to confront the same harsh realities the characters face.One of the film's strengths lies in its supporting performances, particularly from Shobnom Bubly. As the female lead, she brings warmth and complexity to a role that could have easily been one-dimensional. Her character serves not as a romantic interest in the traditional sense, but as a mirror to the protagonist's fractured humanity. Their chemistry on screen is understated but emotionally charged, and their interactions add depth to the broader themes of trust, forgiveness, and reconnection. The supporting cast is strong across the board, grounding the film in realism and reinforcing the weight of the protagonist's journey.The music and sound design in Jongli play an essential role in building the film's atmosphere. Rather than dominating the scenes, the soundtrack subtly underscores emotional beats, enhancing the audience's immersion. Ambient sounds, such as the rustle of trees or distant calls in the wilderness, are used to great effect, creating a soundscape that feels organic and intense. One of the standout musical moments is the song \"Ami To Jongli,\" which encapsulates the core of the character's internal chaos while also serving as a thematic anchor.Audience reception to Jongli has been overwhelmingly positive. Viewers have praised the film not only for its cinematic quality but also for its emotional resonance. Many have commented on how the themes of father-son relationships, estrangement, and mental health touched a chord, particularly in a cultural context where such topics are often avoided. The film's release was met with sold-out shows and extended screenings, as word of mouth helped it build a loyal and emotionally invested audience. Siam Ahmed himself noted in interviews that the film \"didn't just find an audience, it built one,\" underscoring the impact Jongli had on viewers willing to engage with more challenging narratives.Ultimately, Jongli is more than just a film-it's a cinematic experience that dares to be different. It strips away the gloss and glamour often associated with Eid releases, opting instead for a raw, introspective tale about the parts of ourselves we often try to hide. Siam Ahmed's commitment to his role, coupled with M Raahim's vision and a solid ensemble cast, results in a film that is deeply affecting, visually arresting, and narratively daring. It sets a new benchmark for character-driven storytelling in Bangladeshi cinema and proves that the industry is capable of producing work that is both artistically ambitious and emotionally truthful. For audiences looking for substance, Jongli is not to be missed.",

The story is good but presented in a way that would cringe any typical movie buffs. I felt uncomfortable so many times with the cringe dialogues and weirdly paced storytelling and songs in every 15/20 minutes. The last 20/30 minutes is good. I think this is why the movie is being praised so much because it has an emotional ending. But other than that, despite having a good story, i did not like this movie at all.Alright enough with the bad things. The acting was really good. Specially siam and the child actress did really great in their roles. The story is good. The songs are good but too many to remember. Could be better to use less songs.",

The villains were also comical, no extra was put in to them from any random Bollywood villains.Even the story, which I thought had a good start, turned into a joke. Am I supposed to believe that after 52 crores bank accounts being emptied, the villains were so damn easy to locate? And yet the only person running after them was our dear Fateh?

        "content": "Jacqueline Fernandez and Sonu Sood's latest collaboration is an unfortunate misstep, plagued by weak performances and poor direction. At its core, the film attempts to weave a story of love, redemption, and sacrifice. However, the lack of chemistry between the leads and an unconvincing execution prevents the story from resonating.Jacqueline plays a woman caught between her tragic past and an uncertain future, but her performance does little to bring this emotional journey to life. Her portrayal feels flat, with minimal effort to convey the depth of her character's struggles. This isn't surprising, as Jacqueline's acting has consistently been limited, lacking the ability to immerse audiences in her roles. This film is no exception-her inability to evoke genuine emotion weakens pivotal scenes.Sonu Sood, who also directs, plays a heroic figure determined to help her overcome her challenges. His character has moments that could have been compelling, but his performance is overly theatrical at times and devoid of nuance. As a director, his inexperience is evident. The film suffers from uneven pacing, clunky transitions, and poorly choreographed action sequences that feel more like filler than meaningful additions to the plot.The story, which had the potential to explore themes of healing and hope, ends up feeling superficial. The screenplay fails to dig deep into the characters' motivations or relationships, leaving the audience disconnected from their journey. The climax, meant to be emotional and uplifting, feels rushed and hollow due to the lack of buildup.In the end, this film highlights Jacqueline's consistent shortcomings as an actor and Sonu's growing pains as a director. Both need to reconsider their approach to projects like this. Stronger storytelling, better character development, and more authentic performances could have saved this film from being so forgettable. Overall, this film fails to leave a lasting impression, weighed down by Jacqueline Fernandez's lackluster acting and Sonu Sood's uneven direction. While it might hold some appeal for Bollywood audiences accustomed to melodramatic storytelling, even within that context, it falls short of delivering anything memorable. On an international level, the film barely scrapes by with a 3/10, reflecting its weak performances, clich√©d plot, and amateur execution. For Bollywood standards, it might merit a slightly more generous 5/10, as it aligns with some of the industry's formulaic offerings. However, it ultimately lacks the substance and finesse to stand out in either context.",

For instance, when Fateh was getting details on Nimrit's disappearance, that point could have been more detailed & made the story more intense.Secondly, a villain is the heart of Indian films. That should have been introduced in a more intensive & thrilling way.Yet, in some points, some dialogue deliveries were mind-blowing.Last but not least, after watching the ending point, I am assuming that there will be a part 2 of this movie, although it hasn't been announced.

The idea of fake loan apps and digital scams is very relevant today, and I thought it could lead to an engaging and thought-provoking story. The first half seemed promising-action was well-paced, and the storyline had a good setup, and I was genuinely invested in seeing where it would go.But then the second half completely lost me. The film quickly devolves into nothing more than a series of mindless gunfights, to the point where it felt like I was watching someone play a third-person shooter video game. It was eventually clear that the filmmakers were heavily inspired by the action sequences in Animal, but unlike that film, Fateh failed to make those scenes anything more than repetitive and tiring.The forced attempts at comedy during action scenes didn't land at all. In fact, they felt out of place and just awkward. As for the performances, Jacqueline Fernandez struggled to even deliver her lines correctly, with half of them sounding as mumbles. On the other hand, Naseeruddin Shah, was sadly underutilized and didn't get much to work with. Vijay Raaz, too, was just doing the same old stuff we've seen from him in previous films-no new ground broken here.Overall, Fateh starts off with a solid premise and some decent buildup, but it completely fizzles out in the second half. The action and forced humor couldn't save it. If you're looking for something fresh or even just well-executed, this one's pretty much avoidable.",

Probably for the first time in last 1 decade or so, this is a movie which you can watch without having to suffer thru mind-numbing mediocracy or feel like fast forwarding scene after scene.Caution - if u r fan of pushpa 2, jawan, kgf, 2042 or something, this-that kind of movies, then u will most likely find this one kind of boring.. u will probably ask what is special about it? U will not feel like whisling. Nothing special probably from \"cinema\" perspective but a genuine, crisp, original (with some fight sequences inspired may be from kill bill and so) action movie made in Indian language, which is very very rare case.Dialogues in most parts and script are tight. Story could have been improved avoiding few lapses here and there, the movie had the potential to be in Indian Bourne league.Showcases great potential of Sonu Sood as director and will wait for a more polished next project of his.",

The cast includes notable actors like Jacqueline Fernandez, Vijay Raaz, Naseeruddin Shah, and Dibyendu Bhattacharya. The story follows a former secret agent who, after leaving a covert agency that operates without any identification or records, settles into a quiet life running a dairy farm in a village. However, he soon finds himself drawn back into the dangerous world of cybercrime, where he takes on a powerful cyber mafia. The film features intense action sequences, including a breathtaking opening fight and a gripping climax, all set against a backdrop of real locations. With a compelling narrative that highlights the issues of online fraud and cybercrime, the film delivers a strong message without any romantic or comedic elements. I particularly enjoyed the character of Fateh, portrayed by Sonu Sood, who exhibits OCD, adding depth to his persona. The fight scenes are expertly choreographed, making it one of the standout action thrillers in Indian cinema. The movie carries vibes reminiscent of both John Wick and James Bond. Overall, Fateh is a must-watch, showcasing Sonu Sood's impressive directorial skills. While I believe he should continue to create more films like this, a sequel may not be necessary.",

However, while the film's intentions are noble, its execution falls short of leaving a lasting impression. Fateh is a sincere effort from Sonu Sood that highlights a relevant social issue while delivering action-packed entertainment. While it doesn't break new ground in the genre, it remains a decent watch for action enthusiasts and fans of Sonu Sood. With tighter scripting and more nuanced character development, it could have been a much stronger cinematic experience.The storytelling suffers from uneven pacing and underdeveloped characters, preventing it from reaching its full potential. Despite these flaws, Sonu Sood, both as director and lead actor, gives a commendable performance. His action sequences are intense and engaging. Jacqueline Fernandez given a decent performance. Vijay Raaz steps into a different character space and performs admirably. Naseeruddin Shah in minimal screen time delivers a good performance. Dibyendu Bhattacharya, Shiv Jyoti Rajput, Soundous Moufakir, and others were fine in their roles.The screenplay, penned by Sonu Sood and Ankur Pajni, is fast-paced and engaging, though it falters with some ordinary dialogues. The action sequences, on the other hand, are well-executed, supported by an effective background score that heightens the tension. Unfortunately, the songs fails to leave a mark and does little to elevate the film's mood. Clocking in at 140 minutes, Fateh manages to avoid monotony but also doesn't offer any truly memorable moments.Direction 2.5/5\nActing 3/5\nDialogues 2.5/5\nStory 2/5\nScreenplay 2.5/5.",

The story is engaging and has been written thoughtfully, blending elements of action, drama, and subtle emotional undertones.Sonu Sood, stepping into the shoes of a lone vigilante, delivers a commendable performance. He perfectly captures the essence of a one-man army-a hero who stands tall against injustice. His portrayal is convincing, intense, and, at times, heartfelt. He brings his own charm and gravitas to the character, making it relatable to Indian audiences while maintaining the spirit of the original inspiration.However, I found myself wishing for a slightly faster-paced storyline. While the narrative is well-crafted, it could have benefitted from a tighter screenplay, especially in the first half. A bit more adrenaline-pumping action sequences, similar to those seen in the Equalizer series, would have elevated the experience. Given that the protagonist is set up as a larger-than-life action hero, the audience naturally expects high-octane action scenes, and while there are moments that deliver, they are somewhat sparse.The supporting cast does a decent job, but the focus firmly remains on Sonu Sood, and rightly so. The direction ensures the film's tone remains consistent, with a mix of suspense and grit, but a few scenes felt predictable. Despite this, the film keeps you hooked with its emotional core and moral dilemmas, something Indian cinema often excels at.One of the standout aspects is how the movie manages to weave in an Indian cultural essence, making it more than just a direct remake. The themes of community, family, and justice are deeply rooted in the Indian context, giving the film a distinct identity. This adaptation respects the source material while making it relevant to a new audience.The cinematography and background score deserve a special mention. They enhance the tension and atmosphere, adding weight to the protagonist's journey. The action choreography, while effective, could have been a bit more stylized to leave a lasting impact.The ending leaves room for a sequel, and I, for one, am eagerly anticipating the next chapter. With three installments in the Equalizer franchise, this Indian remake certainly has the potential to explore more. If a sequel is on the cards, I hope the makers will bring in more gripping action sequences and a slightly faster narrative pace to satisfy the audience's expectations.In conclusion, this film is a solid attempt at reimagining The Equalizer with an Indian twist.

The opening scene and sequence was strong enough to tell how's the movie going to be, but somewhere I felt acting was a bit weak after that sequence and in between intermission. Now for the action lowers, this movie best which bollywood has released recently. Talking about Casting, it was great for every role in my oppinion. The overall message given in this movie making everyone aware about cyber crimes going on recently is a great thing, also without any kind of unnecessary songs and teasing nudity or adult scenes, movie keeps us hooked till the end. The one thing I'll say is Background score could have been better while fight scenes.",

The film incorporates many elements reminiscent of movies like Equalizer and Animal. While the action choreography stands out, the blood CGI is noticeably poor. The camerawork is good, but the editing turns out to be bad. The songs are decent, and although the background score is good, it seems to be misplaced in many scenes, failing to elevate the intended moments. The film tries hard to be a \"cool\" and invincible spectacle where a man goes on a killing spree, but it ends up feeling very wannabe.Sonu Sood gives his all to the role and looks convincing in the action sequences. Jacqueline's character and subplot feel very clich√©. Naseeruddin Shah is wasted, while Vijay Raaz steals the show with his stellar dialogue delivery, standing out as the most memorable part of the film. The rest of the supporting cast is just average.

The idea of fake loan apps and digital scams is very relevant today, and I thought it could lead to an engaging and thought-provoking story. The first half seemed promising-action was well-paced, and the storyline had a good setup, and I was genuinely invested in seeing where it would go.But then the second half completely lost me. The film quickly devolves into nothing more than a series of mindless gunfights, to the point where it felt like I was watching someone play a third-person shooter video game. It was eventually clear that the filmmakers were heavily inspired by the action sequences in Animal, but unlike that film, Fateh failed to make those scenes anything more than repetitive and tiring.The forced attempts at comedy during action scenes didn't land at all. In fact, they felt out of place and just awkward. As for the performances, Jacqueline Fernandez struggled to even deliver her lines correctly, with half of them sounding as mumbles. On the other hand, Naseeruddin Shah, was sadly underutilized and didn't get much to work with. Vijay Raaz, too, was just doing the same old stuff we've seen from him in previous films-no new ground broken here.Overall, Fateh starts off with a solid premise and some decent buildup, but it completely fizzles out in the second half. The action and forced humor couldn't save it. If you're looking for something fresh or even just well-executed, this one's pretty much avoidable.",

The theatre scene was exact copy of movie The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington when he goes to a pub run by Russians to save Chloe Grace. If you haven't watched that movie, go watch it and its action scenes.2. The action artists whom Fateh ram every now and then felt useless and unrealistic. Like he kills 100s of them in one scene, but none comes forward in a group to kill him.3. Fateh could fly a knife and kill his opponent, but all the opponents were dumb and dumber and never do the same on him.4. When Fateh doesn't have guns, opponents also doesn't. In one scene the opponent had, and Fateh was able to steal it from him without much effort. Really.People who are comparing its action sequences with John Wick are forgetting that in John Wick, it's his suit that soaks all the gun shots. And as and when John fights forward, he gets equally exhausted and shows pain. In Fateh, Sonu Sood plays God mode and nothing less.Now I am not against this movie or Sonu Sood, and i really appreciated his direction.

This is true that much was at stake on this Movie; the so-called first charismatic cinematic presentation in 2025. But it has failed to impact and there are several factors behind this.This is true that crime has emerged as the most dominating theme in the Celluloid world during the last few years. The Movie Fateh also narrates a crime story. It narrates the story of Cyber crime and related affairs. This issue is burning one in today's context. This proves that the Movie had ample opportunity to make experiment. Nevertheless, this Movie doesn't look Impressive. The main reason behind this is the Movie fails to prove purpose and relevance. The action keeps fluctuating too frequently which distracts attention. The Movie seems to cover the whole world of Cyber Crime and the reality is obvious. There are some melodramatic sequences which make the Movie more monotonous.Poor characterization is another weak point of the Movie. It is really hard to find relevance of some of the characters in the Movie. Similarly, acting is not up to the mark in this Movie. Sonu Sood seems lacking acting depth despite his reputation. Even actor like Nasiruddin Shah also seems stereotypical. What can be more unfortunate?The remaining damage has been done by the Playback Singers. The composition and song sequences are of poor quality. The singing style and rendering again prove why the concept of Playback Singing no longer exists in Bollywood.Overall, impression is not encouraging as far as the Movie Fateh is concerned.

Thankfully, the film isn't selling itself on the strength of its story, as the focus is clearly on its brutal R-rated action. It's a good thing that the action delivers, although it too suffers from some minor issues like excessive use of shaky cam, firing limitless amount of bullets from a single gun, villains conveniently not having guns or not choosing to shoot from long distance when hero is unarmed etc. For a first timer director, Sonu Sood does an admiring job, and he excels physically too in the lead role as the mysterious assassin. While watching this film, I got reminded of BEEKEEPER. The best thing that I liked about this film is that right from the beginning, there were no dull moments, and even though the film turned farfetched in many parts, it remained engaging throughout.If the story was given a little more care, this could have turned into something really great. Alas! It wasn't meant to be.A big shoutout to Vijay Raaz, the man totally chewed the scenery whenever he was on the screen. Although I was very disappointed by Naseer Sahab; not sure what went wrong, but he wasn't even a tiny bit menacing as the main antagonist. Jacqueline is meh (as always), and the decision to make his relationship with Fateh as a romantic one was clearly a mistake.Overall, FATEH is a decent film that works due to its admirable idea and good action, although it would have worked even better had the screenplay been not so basic and improbable, and the core idea not so oversimplified.",

        "content": "Review of FatehFateh is a film that arrives with considerable hype, but it quickly becomes apparent that it fails to deliver on almost every front. While its IMDb rating might suggest a decent or even exceptional experience, a closer look at the reviews reveals a pattern of suspiciously glowing feedback. The reality of watching the film, however, is a far cry from the ratings, leaving one to wonder if they are the result of an orchestrated effort to inflate its perceived quality.At its core, Fateh is a film without identity or direction. The plot is lackluster and uninspired, failing to grab the viewer's attention or provide any real stakes. Whatever premise the filmmakers were aiming for is poorly executed, with the story feeling more like an extended advertisement than a coherent narrative. It lacks depth, originality, and emotional resonance, leaving the audience disengaged throughout its runtime.The characters fare no better. From the protagonist to the supporting cast, no one stands out as memorable or compelling. The performances across the board are mediocre at best, with even the lead actor struggling to inject life into a script that offers no room for development or intrigue. Dialogues are stale and clich√©d, making it impossible to invest in the characters or their journey. Instead of portraying relatable or interesting figures, the film delivers flat caricatures that fail to evoke any empathy or interest.One of the most glaring issues with Fateh is how blatantly commercial it feels. Rather than focusing on crafting a meaningful story, the film constantly bombards the audience with product placements and promotional undertones. It's as if the filmmakers were more interested in turning the movie into a marketing tool than providing an entertaining experience. This overemphasis on commercial elements not only undermines the narrative but also alienates the audience, who are left feeling as though they've paid to watch a long advertisement.Visually, the film is equally disappointing. The cinematography is unremarkable, offering nothing that elevates the storytelling or adds to the viewing experience. Action sequences, which could have been a redeeming factor, are poorly choreographed and unimaginative. There is no sense of excitement or thrill in these scenes, which feel more like obligations than genuine attempts to engage the audience. Even the production design, which could have added some visual appeal, is generic and forgettable.The soundtrack, a vital component of any engaging film, is another area where Fateh falls short. The music is uninspiring, with songs that feel like they've been added as an afterthought rather than integral parts of the story. None of the tracks leave a lasting impression, and they fail to enhance the emotional or narrative beats of the film.The pacing is perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of Fateh. At just over two hours, the film feels unnecessarily long, dragging from one uninspired scene to the next. There is no sense of urgency or momentum, with scenes lingering far longer than they should. This lack of tight editing and direction only adds to the overall sense of boredom and frustration.Another major issue with Fateh is its lack of clarity about its audience. The film tries to cater to multiple demographics but fails to resonate with any. It lacks a clear vision or purpose, resulting in a disjointed and incoherent experience. Instead of focusing on a single theme or genre, the film meanders aimlessly, leaving viewers confused and disengaged.In conclusion, Fateh is a movie that falls short in nearly every department. Its plot is uninspired, its characters are forgettable, and its execution is riddled with commercialism and lack of creativity.

That is what hooked me into the story. Then his junior joins the team and the relationship between them makes the premise even stronger as they share the same dream, the dream that Hibino had given up on.When Hibino becomes a kaiju himself (by questionable means) things get even more interesting.But the thing that surprised me most about this film is that it's very funny. I wasn't expecting it and it was a great surprise to have all the jokes peppered in, without taking away from the emotional arcs of the characters.And the characters do have arcs! At least Hibino does and he's the most interesting character, even Mina undergoes a bit of change in the last act.I hope this film gets seen and I'm looking forward to seeing the next instalment in the franchise.",

        "content": "In a cinematic landscape often dominated by tired tropes and predictable punchlines, Dhoom Dhaam emerges as a delightful surprise, a refreshing dose of genuine humor that leaves you in stitches while also offering moments of heartwarming connection. This isn't your run-of-the-mill comedy; it's a film that dares to be quirky, to embrace the absurd, and to deliver jokes that you haven't heard a million times before.At the heart of this comedic gem lies the undeniable chemistry between Pratik Gandhi and Yami Gautam. Gandhi, known for his impeccable comic timing, shines in a role that seems tailor-made for him. He embodies his character with a perfect blend of naivety and wit, drawing laughs with every line and every exaggerated expression. Gautam, as always, is a force to be reckoned with. Her comedic prowess is on full display, and she effortlessly complements Gandhi's energy, creating a dynamic duo that crackles with on-screen magic.But what truly sets the film apart is its commitment to originality. The jokes are fresh, the situations are unexpected, and the humor is often delightfully offbeat. It's a film that doesn't rely on cheap gags or overused comedic devices. Instead, it finds humor in the everyday, in the awkwardness of human interactions, and in the absurdity of life itself.The film's strength also lies in its ability to balance the comedic with the heartfelt. Amidst the laughter, there are moments of genuine emotion, moments that resonate with the audience and add depth to the story. It's a reminder that even in the most hilarious situations, there's always a human element, a connection that transcends the laughter.The movie is an example to the power of original storytelling and the importance of taking risks in comedy. It's a film that proves that you don't have to rely on tired formulas to make people laugh. Sometimes, all it takes is a fresh perspective, a willingness to be different, and a cast that understands the nuances of comedic timing.In a world where comedy often feels stale and predictable, is a breath of fresh air. It's a reminder that laughter can be intelligent, that humor can be original, and that cinema can still surprise and delight us. This is the kind of film that deserves to be celebrated, the kind of film that leaves you wanting more.If you're looking for a comedy that will tickle your funny bone and leave you with a smile on your face, look no further than the film. It's a cinematic experience that's too good to miss, a refreshing reminder of the power of laughter, and a testament to the brilliance of its cast and creators.",

Instead of offering a fresh perspective, it recycles familiar tropes without adding any unique flair, making the storyline predictable and uninspired. The attempts to emulate the style and substance of successful Western movies come across as desperate and unconvincing, lacking the cultural nuance and originality that could have set it apart.Yami Gautam Dhar and Pratik Gandhi, both talented actors, struggle to breathe life into their poorly sketched characters. Their on-screen chemistry is tepid, and their performances are marred by over-the-top expressions and forced humor that seldom lands. Director Rishab Seth fails to harness the potential of his cast, delivering a film that lacks cohesive vision and depth. The pacing is uneven, and the comedic elements feel contrived, further detracting from the overall experience.The screenplay is riddled with dialogues that attempt to be witty but end up being cringeworthy. A notable example is a monologue delivered by Yami Gautam's character, intended to address societal issues, which feels out of place and disrupts the narrative flow. Such instances highlight the film's struggle to balance humor with meaningful commentary, resulting in awkward and unengaging scenes.\"Dhoom Dhaam\" is a lackluster attempt at recreating the charm of Western action-comedies within a Bollywood framework. Its reliance on clich√©d plot devices, uninspired performances, and misguided direction culminate in a forgettable cinematic experience. The film serves as a reminder that successful storytelling requires more than mimicking established formulas; it demands originality, cultural authenticity, and a genuine connection with the audience.",

Also the eventual romance between the two characters was not believable given the way Koyal (Yami Gautam) had behaved throughout the movie.Plot:\nThe film begins with Koyal and Veer (Pratik Gandhi) who get have an arranged marriage without really knowing each other. On their wedding night they are accosted in their hotel room by two henchmen looking for \"Charlie\" which we later find out is an object. The rest of the film follows them evading the henchman while trying to locate Charlie.Acting:\nThe acting is fine but nothing special. Yami Gautum puts in a very capable performance byt Pratik Gandhi was not very convincing. Overall it was fine for this sort of a role.Conclusion:\nThere is a space for female led action movies but the hard handed way this film was handled was frankly silly. This was more of an agenda fueled movie rather than trying to tell an authentic story. Would give this one a miss, it isn't really worth your time and there is a lot of better content out there.4/10.",

The film brings together two completely opposite personalities, a free-spirited, party-loving girl and a shy, veteran doctor, who end up married. What follows is a series of fun, sometimes awkward, and mostly feel-good moments.Prateek Gandhi shines in his role, bringing charm and subtle humor, while Yami Gautam fits right in, making their chemistry enjoyable. The comedy works in parts-there are some genuinely funny scenes-but don't expect a laugh riot. The story itself is predictable but flows well, making it an easy watch.At its core, Dhoom Dhaam is a simple, no-pressure entertainer. It's not groundbreaking, and it doesn't try to be. Just go with the flow, enjoy the lighthearted moments, and you'll have a good time.Final Verdict: A fun time-pass movie-good for a relaxed watch!",

This film is nothing more than the latest installment in a long line of movies that trivialize betrayal and the real-life consequences of broken trust. Instead of offering a thoughtful exploration of complex relationships, it panders to a shallow, hedonistic impulse that undermines the values of commitment and integrity.The narrative not only misleads impressionable viewers-especially teenagers and those lacking maturity-but also contributes to a broader cultural erosion where deceit is celebrated as a form of rebellion. Rather than inspiring audiences with nuanced, responsible storytelling, this film reduces serious moral dilemmas to mere entertainment fodder, packaged for maximum commercial appeal at the expense of substance and decency.It is disheartening to see cinema, which has the power to shape societal norms, being used to promote such damaging ideals. This movie is a disgrace to both the art of filmmaking and to society at large.",

The couple promptly escapes and then starts the roller coaster run chase at night through the town. Both Yami playing Koyal and Pratik playing Veer are opposites in every sense. He is a phobia filled Gujarati vet ( I am a vegetarian, I can't eat my patients!). She is a full blooded fiesty Pujabi girl who gulps whiskey and shoots with enthusiasm. Together they make a terrific quirky couple.Director Rishab Seth fills the movie with an engrossing cocktail of comedy, action, slapstick, romance, music more than enough to keep you entertained. There are twists and turns with shady cops, a botched up robbery, kidnapping, a mysterious pen drive, unfaithful boyfriend etc etc all happening in a wild ride at a crazy pace at night. These misadventures are all presented in a humorous vein and it is light hearted fun all the way. The sitcom has lots of suspense filled action with surprises. Both actors have fully immersed themselves in their cranky roles. ( Watch Yami delivering the monologue and belting out expletives and Pratik doing the pole dance among other amusing scenes.)",

He has no doubt delivered a par performance but maybe a better actor in the comedy arena, would have made it a more complete package.The support cast has little to do in most scenes but the overall combo is wrapped up perfectly and makes for a viewing experience which is fun, fast paced and exciting.

Yami Gautam truly is a natural beauty and fairly underrated actress of Bollywood. Having Netflix featuring this movie it says how our industry has strived in the last two decades. It's a must watch movie. Can really enjoy with friends, family or alone. Best part is there are no overacting involved. Pratik Gandhi did an awesome job with his role. It was exactly how it needed to be. Something unique about this movie is if you select \"more like this\" in Netflix, it recommends some of the greats of the industry such as Barfi!",

I didn't look much into it except that I knew the voice actor who voices Geralt in the Witcher 3 game was coming back for this. Yes, there are parallels to the little mermaid but in the world of the witcher. But the changes made to the story from the books were more of a distraction for me and made it difficult to enjoy. Perhaps those who haven't read the books will get more enjoyment.The animation style was fun and allowed for more acrobatic fight scenes. But adding a sea witch who turns into a kraken was a little too Little Mermaid. And of course, they couldn't stop with just that change. Adding characters that don't exist in the book, changing characters from the books roll and the outcome of the whole story was too much and yet still somehow predictable.",

Now, I don't want to be one of those people who harps on about an adaptation not being faithful to the original, but Netflix had so much to work with here. Sapkowski's writing is full of nuance and depth and pathos - everything this adaptation is lacking. The movie goes for cheap, surface-level fantasy action and vandalizes the unique creative depth and character-work that makes Sapkowski's writing, at its best, exceptional. At its best, Netflix has been able to capture some of this - I think back to Renfri from the first episode of The Witcher. But in large part, Netflix has failed to capture what makes the IP special.

I fail to understand why these people think that this quippy character is funny. He's not funny and I detest every single line and moment he's in a scene. He's the comic relief that's completely unnecessary and his modernisms just take me right out of it. And the singing...Oh God, it's just so awful, it literally put me in a bad mood. Having just watched Castlevania Nocturne, I was very disappointed by the animation, as well. At times, it looked like a 90s Disney animated film and that's just a shame. Clearly, Netflix and the team who's in charge of this IP have learned absolutely NOTHING from the backlash after the last season and it's a shame because getting the original voice actor from the games was a welcome surprise but after the first fight, the movie goes quickly downhill and it's soooooo bad that we turned it off around the 50 min mark.

Meanwhile, a string of mysterious deaths raises the stakes, and Geralt is hired by the king to put an end to the romance while uncovering the truth behind the killings.The voice cast is impressive, featuring familiar names from the live-action series such as Anya Chalotra (Yennefer) and Joey Batey (Jaskier). Additionally, Doug Cockle, the iconic voice of Geralt from *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*, lends his talents here, alongside the talented Emily Carey as Sh'eenaz.Visually, the animation is fluid and well-crafted, capturing the dark, gritty essence of *The Witcher* universe. The storyline feels authentic to the franchise, balancing action, humor, and an intriguing mystery. While I did predict the twist before the reveal, it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Overall, this is an engaging and well-executed addition to *The Witcher* franchise.

This short story, from the book Sword of Destiny, is one of my favorites of all the short stories. The story is touching, funny, and touched on a lot of different subjects. Geralt is hired by Agloval to serve as a translator to speak with a Merwoman he is in love with. Along the way, Geralt and Dandelion meet up with Esi, a female bard. The sexual tension between her and Geralt in the story is well written. But in this anime movie, they've completely made Esi different from what she was in the short story. Instead, she is more of the aggressor, as well as knowing how to fight, can interpret, and apparently is from the town this takes place in, as well as having family. In the short story, she actually wasn't from the town, didn't know the prince, and just seems to be someone that knows everything. These changes affects her interaction with Geralt in a negative way in this story. And adding so much back story with Esi and Dandelion and the prince and his brother, as well as tying this movie to the live-action Netflix series is something else I didn't really like. So many characters have been changed from what they were, as well as so many added back stories that I feel detract from the relationship that Dandelion and Esi have in the short story. And adding a \"sea witch\" and other aspects that were there just ruins the story for me. I just wish they could have stuck more to the story as it was written, but then this is Netflix, so why am I surprised? A perfectly well written story in the book that could have been told pretty faithfully, but they had to insert messages that weren't there, change characters from what they were, has pretty much ruined this story for me. I only give a 4 stars because of Doug Cockle voicing Geralt. Hearing Geralt as he was in the games was excellent. Doug knows Geralt as he has voiced him through three games. Just wish they would have stuck to the lore of the story more faithfully.",

        "content": "\"The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep\" Fails to Capture the Spirit of Its Origins It's no surprise that Henry Cavill isn't involved in this latest Witcher project. The fingerprints of Lauren Schmidt Hissrich's influence on the franchise are impossible to ignore, and it's clear that the lackluster approach to this adaptation follows a troubling pattern seen in other recent franchise revivals: a blatant disregard for the source material and the use of an established fan base as a vehicle for mediocrity. Rather than taking the time to create a meaningful, original story set in the Witcher universe, the creators of Sirens of the Deep have resorted to the common tactic of purchasing a beloved franchise, not to honor it, but to milk it for its existing appeal. It's become a predictable, frustrating trend: writers and creators latch onto an established intellectual property (IP) and fail to put in the work necessary to develop something worthwhile, instead opting to lean on the existing fan loyalty to carry the weight of their subpar creation. This is, quite frankly, an insult to both the legacy of the franchise and its audience. What's even more egregious, however, is the degree to which the creators of Sirens of the Deep have simply plagiarized aspects of another beloved story-The Little Mermaid-with all the subtlety of a hammer to the face. The parallels are so glaringly obvious that it's difficult to understand how this wasn't a conscious, deliberate decision. Characters, plot beats, and key story elements are lifted straight from the classic tale, with no attempt to disguise the parallels. It's a lazy and uninspired adaptation, relying on tired tropes instead of creating something fresh within the rich, complex world that Sapkowski's Witcher novels and the games have built. The lack of originality here is staggering. In a world where creatives are constantly urged to innovate, it's disheartening to see such a transparent attempt to cut corners, relying on a tired rehash of a well-known story that most viewers will recognize immediately. If you are familiar with The Little Mermaid, it's practically impossible to ignore the parallels-and that's not a compliment. This isn't just a missed opportunity-it's a betrayal of the Witcher universe and a disservice to its fans. Conclusion: The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep doesn't just fail to capture the essence of the original material-it actively undermines it. Instead of offering a thoughtful, engaging story, it relies on tired, uninspired tropes that have been recycled from other sources. The creators' failure to put any meaningful effort into honoring the franchise is only amplified by their lack of originality and blatant plagiarism. It's a disappointing addition to the Witcher legacy, and frankly, it deserves to be called out for what it is.. a disgraceful pathetic waste. PS. I created this account today only for the purposes of leaving this review.",

Yet another tale in the vein of The Little Mermaid, even though Sapkowski originally wrote it as a critique of clich√© fantasy tropes. The lack of nuance stripped the story of its depth-particularly in the relationship between Essi and Geralt, which was meant to explore shades of gray. Instead, the creators opted for a black-and-white narrative that completely hollowed out the emotional weight of the original. The only real positive is the animation of the fight scenes, though at times they feel more flashy than truly impactful.",

This show does a much better job of staying FAITHFUL to the source material and takes a lot of positive inspiration from the video game. They even got many of the original video game voice actor , who reprise their roles and nail the setting of this movie perfectly.The weakest part of the movie comes in form of the final half, where logic goes out of the window and Geralt for some reason refuses to use 90% of his arsenal during battle. I honestly feel like an entirely different writing team handled the climax scenes and failed MISERABLY.Visually it is nothing special, but the aesthetic is true to the source and really makes you feel like you are back in the game.The movie is not a masterpiece, but give it a chance, it is a much better watch than the live action TV show, or at least better than what the TV show later became.",

He does triple spins, jumps incredibly high, does not die from fall damage like in the video games, and his signs (the small, basic magic witchers use) are incredibly powerful. His IQ seems to have also increased, as the Geralt in this movie uses his signs really creatively. Anyone giving this movie a rating below 7/10 is just a dumb hater, who cannot separate their hate of Netflix. This movie is a must-watch for anyone. It contains the true spirit of The Witcher world with brutality, deep discussions and life philosophy, hot women, the bard cracking silly jokes and most importantly, badass monster killing and detective work.

So you go to location 100% in favor of your enemy, using weapons that won't affect them in water, without a way to defend ship from ... bottom (best of all movie shows how this would basically end in first 15 minutes), fighting with an enemy highly skilled in magic (which humans knew) using melee. Story twists and bends to accommodate for this stupidity but fails miserably. Who the hell came with this stupid idea ??Geralts motivations are... odd at best, inconsequencial at worst. Sometimes fighting humans (without good reason) sometimes monsters (with better reasons.. ) in \"same-ish\" circumstances.All in all - all of the spectacle, nice animations, Doug Cockle reprisng Geralt, fall short due to brain rotted screenplay for this disappointing movie.And adding insult to injruy, all of the new songs (especially \"Little mermaid\" inspired and implemented totally out of character for Melusine) suck terribly, same as voice acting of the cast of main show (they really seem to struggle with this form of acting).",

It's like, you're waiting for your ordered steak in a restaurant, and they bring you a piece of raw, rotten meat with worms, which the chef calls a delicacy, well, that's how he sees it. The plot is twisted, some unnecessary new characters, unnecessary events were invented, but those that were fundamental and created the essence of the story written in the book were thrown out. I won't spoil it. Just read the book, it will be more useful for both the mind and the senses. And to those who say, \"-well, this is an adaptation\", I'll say then adapt something else and don't spoil the good things.I understand that Netflix executives, like rams, will run into a thick concrete wall and think that this will destroy it. They ruined the series, the prequel to it, and now the cartoon. What kind of \"talent\" must you have to ruin everything like that, instead of earning a couple of billions on it. I especially want to mention Lauren Schmidt-Hissrich, a talentless, ambitious person who \"has her own vision\". I think a lot of fans have already mentioned \"not evil\" and \"kind\" words to everyone involved in this nonsense, as well as wishes of \"good health\" and \"prosperity.\"",

Honestly I'd almost recommend watching this film purely to laugh at this disaster.Sirens of the Deep becomes that much worse when you consider how wonderfully written the original story is written. This film takes perhaps my favourite Witcher short story and massacres it.Why do they hire people with egos so big that they feel as though they have to change things so drastically? They did the same thing with the show. Take an award winning, widely loved book series, and then shit all over it.What an embarrassment.I will mention the two good things in this film. Dandelion, sorry Jaskier, has great banter with Geralt and manages to capture their relationship well.

No strong feelings one way or the other.The combat is just slightly above par. There are a few good fights, but Geralt does too many flips and downward attacks. None of it conveys impact or significance, and gives the impression of choreography rehearsal. Included are also some twists and turns befitting a Witcher story, but much of it feels artificial. Like they were trying for this specific thing the Witcher is known for and you can tell. Honestly, the best part is Geralt being himself, and his interactions with Essi. Outside of Jaskier (who is exactly as you expect him to be), Essi is the only character worth paying attention to, and unsurprisingly one that ultimately justified the time spent watching. But even then, her best scenes come at the end.Recommended for casual fans only.",

That war is touch and go, verging on stalemate, when the audacious \"Char\" manages to steal a prototype mobile suit (think \"Pacific Rim\") and turn it on their designers. It's a battle royal that ensues but as that concludes the enigmatic young \"Char\" disappears. The second part of the story skips on a few years as the search for \"Char\" and his suit has still to bear fruit, but a feisty young girl is the one to beat as she takes to her new \"Gundam\" suit only to find she seems to have natural powers to augment it's formidable capabilities. What's going on with her and where is the redoubtable champion? Well we don't find any of that out here, as this is just the start of the series, but what we do have works well enough as a stand alone adventure. The first section was my favourite, with much more intergalactic action, battles and combat going on. The second part reverted a little to the more traditionally frat-based team contest which attracts a bit less, but there's still plenty going on and it teases the rest of the story encouragingly. It's short and sweet and worth a watch.",

While the marketing built hype around a gripping storyline, the execution felt sluggish, predictable, and underwhelming.One of the biggest letdowns was the screenplay. The story had potential, but it was riddled with clich√©s and forced twists that felt more confusing than thrilling. Instead of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, Daagi dragged through unnecessary subplots and weak character development.Afran Nisho's performance was another mixed bag. While he has proven his acting skills in dramas, his portrayal in Daagi felt overdone at times and completely flat in others. The emotional depth needed for the character was missing, making it hard to connect with his journey. The supporting cast also struggled, with many performances feeling either exaggerated or lifeless.The direction and cinematography were also underwhelming. The film tried to create a dark, intense atmosphere, but poor pacing and inconsistent editing killed any tension it built. The action sequences lacked impact, and the background score, instead of enhancing the experience, often felt mismatched and overused.Overall, Daagi fails to live up to expectations. It's a forgettable thriller that neither excites nor leaves a lasting impression. With a tighter script and better execution, this could have been a strong entry in Afran Nisho's film career, but unfortunately, it falls short in almost every way.Rating: 2/10.",

While the beginning is intriguing, the story quickly becomes disjointed and predictable.

The emotional expressions of the lead character often feel forced and artificial. Additionally, the background music doesn't always match the scenes, causing the dialogue to lose its impact.However, the cinematography and a few action sequences provide some positive points. But these can't make up for the weak script, lack of character depth, and erratic editing.In short, Daagi feels like an unfinished attempt-there was a desire to do something good, but the execution falls short.Watch it if you're really looking for something to pass the time, but if not, it's best to skip it.",

Almost every scene felt like a stretched version of a typical soap opera.The characters were completely one-dimensional-with no depth or real emotion. It was hard to understand what they were doing and why.The dialogues were extremely clich√© and often irrelevant-sometimes even laughable. The acting wasn't impressive either. Some actors did try, but the weak script and poor direction failed to support them.The cinematography and editing were also below standard. Some scenes were cut in such a way that it felt like watching a low-budget drama downloaded from YouTube.And most annoying of all were the unnecessary songs. They had no connection to the story but were forcefully added anyway.All in all, watching Dagi felt like a waste of time. Anyone who went in expecting a quality film likely came out disappointed.",

He doesn't just play the role; he lives it, etching Nishan into the annals of memorable cinematic characters. This performance alone is worth the price of admission and then some. Many viewers are already suggesting he deserves national recognition for this portrayal.Adding to the brilliance is Tama Mirza as Zerin, who brings a refreshing and compelling presence to the screen. Her chemistry with Afran Nisho is palpable, adding another layer of depth to the emotionally charged narrative.

Her actions and dialogues only serve to infuriate the audience, as if the director deliberately wanted to antagonize anyone with even a shred of sensibility.The climax dialogue is the ultimate insult, where Venkatesh smugly talks about \"empowering men\" when asked if he offended women. Empowering men? Really? It's laughable how the director thought this was profound. Instead, it just exposes his own narrow, chauvinistic worldview.This movie is not just frustrating it's infuriating.

This is his third collaboration with Venkatesh. The basic premise of the story is it is a rescue mission. Venkatesh plays a suspended cop who goes back to his hometown, gets married and has four children. I did not know a cop can be suspended for 6 years. Anyway, he is called back to lead lead a rescue mission and Meenu, played by Meenakshi Choudhary, goes to him to convince him as they had a relationship in the past. Now happily married to Bhagyam, played by Aishwarya Rajesh, how he deals with his ex-girlfriend showing up at this doorstep and how his possessive and seemingly uneducated wife reacts forms the rest of the story.You don't expect anything big in a slapstick comedy. While the comedy worked in parts with two to three genuine laugh out loud moments in the first half, nothing stays with you once the movie is over. The insipid writing which is basically a few instagram reels stringed together to generate laughs, forced emotions and sentiments make this a chore to watch. It is almost as if the director had a checklist of things he should include in a \"festival film\" to get families to theaters. There is comedy, there is sentiment, there is a message, there is emotion, there are fights but nothing feels organic.Venkatesh excelled in his role as this is nothing new for him. Aishwarya Rajesh did a brilliant job with her expressions and dialogue delivery. The little kid who played Venkatesh's son was hilarious. The LOL moments that I had were because of him. But beyond these three aspects, the movie offers nothing. Not even a coherent story. Pass this one and you wouldn't miss anything.-YT/@CinephileIndia2023.",

        "content": "Sankrathiki Vasthunam, starring Venkatesh, Aishwarya, and Meenakshi, is a delightful throwback to the golden era of Telugu cinema. It blends comedy, drama, and family emotions into a package that feels like a much-needed break from today's high-octane action thrillers. While it has its share of flaws, the movie's charm and nostalgia overshadow the occasional missteps, delivering an overall enjoyable experience.The story revolves around Venkatesh's character, a loving father and husband, who tries to balance family life amidst chaos created by an archetypal Telugu film villain. The plot may not win points for originality, as the tropes and the antagonist feel very much like something we've seen before in Telugu cinema. However, where the movie truly shines is in its execution. The director ensures that the predictable storyline is infused with heartwarming moments, witty dialogues, and engaging performances that keep the audience entertained throughout.Aishwarya delivers a standout performance, surpassing all expectations. Her portrayal of a determined and emotional character feels authentic and heartfelt, leaving a lasting impression. She even outshines the child artist playing Venkatesh's son, who otherwise does a commendable job adding innocence and humor to the narrative. Aishwarya's ability to evoke both laughter and tears makes her the soul of the movie, elevating even the simplest scenes with her screen presence.Venkatesh, as always, brings his signature charm and impeccable comic timing to the table. His role as a father navigating familial conflicts and external threats feels relatable, especially for fans of his earlier family-oriented films. Meenakshi complements him well, bringing a grace and subtlety to her character, though her screen time is limited compared to the leads.The comedy in Sankrathiki Vasthunam deserves special mention. The humor is rooted in everyday situations and relationships, reminiscent of classic Telugu family dramas. It's refreshing to watch a film where laughter doesn't rely on over-the-top gimmicks but instead emerges naturally from the characters and their interactions. The movie feels like a speed breaker in today's cinema landscape, offering a breather from the action-packed dramas that dominate the industry.That said, Sankrathiki Vasthunam isn't without its flaws. Certain moments feel outdated or overly dramatic, bordering on cringe-worthy. The villain, while performed decently, is a typical Telugu cinema antagonist-loud, menacing, and one-dimensional. These elements might take away from the experience for some viewers, but the film's charm and heart make up for its shortcomings.Another aspect worth appreciating is the nostalgic vibe that the movie brings.

        "content": "Anil Ravipudi is one of the rare directors in the Telugu film industry who consistently delivers commercial comedy movies that appeal to a broad audience. His style is a unique blend of the legendary directors EVV Satyanarayana and Jandhyala. While EVV was known for his mass-appeal humor, Jandhyala brought subtle, situational comedy, and Ravipudi combines the best of both. His films are family-friendly and entertaining for all age groups. Among his works, F2 is a personal favorite of mine-it's one of those movies I can watch any time. When you pair his direction with a veteran actor like Venkatesh, who has impeccable comic timing, the result is pure magic. After F2 and F3, their third collaboration, Sankranthiki Vasthunam, arrives with high expectations-and it doesn't disappoint.The movie stays true to the high standards set by F2. While the story might not feel entirely new, it's Ravipudi's unique characterizations, screenplay, and dialogues, paired with Venkatesh's unparalleled comic timing and performance, that elevate the film. Ravipudi's strength lies in creating relatable characters-people you'd find in your neighborhood or family gatherings. Telugu audiences, known for their love of comedy and natural sense of humor, will resonate with this film's conversational and situational comedy. While some cinematic liberties are taken, they are never overdone and blend seamlessly with the storytelling, ensuring a thoroughly enjoyable experience.The plot revolves around an ex-policeman who gets entangled between his wife and his ex-girlfriend, all while managing a critical task assigned by the Chief Minister. Ravipudi ensures there's never a dull moment, maintaining a perfect balance between comedy and action. The action sequences, surprisingly, are as impressive as in any action-centric film and keep you on the edge of your seat.One standout element is the role of Venkatesh's on-screen son, a boy spoiled by watching OTT movies. His antics generate some of the most hilarious moments in the film. This subplot is both entertaining and relevant, reflecting the current trend of kids being heavily influenced by OTT content, including inappropriate language. The humor here is sharp and relatable, reminding me of the train episode with the child character in Ravi Teja's Venky movie. This boy has a bright future ahead.The music by Bheems Ceciroleo is another big asset to the film. The songs are catchy, and the background score, including a quirky frog sound used in key moments, adds to the fun. Aishwarya Rajesh, as the wife, delivers a solid performance, which comes as no surprise given her acting pedigree. Meenakshi Chaudhary, as the ex-girlfriend, also shines in her role. And then there's Venkatesh-he's in top form. Whether as a dashing cop in action sequences or a relatable husband managing a chaotic family life with four kids, his versatility is on full display.The supporting cast deserves praise too, as every character contributes meaningfully to the story. The editing is sharp, and the unexpected double climax feels fresh and innovative.In an era where filmmakers often focus on pan-India high-budget action dramas, it's refreshing to see a wholesome family entertainer like this. Sankranthiki Vasthunam is a true \"Telugu\" film that's perfect for the festive season.",

I am genuinely surprised that it became a hit, given the myriad of shortcomings that plague this film. Firstly, the jokes fall flat and fail to elicit any laughter, rendering the comedy aspect completely ineffective. The forced humor feels more like an arduous chore to sit through than an enjoyable experience.Adding to the movie's list of grievances, many scenes are set against unnecessary artificial backdrops when they could have easily been shot outdoors, lending a certain falseness to the visual presentation. This overreliance on artificial sets detracts from the movie's authenticity and overall appeal. Moreover, the ending is poorly executed and leaves much to be desired. It felt rushed and did not provide a satisfying conclusion to the story arc.I also believe that actor Naresh was a poor choice for the role of the Telangana Chief Minister. His portrayal lacked the gravitas and charisma needed for such a pivotal character. As for the much-hyped child character, it was far from amusing and added little to the narrative, failing to live up to its exaggerated expectations.In summation, Anil Ravipudi's effort with this film was disappointing, especially considering the high standards he set with his previous works, F2 and F3. This movie fell completely flat, failing to capture the magic and charm that made his earlier films successful. Overall, it was an underwhelming cinematic experience that left me yearning for the level of entertainment I had come to expect from Ravipudi.",

        "content": "'Sankranthiki Vasthunam' movie review: Anil Ravipudi and Venkatesh's film delivers mindless laughs\nAnil Ravipudi and Venkatesh Daggubati go all out to entertain in their third collaboration, 'Sankranthiki Vasthunam', not too weighed down by the need to be politically correct.A character named Bulli Raju, played by child actor Revanth, mouths expletives that send grown-ups into a tizzy. We hear some of these words while the rest is masked by the background score. A section of the audience may wonder why the filmmaker makes a boy say things beyond his age. The very next minute, writer-director Anil Ravipudi's Telugu film Sankranthiki Vasthunam reasons that the young mind has been corrupted by an overdose of content on digital platforms! Bulli Raju's antics in an early scene bring the house down and set the tone for the film. Teaming up with Venkatesh Daggubati for the third time, after the farcical comedies F2 and F3, Anil is aware that all his target audiences want are a few good laughs. Logical reasoning and political correctness can take a backseat. Within that framework, the film delivers several laughs. Sankranthiki Vasthunam keeps things simple and fun, laced occasionally with observations about oft-repeated tropes and the changing trends in mainstream Telugu cinema. A few decades ago, it was not too uncommon to see films woven around a male protagonist, his wife, and a girlfriend. The drama surrounding former police officer YD Raju (Venkatesh, nicknamed by his colleagues as Yama Dharma Raju), police officer and his former girlfriend Meenakshi (Meenakshi Chaudhary) and his wife Bhagyalakshmi (Aishwarya Rajesh) is a throwback to that era. There is also a reference to Venkatesh's earlier film Intlo Illalu Vantintlo Priyuralu. The stage for this aspect of the drama is set, in a hilarious manner, with Raju invoking divine references. The laughs that follow through the film, involving the women, are silly and border on farce. Venkatesh, Meenakshi, and Aishwarya go with the flow as the narrative does not hold back the fun. Venkatesh's monologue in the final portions takes the cake. In another film, if this monologue had been delivered on a serious note, it would have earned the wrath of women. The makers of this film know that their narrative will not be taken seriously.This is a film in which the crime element, involving a kidnap drama, is also dealt with in a light-hearted manner. It is a familiar template. A high profile personality is kidnapped, a rescue operation begins, a convict is demanded as ransom... you get the drift. It is no surprise that YD Raju is summoned for the job. Several others enter the mix, including Raju's possessive and suspicious wife and the volatile son, Bulli Raju. The film also introduces a few other oddball characters. Look out for Upendra Limaye as the jailer and Sai Kumar as an officer who has to deal with his egoistic overtures.Visually, Sankranthiki Vasthunam is a riot of colours in tune with Sankranti festival.",

While it tries to mix action, comedy, and family emotions, it ultimately delivers none of them effectively.Weak and Predictable StorylineThe biggest letdown of the movie is its unimaginative and predictable storyline. Within the first 20 minutes, you can already guess exactly how the movie will play out. It follows the same formulaic structure of outdated Telugu commercial films-over-the-top heroism, forced comedy, and an emotional climax that lacks any real impact. The writers clearly put little effort into creating anything fresh or engaging.Venkatesh Deserves BetterVenkatesh is a veteran actor with a knack for comedy, but here, he seems to be sleepwalking through his role. His dialogues are uninspiring, and his comic timing, which has been his strength for decades, feels off. The script doesn't allow him to showcase his true potential, and instead, he is stuck delivering repetitive, outdated jokes that barely land.Female Characters Have No PurposeAishwarya Rajesh and Meenakshi Chaudhary's characters exist only for the sake of having female leads. Aishwarya Rajesh, who is known for her powerful performances, is criminally underutilized in a role that barely contributes to the story. Meenakshi Chaudhary as a police officer is simply unbelievable-her character is weakly written and lacks any real depth. They are mere props in a male-dominated script that doesn't even try to give them meaningful arcs.Forced and Cringe-Worthy ComedyComedy should be the movie's strongest point, but it's its biggest weakness. The jokes are outdated and feel like recycled versions of humor we have seen a hundred times before. Instead of witty dialogues, we get loud, over-exaggerated expressions and unnecessary slapstick that don't evoke laughter. The supporting comedians are wasted, and the timing of the jokes makes the film feel longer than it actually is.Forgettable Music and Weak CinematographyBheems Ceciroleo's music is another disappointment. Not a single song stays with you after leaving the theater, and they only serve as filler moments in an already weak film. Even the festive elements in the background don't add the energy one would expect from a Sankranthi release. The cinematography is uninspired, failing to make even the grand festival visuals look appealing.Dragged-Out Second HalfThe second half is painfully slow, with unnecessary emotional drama that feels forced rather than organic. The climax, which should have been an emotional or action-packed high point, is a complete letdown, wrapping up the movie in a rushed and unconvincing manner.Final VerdictSankranthiki Vasthunam is a movie that neither entertains nor engages. It's a collection of outdated tropes, predictable storytelling, and forced comedy that doesn't work. If you're a fan of Venkatesh, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a fresh, fun Sankranthi entertainer, you're better off skipping this one.",

        "content": "Major annual celebrations like Christmas and New Year are not just broadly fun times, but are also excuse to pump out trashy comedies in every country large enough to make it viable, so it's no surprise that the same happened this year with Sankranthi - apparently the sun transmigration festival. This is a Telugu-language film (incidentally, the first one I have seen) - and Andhra Pradesh, the heartland of Telugu speakers, also apparently hosts the largest concentration of movie theaters in India, so the market was clearly there.Let's not mince words - Sankranthiki Vasthunam is the kind of a film I have not seen in a long time - and for good reason.The kind of film which does not even make ANY attempt at fight scene choreography and either makes \"bad guys\" run straight into others' weapons or simply edits past the fights to their conclusion.The kind of a film which films a scene inside an ambulance with what I'm 99% is an obvious \"CGI\" backdrop in the windows. (And similarly represents gunfire with extremely fake \"sparks\" in a way I have not seen in forever.)The kind of a film with unfunny attempts at comedy that go on way too long and recurring gags which miss way more often than they hit.And the kind of a film which has the main character break the fourth wall and directly lecture at the camera when the script decides it's time to get even remotely serious and deliver a message.Additionally, it somehow manages the feat of being silly while ALSO unironically venerating police violence - the male lead's forced retirement for \"human rights\" concerns is portrayed as pure corruption on the part of superiors, yet he is literally shown to kill in ambushes without any chance at a surrender.Having said that, it does have a few saving graces which prevent me from rating it even lower. While it's never a remotely great comedy, considerably more jokes land in the first half than the second. The first half also has the better songs - while none rise even close to music from last year's Malayalam Premalu in either lyricism or sequence direction, they are fun enough and better than some of the other Indian film songs I've heard.Last and by no means least, it's refreshing to see a narrative where lovers separated start moving on fairly quickly, with too many far more acclaimed Western films from last year instead making lead characters imprint onto their first significant relationship like ducklings.In all, there's a foundation of a much better comedy here, but it got buried under scene after scene of self-indulgent tripe.",

The problem with this film is the lack of humorous scenes. Even in F2, the first half was filled with back to back hilarious scenes before getting derailed in the second half. Sankranthiki Vasthunnam is simply devoid of that as the initial 40mins simply drags on painfully with none of the supposed comedy scenes working. Once the story begins, the comedy scenes doesn't improve and the bit involving Upendra Limaye - Sai Kumar was the only slight relief which over stayed it's welcome. Maybe the initial crowd response/hype caused by mass hysteria helped the film, but for the OTT viewing at home, the film is largely unfunny and an in-form Venkatesh couldn't save it.",

But I still opted to watch \"Into the Deep\", as it was a movie that I had never heard about.The storyline in the movie was okay. I mean, it wasn't as if writers Chad Law and Josh Ridgway revolutionized the shark genre by any means. But the storyline was adequately entertaining for what it was, though it was somewhat generic. And in all honesty, don't we measure all shark movies up against the mother of all shark movies \"Jaws\" whether we want to or not?Of the entire cast ensemble, I was only familiar with Richard Dreyfuss and Jon Seda. It was actually nice to see Richard Dreyfuss return to a shark-themed movie. The acting performances in the movie were good.The effects in \"Into the Deep\" were good. At least director Christian Sesma didn't opt to use stock footage of sharks, which generally just dumbs down a movie unnecessarily so.Watchable, for sure, if you enjoy shark movies, but hardly a noteworthy foray into the shark-infested depths.

The dive is fraught with danger, the area a hunting ground for great whites, but the biggest danger comes from a gang of modern day pirates who will stop at nothing to recover a cache of drugs from the seabed.A few of the CGI shark effects are surprisingly decent, but some are really bad; however, the humans in the film are uniformly awful, with Taylor-Compton leading the way, never once convincing as a marine biologist suffering from PTSD. The cast might have fared better if the script hadn't been such a stodgy mess of overused clich√©s, but the film does very little to distinguish itself from numerous other straight to streaming shark movies.3/10.",

It pulls you in with a compelling story and keeps you hooked with its suspenseful atmosphere.

I'd recommend waiting for this semi-thriller to arrive on OTT platforms. The first half is definitely worth experiencing, but the second half might leave you feeling disappointed.Overall:\n* Strengths: Gripping first half, engaging pacing, intriguing characters.* Weaknesses: Confusing second half, convoluted plot, underwhelming twists.* Recommendation: Wait for OTT release.

        "content": "Synopsis of this review - While the overall movie is visually stunning and seems promising in the beginning with a lot of scientific jargon thrown in good measure, you have a feeling at the end of the movie that many of the scenes are forced and the script writers are found lacking in terms of the premises they chose (the movie would have still made sense without the OCD part), the way they force scenes onto you just to make their job easier and a lack of logic throughout.Some of the questions I was left pondering over at the end of the movie:1) Why OCD?Having watched films like 'North 24 Kaatham' and 'Hey Jude' just to mention a couple of them in Malayalam, this movie really doesn't require that premise to carry the story forward. It was probably used to confuse the viewers, but at the end of the day an air marshal would find it difficult to operate if he had OCD. It is very likely that the rigorous screening to get into such a job would filter out such people, whether you like it or not. You don't need to have OCD to be a good sketch artist or an air marshal. On the contrary, you would expect people with OCD have a tough time concentrating, among many other shortcomings, for doing such a job. Being a perfectionist is different from having OCD. If this was done to get the viewers to sympathise with Haran, I would say he didn't need.2) Writers resort to a form of 'deus ex machina' or a form of 'plot convenience'?A) The antagonist randomly gets to live in the same building as the antagonist and the protagonist then gets assigned for no obvious reason to sketch in a police investigation in front of the antagonist. Would have made a lot more sense if this was all planned by either one of them.B) How was it that all the witnesses were on the same flight without neither the police nor the army knowing?C) How could the antagonist be sure that the plane would crash for sure, and even if it did, that all the witnesses would die especially on the ground? Blackmailing one of the pilots would have made more sense.D) Mentioning during one of the most important scenes that the projected super villain is not the real one in just one dialogue.E) This is a sensitive topic, and even the supervillain had doubts with this. Would the threat of posting explicit videos of a family member drive people to commit to such extreme obedience? This seems like it is from the 80s 90s era. It can still happen now, but you can't be sure.F) Alisha being hit by a truck randomly?G) Hard drive corrupted because Allen was in the XRay room? Too convenient?3) Logical failures?A) Why did Alisha think that Haran was trying to kill her? She clearly saw the molester blackmailing the ATCO before Haran burnt down the warehouse.B) Why did Haran draw his own portrait the first time? Allen was smoking in a corner and not looking at the sketch. Haran could have easily modified the sketch to look like someone else. I understand that it was a revelation to himself that Alisha was a witness, but still could have managed to pull this off being as smart as he is.C) After Haran manages to run Allen off the road into a cliff during the car chase, he seems to be not looking at the road and then when he looks back holds his arm covering his head as if to suggest an impending collision. But later it is shown that he walks out of his car to check on Allen and he gets shot right in his chest which looks lethal with blood splattering. A couple of scenes/days later Haran is shown perfectly alright.D) If it was that easy for Allen to adopt a new identity and vanish into thin air, why go to all this trouble?E) Haran being such a great sketch artist should have got Alisha to describe the face of the ATCO and sketched it himself and let someone else match it with the passengers rather than letting her figure it out knowing that she has problems with just that.4) Random musings/Loose threads?A) What was Haran planning to do by picking the lock of the apartment Alisha was living in? Does not show any clear motive.B) I'm not entirely sure about this and I'll give the benefit of doubt to the writers. But if Allen spoke to Alisha when he came to pick her up assuming she would think he is Haran because he was disguised as Haran, I'm sure Alisha should have been able to differentiate them with their voice. If this scene is not in the movie it could have been used to elevate the movie by portraying that she is in doubt.C) What was the chain that Allen handed over to Mandira Bedi and what was their relationship?D) Why the fascination with r*pe videos used as tools to control people?E) Why cut short the narrative of Alisha having mistaken Allen for Haran (which would have made the film's title 'Identity' a lot more sensible) so easily in a few scenes? Starting the movie with mistaken identities and then finally setting them right would have made the movie superlative.Conclusion - I only went to the trouble of writing this long review because I saw potential. I would like to end by quoting Ranga Annan - 'Shradhikkanam Ambane!'.",

Not even a single character leaves a sentimental impression on the audience while the cinema is over. There is little emotional content that can be felt and related.The thriller part does not excite audience who have witnessed better movies. There is a whole load of stuff as thrilling packed, but without any effect.The theme is somewhat new, however, not novel. There are many occasions where improbable surpasses reality, which fails to connect to the audience.

        "content": "In many ways, Identity is technically superior to Forensic and boasts some interesting characters (like that of Tovino's and Trisha's). But the \"hack\" writing that somewhat derailed Akhil Paul & Anas Khan's previous venture is a major drawback here too. This is a film with several twists and turns, though none of them pack a serious punch. It's almost as if the writers knew this beforehand, so they've tried their best to salvage it in the making. As such, we're treated to some slick action blocks, both on land and in the air. Most of the exposition has a Wikipedia-reading feel to it, packed with a little too much info. Sure, it helps provide additional context, but do we really need SO MANY characters and subplots to get to the rather obvious conclusion?The technical aspects are commendable - Yannick Ben and Phoenix Prabhu effectively crack the stunts, DoP Akhil George captures the leads and proceedings stunningly, and Jakes Bejoy delivers a killer score (though a bit reminiscent of Forensic). Visual effects are also largely decent (with the exception Aju Varghese's moustache). The screenplay could've gone in interesting directions, especially with respect to Trisha's character. But when the focus shifts to Tovino's Haran Shankar (sketch-artist-turned-whatever), the film starts faltering big time. I think the writer-director duo needs to ensure that their next screenplay is fat-free, unnecessary-characters-free, and most importantly, uses non-linearity only if it amps up the (actual) thrill quotient.",

He did one of his best performances and that might have saved this movie from being a flop . The Movie was cinematographed kind of Hollywood level but should have been a bit more bright . Bgm and other things were good. Expected more dialogues from Trisha but the script demanded less dialogues. To Summarise, only the last half an hour of the movie was worth the ticket and rest of the movie lagged for most parts.",

Directed by Akhil Paul and Anas Khan, the film follows forensic sketch artist Haran Shankar (Tovino Thomas) as he gets entangled in a complex investigation led by CI Allen Jacob (Vinay Rai). Trisha Krishnan plays Alisha, an investigative journalist with a unique cognitive condition that adds an intriguing layer to the narrative. With unpredictable twists, intense action sequences, and a suspenseful screenplay, the film keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.Tovino Thomas delivers a standout performance, portraying his character's depth with subtlety and precision, while Vinay Rai adds intensity to the investigation. Trisha Krishnan makes a solid comeback in Malayalam cinema, though her role could have been explored further. The film's technical brilliance, including Akhil George's striking cinematography and Jakes Bejoy's gripping background score, enhances its overall impact. Identity sets a new benchmark for investigative thrillers in Malayalam cinema, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre.",

        "content": "The movie disappoints in more than one way. Thrillers are in trend in Malayalam, so the movie makers start the movie as a thriller and take it to a complete masala mode.We are introduced to Tovino Thomas' character with a background story which creates some expectations on his behaviour later but nothing of the sort happens. This supposedly OCD person who likes order is always unshaved with an untrimmed semi-beard. They show him as an artist and Trisha as a person with a photographic memory. Forget a photographic memory, she has less than average memory throughout the movie then why unnecessarily create that hype.The writers clearly had no proper story when they started the shoot and were building it up as it went. The movie goes into complete nonsense mode after 30 minutes, where the events seem to happen at random with illogical background stories. Mandira Bedi plays a character which any junior artiste could have played. The cast is either overacting or underacting. Trisha has just one expression throughout the movie, wondering why she is doing this poorly written role. Tovino Thomas has a build-up like a Telugu Hero, but he has never had the screen presence of a mass Hero, so it looks irritating to see him act as one. In the last 30 minutes, you have to question whether Mallus can make a nonsensical plot like this. The passenger list is available before the flight leaves, so why would you constrain yourselves to identify someone from the list when the flight is in transit? Then, there was the horrible private plane fight sequence. Why would you attempt a Vijay movie in Malayalam? Tovino is intolerable in every scene of the movie. I liked him in his earlier movies, but this is a new low for him.Watch at your own risk, absolute waste of time.",

        "title": "A Promising Concept Falls Flat in \"Identity\"",
        "content": "I recently had the opportunity to watch \"Identity\", a Malayalam movie featuring Tovino Thomas, which explores the theme of identity and its complexities. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver on its promise, becoming a drag that's difficult to digest.A Confusing and Meandering PlotThe movie follows a young man, played by Tovino Thomas, who is struggling to find his place in the world. As he navigates his relationships and career, he begins to question his own identity and sense of self. However, the plot is convoluted and meandering, making it difficult to follow and become invested in the character's journey.The film's attempts to explore the complexities of identity are admirable, but they are ultimately undermined by the weak narrative and character development. The pacing is slow and plodding, with long stretches of boring exposition that fail to add any real depth to the story.A Misguided Exploration of IdentityThe movie's portrayal of identity is overly simplistic and lacks nuance. The film suggests that identity is something that can be easily discovered or changed, but it fails to explore the complexities and challenges that come with finding one's sense of self.Furthermore, the film's themes of identity and self-discovery are not fully developed, leaving the audience with a sense of confusion and disconnection. The movie's message is unclear and ambiguous, making it difficult to understand what the filmmakers are trying to say.A Weak and Underdeveloped CastThe cast of \"Identity\" is equally disappointing. Tovino Thomas, who is known for his versatility and range, is wasted in a underdeveloped and one-dimensional role. The supporting cast is equally weak, with characters that feel more like caricatures than fully fleshed-out people.A Recommendation to AvoidOverall, I would not recommend \"Identity\" to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and engaging movie experience. The film's convoluted plot, misguided exploration of identity, and weak cast make it a chore to watch.If you're looking for a movie that explores the complexities of identity and self-discovery, I would suggest looking elsewhere. There are many better films that tackle these themes in a more nuanced and thought-provoking way.\"Identity\" is a disappointing and misguided attempt at exploring complex themes. With a convoluted plot, weak cast, and misguided concept, this movie is best avoided.",

        "content": "I genuinely don't understand the high ratings for this film. It is overrated, filled with absurd improbabilities, and ultimately a letdown. Despite boasting a star-studded cast-including Trisha, Vinay Rai, Tovino Thomas, and even Mandira Bedi (whose presence feels almost unnecessary)-the film fails to deliver a compelling narrative.The plot revolves around clich√©d tropes like blackmail and scandal, themes that have been done to death in cinema. The filmmakers seem desperate to appear clever, excessively weaving the concept of \"identity\" into every possible scene. However, instead of adding depth, this overuse feels forced and unoriginal. Even calling it an average thriller would be an overstatement.The storytelling is dull, lagging, and unbearably boring, dragging its feet through scenes that feel more like a forced exposition dump than a gripping narrative. Instead of allowing the story to unfold naturally, the film spoon-feeds every detail, stripping it of any intrigue or suspense. The pacing is inconsistent, often meandering through pointless sequences that add nothing to the plot.Now, let's talk about the performances. This is a major disappointment for Tovino Thomas-it's easily his weakest performance to date. His portrayal of an OCD-afflicted character is utterly gimmicky, lacking depth and authenticity. His dialogue delivery feels forced, unnatural, and devoid of conviction-almost as if he's constipated-making his performance difficult to watch. Shammi Thilakan overacts to the point of trying too hard to showcase his abilities. Trisha wears the same expression throughout the film, which, unfortunately, is nothing new.All that said, Vinay Rai, Vishak Nair, and Archana Kavi and Gopika Ramesh (who play Tovino's sisters) deliver decent performances, bringing some much-needed sincerity to their roles.As for the screenplay, it's an absolute mess-clumsy, confusing, and overloaded with elements that the writers likely thought would add layers of intelligence but instead turn the film into an unintentional joke. The dialogues are pretentious, trying too hard to sound profound while lacking any real substance.In short, this movie is a joke of a joke. It's so unintentionally funny that you can't help but laugh at how poor it is. Even as I attempt to recall specific scenes while writing this review, I find myself cringing at the sheer absurdity of it all. A truly pathetic attempt at a thriller.",

        "content": "By the end, the main question Identity provokes is a simple \"Why did it need ALL of this?\" I'm not joking when I say this could have likely been recut into two separate films - perhaps not even as part 1/part 2, but as two films separate from each other, with the cast playing differently-named characters, as was already done by a few directors earlier.As it is, it does contain a lot of twists - and our understanding of key characters changes so much that their initial actions at times seem to make little sense in hindsight. After a halfway point, genuinely cool and seemingly pivotal scenes (i.e. One where a key character's inability to recognize faces is exploited in a genuinely disturbing manner) also stop mattering like 10 minutes later - in a film which lasts 2.5 hours.I should also note that while I liked the soundtrack quite a lot, the near-obligatory song montage is not integrated as well as was done in a few others I saw recently (most notably Premalu and even arguably Khel Khel Mein) and there's at times a tendency to pick overly charged music for moments that would have benefited from something subtler.And yet...on its own, almost every scene has something to recommend it. Even the final showdown is brought down by simply feeling NOT NECESSARY (in part because the villain could have apparently been easily caught without it anyway) - on a technical level, it is no worse than the final fights in Villeneuve's Dune (either part) or Kill. This doesn't apply to just the action scenes either; for one, a quiet scene where the protagonist remarks that one's choice of music reveals as much as a choice in food is a nice thought - and something most action directors would have never thought of including. As is common in Malayalam cinema, there is the \"social responsibility\" subtext, and the \"rape revenge\" aspects of the story are paired with reassurances that survivors can recover and go on to achieve great things - though whether the creators did enough to justify the use of that plotline in the first place is an open question.In all, this is a weird film to rate. I feel like my current score could easily swing several points in either direction - depending purely on which parts of its massive canvas I would choose to zoom in.",

Now, I'm glad I didn't spend money on it.A suspense thriller where police officers hunt down a twisted criminal with the help of a lone eyewitness and a sketch artist. With many twists in the tale, there's much more to the crime than meets the eye. But will they nab the real culprit?Suspense dramas make for a riveting watch, but there's a thin line between maintaining suspense and creating confusion. This film blurs that line, leaving you scratching your head in confusion and disconnecting you from the main plot. With excessive name-dropping and disjointed incidents, it becomes a mess. It takes almost half the movie to make sense of it all. The screenplay is haphazardly written, making you restless and even bored at times.Tovino Thomas brings his A-game, only to be let down by weak writing. Vinay Rai gets a meatier role and does a good job. Trisha Krishnan's appearance in a Malayalam film created hype, but this is one of the worst choices she could have made-her role is poorly written, with no screen time or substance to perform. In their limited scope, Archana Kavi, Aju Varghese, Shammi Thilakan, and others are decent.The BGM works in the movie's favor, creating a sense of eagerness. However, the suspense isn't something that will leave you shocked-it's predictable, and you can guess some twists from a distance. Logic also takes a backseat at many junctures. Tovino's backstory makes no sense, and many developments in the movie seem to exist just for the sake of it. Midway, everything seems resolved, yet the movie starts again with a new plot, testing your patience.At 150 minutes, this below-average film could have been improved significantly by trimming the last 30 minutes for a better impact. With such a good cast and a promising premise, this is a missed opportunity. Watch it for the leads or your love for the genre-otherwise, there's not much else.#PranuReviews #Identity #IdentityReview.",

        "content": "Identity (2025) :\nBrief Review -Tovino Thomas's Action-Thriller Keeps You On The Edge Of Your Seat. Akhil Paul and Anas Khan direct Tovino Thomas's action thriller, Identity, which suffers from an identity crisis in its structure but has enough edge-of-seat thriller value to keep you hooked for two and a half hours. The film starts off as a racket involving sex clips before shifting its direction toward a mainstream crime drama. It then transitions into a thrilling operation by government officials but loses momentum and freshness as it progresses. For instance, having a girl with a photographic memory and a man with excellent sketch artist skills to find a murderer does sound interesting. However, there are too many twists and characters surrounding this interesting plot, which leaves it feeling scattered and entertaining only in parts. Tovino Thomas plays a sketch artist, a macho hero, and a brother, only to reveal that he is an undercover sky marshal officer. As the female villain states, no one knows the identity of an undercover agent, so how did she obtain this information? From an MMS racket to personal revenge and then to an official mission, we travel a lot, which can become tiresome. Nevertheless, the narrative remains engaging throughout the two and a half hours. A few songs could have been excluded; the opening portion in the second half falls flat, and the climax fight is strictly ordinary. Aside from these flaws, I don't think there is anything significantly wrong with this film, especially if you are a fan of this genre. Tovino's performance and heroic presence were good; Trisha was ordinary; Vinay Rai was annoying; Aju Varghese was decent; Mandira Bedi was hardly visible; and the rest of the cast was average. The screenplay is gripping enough, even though some elements didn't fit well. The cinematography and action scenes are appealing, and the editing is adequate. Paul and Khan's direction was steady, despite overly generated twists, but there wasn't anything illogical. Overall, it's an engaging and watchable action thriller from Malayalam cinema, though not particularly outstanding. One-time watch, for sure.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",

The narrative unfolds in a way that makes it easy to guess the next steps, reducing the suspense factor. It tries to be complex, but instead becomes confusing and predictable at the same time.Overall, Identity is a one-time watch if you have nothing else on your wishlist. It has solid performances and good visuals, but the storyline could have been much tighter and more engaging.",

I think with such immense content, they could have made another two or three movies. The slow-paced narration was fine until the second -half, and the rhythm could have been maintained in the 2nd half, but that didn't happen, and I felt the 2nd-half too lagging.The casting side was okay and as the lead actor- Tovino has done well. Trisha has also performed fine in her respective roles. The supporting role of Shammi Thilakan was humorous, and for some reason, it reminded me of his character in 'Palthu Janwar'.",

Amar is killed and body burnt at the abandoned warehouse, where he used to commit his crimes. Days later, police officer Allen Jacob (Vinay Rai) brings Alisha (Trisha Krishnan) under witness protection program to his apartment and she is a key witness to the murder of Amar Felix. Haran Shankar (Tovino Thomas) also lives in the same building with his sisters and he is also a terrific sketch artist, a talent he got from his mother. He tries to help out but Alisha is suffering from face blindness which makes it tricky. As Haran Shankar successfully sketches the suspect's image, the conspiracy deepens and the case doesn't remain about Amar Felix. How does Haran get to the bottom of the conspiracy and solve it, forms rest of the story.Identity had a decent premise which it doesn't utilize. The whole segment involving Trisha's face blindness is rather treated badly and it doesn't yield any results. Infact the diagnosis itself is so randomly done, her condition doesn't cause any major hindrance and even in the climax, her character conveniently overcomes it. The screenplay was one that of convenience which significantly impacted the proceedings. There was no tense moments and the hero became way too invincible. Rather than sticking to one murder mystery where the killer is revealed early on, the larger conspiracy lacked the elements to thrill me as a viewer. Identity ended up as a forgettable venture which is too ambitious without any solid screenplay.",

These are the reasons I will give it a 6 atleast.The bad - Convoluted story line that pulls out a twist every minute out of nowhere, especially in the second half. Seriously, the story goes all over the place as soon as the second half starts. The dialogues aren't good for most of the movie except for some of Shammi Thilakan's. I was especially laughing at the dialogues in Aju's death scene and the way Tovino's sister says \"Sudarshan\". There was also a funny scene where Trisha doesn't realize who Rajnikanth is and the music becomes really serious for some reason. Tovino having OCD goes nowhere and feels completely unnecessary. Trisha feels unnecessary and there was no point in having her character. Both Major Ravi and Aju have some stupid dialogues that doesn't make much sense. The way the film deals with some sensitive topics feels haphazard. Overall, the film is a mess and I was exhausted by the amount of plot twists near the end. It felt like they were trying to copy the structure of a Nolan film, and they have failed in that.",

        "content": "Identity Movie Review: Too many twists.Story: Haran Shankar is roped in by the police to make a sketch of a suspected murderer, but the portrait he creates adds to the complications of the caseReview: There are movies, such as masala entertainers, which you can best enjoy if, like they say, you leave your brains at the door. Identity, on the other hand, needs you to keep your mental faculties sharp at all times, so that you don't miss the complicated twists that keep coming at you.Tovino plays Haran Shankar, a multi-talented eccentric introvert, who is roped in to help as a sketch artist in a case being investigated by Karnataka police CI Allen Joseph, played by Vinay Rai. Trisha essays Alisha, the witness to a murder, who guides Haran to make the sketch of the suspected murderer. But when he makes the sketch, we are in for a surprise.Tovino carries off the quirks of his character very well and it's one of those roles in which you can't really envision anyone else. Vinay Rai brings style and more to his role. Trisha, Aju Varghese and Vishak Nair play their roles well, but it is a bit disappointing to see a talent like Arjun Radhakrishnan reduced to a very minor part.A pat on the back for stunt director Yannick Ben, whose earlier credits include Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan and OTT series The Family Man, for the climax action sequence on a flight, that is noteworthy with a woman as one of the contract fighters. She carries it off amazingly well and it is refreshing and a relief that at no point is her gender used for comedic value; an equal-opportunities fight.The basic premise regarding identity and the core crime are interesting and could have made for a unique and interesting revenge thriller. The initial twists are pretty awesome, but the writer-directors Akhil Paul and Anas Khan, who earlier made Forensic, aim to create so many stylish, OTT (meaning, over the top) twists that it gets difficult to identify with the characters and there is a disconnect, which is the main failing of the film. And you are constantly wondering how anyone could write up and then direct a complicated story like this. It's a pity, because largely, it is well-made with perfectly coordinated cinematography by Akhil George and cuts by Chaman Chakko.",

Here maybe it's not the cooks themselves but the elements that went into this movie.The movie feels more like a pitch rather than an actual offering. It's almost like a focus group setup to offer it's subjects (us the audience) with a group of movie plots to gauge their pick of the offerings and then pick that for the next movie.There are so many parallel things happening which together fail to sync together or offer any momentum to the core plot, whatever that is.Watching this movie is like watching reels or shorts. The users history means the shorts are based on their preferences and somehow loosely tied together but each has it's own existence. The movie has so many sub plots which are barely connected or relevant to the big picture but somehow there is a mishmash which makes no sense whatsoever and it does no favors to the overall execution.There is a lot of energy in trying to build up Tovino's character but then the final presentation is a far cry from what the build up built up to be. It's almost like someone put up the rejected ideas into the deck and so the final pitch is something in a different universe.There are characters who are more like the ingredients in the kitchen of a cooking show, which were shot for aesthetics but are not a part of the recipe. Almost like I had a bucket list of actors who I wanted in my movie but my script had no actual place for them so I just fit them in and spent a few minutes trying to give them some semblance of connection to the plot.The movie has it's moments and the climax does offer some twists and turns which is the only saving grace. Vinay Rai does his transition really well and while there are plot holes, he is still a menacing presence and classy at the same time. Not much to be mentioned more about Tovino and Trisha who were absolutely wasted. So many other characters also added with an intent to provide color but end up being distractions.All said and done, if you have nothing particularly interesting in your watch list, try this but I would recommend you start somewhere with maybe 40 minutes left to the end.",

How does Ram become the hurdle to the greedy sons and save the state from corruption, forms rest of the story. It's a Shankar film so a flashback exists as well.Let me be honest, if this film had released 25 years ago, then it might have been something else and the songs would definitely been better with AR Rahman. 25 years later, Shankar is out of form, trying his old tricks yet the outcome isn't enough to make is comeback. Only consolation is that it is not as worse as Indian 2. Probably the first Shankar film where the flashback didn't work except for the telephone bit. The idea is decent and the film has it's high moments but none of it takes the film to another level. It was all too routine and I wish Shankar had put in more efforts into the screenplay than making it visually grand. The usual Shankar gimmicks ran out of steam and so did SJ Suryah's regular villain act, leaving Ram Charan to pull the film to the finish line. With heavy heart, I will say that Shankar must take a break and then make a worthy comeback. Cannot see him ruining his own legacy like this.",

The second half starts on superb note with a 20 minute flashback that reminds us of Vintage Shankar. However, after this portion, it again turns back into a run of the mill political movie that turns melodramatic and tiring towards the end.The film uses similar tropes to many political movies in the past which gives it an outdated and tiring feel at times. The heart and soul of the film is a 20 minute flashback. RC is absolutely superb as Appana in this flash back and will remain as another feather in his cap. The rest of RCs character is a regular IAS role that is a cakewalk for him. Thaman's music is an asset for the film whenever it doesn't enter the overly loud mode. The production values are good especially in the songs.This is easily better than Indian 2, however, it can't be considered as a comeback for Shankar as his writing and taking is below par and is completely carried by the music and Charan.

        "content": "Just watched \"Game Changer\" and thought it was better than \"Indian 2\". The movie has some predictable moments, but the first half's writing and the 20-minute flashback in the second half are noteworthy. However, some viewers might find the screenplay and editing weak, and the sound mix stale. Despite this, it's a clean family-friendly film.Ram Charan's performance is impressive, and his character, Appanna, is a highlight. His screen presence is undeniable. The cat-and-mouse chase between Ram Charan and Surya will entertain audiences.The movie showcases the power of an IAS officer and a Chief Electoral Officer, highlighting the challenges of doing good for society. However, few audience may don't feel good about movie.Why? Few individuals may think that i am already aware that I'll be taken advantage of by politicians. I know law & order gonna deceive me, it's no surprise. I'm well aware they will cheat me every term. But you/director/artists do not try to tell me that I could be cheated by them - I can't bear it\"that's the reason few may don't feel good about movie because director attempted to cram the entire constitution and its rights into a 2.5-hour film, which may overwhelm audiences, feeling like they're being hit with a dense, heavy book.Overall, \"Game Changer\" is a decent watch, but its impact may vary depending on individual perspectives.",

Editing by Ruben and Shameer was fine.Coming to Shankar, man, it's frustrating and gut-wrenching to see his standards going down, he redefined the commercial genre, but here, despite political thriller being his strong suite, the writing and direction, both were below average.BOTTOMLINE : Comeback Shankar wait continues.......",

Despite the single narrative of resilience, the movie evokes compassion and fuses in an adequate amount of sincerity to ensure an engaging approach towards the audience, which works in its favor. You can clearly see how elite competition takes a toll on someone through how the film accurately portrays the psychological and emotional repercussions of the said. Everything from the complexities within a family regarding relationships, and strong bonds between teammates is unfiltered and shown in an honest manner throughout the movie.This movie does a remarkable job when it comes to performance. The character's arc, highlights moments of victory and internal catastrophes, which is a difficult thing to balance, but the lead actor manages to exhibit the character perfectly.

The small yet clever twists scattered across the plot keep the momentum alive, making it a treat for viewers who love gripping narratives.The song picturization is vibrant, and the \"Dhop\" song dance deserves a special mention for its infectious energy. The background score is above average, complementing the high-stakes drama well. What's even better is that this is a movie you can enjoy with your family-something rare these days.A standout performance comes from SJ Suryah, whose acting adds depth and intensity to the movie. Ram Charan delivers yet another brilliant performance, proving his versatility. Sunil, after a long gap, brings back his charm and provides much-needed comedic relief that genuinely works. The rest of the cast shines in their respective roles, contributing to the overall experience.While it's tempting to compare this film to big-ticket blockbusters like RRR, Baahubali, or Pushpa: The Rise, I'd advise against it. This movie has its own unique flavor and stands tall as an entertaining, well-executed project.

Known for his captivating performances, magnetic screen presence, and ability to adapt to diverse roles, Ram Charan's career is a testament to his relentless pursuit of excellence. Over the years, he has redefined himself and Indian cinema with groundbreaking projects, pushing the boundaries of storytelling, action, and emotion.Early Beginnings and Legacy\nBorn into the illustrious Konidela family, Ram Charan is the son of legendary Telugu actor Chiranjeevi. Despite the weight of this legacy, he has successfully carved a path uniquely his own. From his debut film, Chirutha (2007), to his meteoric rise in the industry, Ram Charan showcased immense potential as an actor who could effortlessly blend style and substance.His second film, Magadheera (2009), directed by S. S. Rajamouli, was a landmark in Telugu cinema. The reincarnation drama became a massive success, breaking records and establishing Ram Charan as a force to reckon with. His portrayal of Harsha and Kala Bhairava was nothing short of spectacular, blending heroism, romance, and intensity. This performance proved that Ram Charan was not just a star but a performer with immense range and dedication.Becoming the Game Changer\nWhile Ram Charan enjoyed commercial success in the early stages of his career, his evolution as a \"game changer\" began with his choice of unconventional roles and his willingness to experiment. Films like Dhruva (2016) showcased his ability to delve into complex characters, playing an intelligent and morally driven police officer. This movie was a refreshing departure from the usual formulaic storytelling, cementing his place as an actor capable of carrying intense, narrative-driven films.Another milestone in his career was Rangasthalam (2018), directed by Sukumar. Set in a rural backdrop, this film was a gritty tale of revenge and resilience. Ram Charan's portrayal of Chitti Babu, a hearing-impaired villager, was a revelation. His raw, earthy performance struck a chord with audiences and critics alike, earning him several awards and accolades. The movie became a massive commercial success, reaffirming his versatility and commitment to authenticity in his roles.RRR: A Global Phenomenon\nThe pinnacle of Ram Charan's career came with RRR (2022), directed by S. S. Rajamouli. This magnum opus redefined Indian cinema on a global scale. Ram Charan played the role of Alluri Sitarama Raju, a revolutionary freedom fighter, opposite Jr. NTR's Komaram Bheem. The film's grandeur, gripping narrative, and spectacular performances made it a worldwide phenomenon.Ram Charan's performance in RRR was a masterclass in intensity and emotional depth. His transformation into a disciplined, resilient warrior was both physically and emotionally demanding. The action sequences, combined with the heart-wrenching moments of sacrifice and camaraderie, showcased his unparalleled dedication to his craft. The film not only earned critical acclaim but also achieved international recognition, including a historic Oscar win for the song Naatu Naatu.Impact Beyond Cinema\nRam Charan's influence extends beyond his on-screen presence. As a producer, he has backed meaningful projects through his production house, Konidela Production Company, further contributing to the growth of Indian cinema. His humility, philanthropy, and connection with fans have also made him a beloved figure off-screen.Future Prospects\nRam Charan continues to be a trailblazer in the industry, with exciting projects lined up that promise to push cinematic boundaries further. His ability to adapt, innovate, and stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry ensures that he remains a \"game changer\" for years to come.In conclusion, Ram Charan is more than just a superstar; he is a transformative figure who has elevated Indian cinema on multiple levels. Through his exceptional performances, bold choices, and relentless drive, he has proven that he is not just following a legacy but creating one of his own. As audiences eagerly await his next cinematic endeavor, one thing is certain: Ram Charan's journey is far from over, and the game is still his to change.overall blend of experience and culture and high octane movie.",

        "title": "Shankar's Game Changer: A Promising Start, But Falls Short in the Second Half",
        "content": "Shankar is undeniably a legendary director. He was a pioneer in creating pan-Indian films long before the term became popular. Not only did he helm high-budget movies with big stars, but with films like Boys and Premikudu, he proved he could deliver blockbusters even without major star power. Unfortunately, that golden era seems to have faded. Especially after the controversies surrounding Indian 2, his reputation has taken a hit. Naturally, when he announced Game Changer, skepticism was high. Many wondered if he could recreate his old magic. However, with Ram Charan, Chiranjeevi, and Dil Raju onboard-each a heavyweight in their own right-it wasn't just Shankar's movie anymore. Even so, the negative sentiment surrounding the project seemed to impact its opening.After watching the movie, I can see why Ram Charan and the others believed in its potential. Appanna's character is a standout and might just be one of the most memorable roles in Ram Charan's career. Years down the line, when he reflects on his filmography, this will likely be one of the highlights. The character even reminded me of The King's Speech-perhaps it served as an inspiration.The first half of the film is engaging, barring the introduction song after the initial fight, which felt routine. Beyond that, the first half works well, capped off by an unpredictable interval twist. There are also some dialogues explaining the role and powers of a district collector, and Burra Sai Madhav's writing truly shines here. It's reminiscent of that iconic scene in Rakhi where NTR passionately explains the importance of Indian Railways. Post-interval, the flashback sequence of Appanna's character is a major highlight. This is where vintage Shankar resurfaces, and Ram Charan delivers a stellar performance.However, after this flashback, the second half becomes somewhat predictable. The political drama echoes Tamil Nadu's election dynamics, drawing parallels to the DMK and Anna DMK parties. Unfortunately, the writing falters here, lacking the freshness or impact of the first half. I suspect many viewers might find the latter portion underwhelming.In terms of performances, Ram Charan gets plenty of scope to explore various shades, and he does a commendable job. Personally, I preferred his look with a beard-it suits him better. Surya performs well but veers into overacting in a few scenes. It was refreshing to see Srikanth in this role, and he did justice to it. The heroine, sadly, doesn't get much screen time or substance, while the rest of the cast delivered solid performances. Thaman's music is a notable positive, offering some refreshing compositions that enhance the film in many parts.Overall, Game Changer is worth watching for its strong first half and the flashback episodes. However, the routine and predictable second half may dampen its box-office prospects.",

Ram Charan as Appanna deserved more screen time, as the flashback scenes added no depth to the story and felt too rushed.**First Half vs. Second Half**\nWhile the interval and pre-interval sequences were exceptional, they raised expectations for the second half, which turned out to have several dull moments.",

        "content": "When I said Shankar lost his touch in my Indian 2 review, I also mentioned that he is going to mess up Game Changer as well because he shot both the films simultaneously. And as expected, he did mess up. Badly. Although I must say that this is not as bad as Indian 2, but the bar is so low here that it is easy to pass it. Let's get into the details.Game Changer follows the same formula that all Shankar's movies follow. A man trying to set the society along the right path by fighting injustice. We are introduced to Ram (Ram Charan) who is an IAS officer with anger management issues. He was previously an IPS officer with anger management issues. This entire setup is a series of cringe inducing sequences with Ram and Kiara Advani who plays Ram's love interest. The reason Ram becomes an IAS office is equally cringe. Kiara advises Ram to channel his anger to the good of the society and tells him to become an IAS office. But Ram wants to become an IPS officer. She also warns him that she'd not talk with him if he becomes an IPS officer as IPS, somehow, means anger? Anyway, Ram becomes an IPS officer and they breakup. So Ram studies again and becomes an IAS officer. If you are scratching you head at this point, then I must warn you this entire cringe fest takes up all of Act 1 for over 40 minutes without ever introducing us to a conflict. That is how bad Shankar's writing is.When the conflict does arrive, it is a lame reason that creates a rift between Ram, the IAS, and Mopi Devi, played by SJ Suryah, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh state. What's a Shankar's movie without a flashback? There is an elaborate flashback that takes up all of Act 2 where we are introduced to Appanna (Ram Charan, again. Duh!) and his fight for justice and how he gets betrayed by his own friends. How Ram finds out the truth and defeats Mopi Devi form the rest of Act 3 or what is left of it.Now, I don't have a problem with these generic saviour templates. They were fine some 20 years ago. They may have a place even now. However, the way Shankar executed this story with his insipid screenplay and character development is what ruined it for me. Up until Robo in 2010, Shankar made movies that were ahead of their time and in 2025 he is making movies that would have been blockbusters in the 90s. He is the Benjamin Button of filmmakers, except for the worse. He is not updated with kinds of stories that audience expect to watch on the big screen, especially after the pandemic. He is not updated on the latest trends in filmmaking. He is still in his mindset where he spends lavishly on a song to make it rich and colorful.After watching Indian 2 and Game Changer, I cannot help but think whether Shankar has always been a hack. Did he use the grandeur and lavishness to coverup his lack of skill in filmmaking? Only he knows. But for the rest of us, Game Changer can be skipped completely. Hope you liked this review.-YT/@CinephileIndia2023.",

        "content": "While this isn't as terrible as Indian 2 overall, the entirety of the first hour is some of the worst bits of filmmaking I have seen from the once-iconic director. The comedy sucks (Sunil and Vennela Kishore characters desperately need the \"DELETE\" button), the intro fight & song combo is horrendous, the romance between Charan and Kiara's characters is so poorly written, and SJ Suryah does eccentric SJ Suryah for the millionth time. Yeah, I should stop looking at this as a Tamil film, because it clearly isn't aiming to be one.Almost every song is a bathroom break, though I like some of the beats in Dhop (along with its vibrant picturization). It was difficult to connect with the protagonist - an IAS officer + IPS officer + Election Officer + Angry Dude in College + whatever the hell the writing needs him to be. We connected with Shankar's protagonists in some of his earlier films because most of them weren't default superheroes. Very often, the circumstance creates one, and that formula worked for him for nearly 2 decades. But gone are those days. I'm not sure what ideas Karthik Subbaraj fed Shankar in the initial stages-ultimately, Shankar chose to give it the same screenplay treatment as Mudhalvan, Sivaji, and the likes.. in 2025. Plus, the only time I bought the performer in Ram Charan was during the short flashback portion, and even that's less impactful.Kiara Advani is drop-dead gorgeous, though she's mostly relegated to being a song-and-dance prop in the film. Anjali gets a meatier presence than expected, and is fine in the flashback (..not the present). Jayaram is disposable, and Srikanth plays the guy Samuthirakani or Sachin Khedekar usually takes up. My biggest gripe, however, is with the action sequences. I don't remember Shankar directing action this terribly, like EVER. Peter Hein and Anbariv are involved, but to what avail? Every set piece is wholly forgettable. The \"Hari-fication\" of Shankar is well and truly underway, as far as the pacing is concerned. I don't have any faith in his upcoming projects. God save the Velpari adaptation.",

        "content": "\"Game Changer\" (2025) arrives with the weight of expectations that come with a Shankar-Ram Charan collaboration. While the film delivers on the promise of visual grandeur and a charismatic performance from its leading man, it ultimately falls short of being a truly impactful cinematic experience due to a weak second half and a predictable storyline.Ram Charan is undoubtedly the film's biggest strength. He delivers a powerhouse performance, showcasing his versatility and charisma in dual roles. His screen presence is electrifying, and he carries the film with his energy and conviction.The film's first half is engaging, with Shankar's signature style on full display. The visuals are grand, the action sequences are stylish, and the songs are picturized with a lavishness that is characteristic of the director. However, the narrative loses its grip in the second half, with the plot becoming predictable and the writing losing its sharpness.The film's attempts at social commentary, while well-intentioned, feel heavy-handed and lack the subtlety needed to truly resonate. The romantic track feels forced and unnecessary, disrupting the flow of the narrative. The climax, while visually impressive, lacks the emotional impact and punch that one expects from a Shankar film.Despite its flaws, \"Game Changer\" is a watchable film, primarily due to Ram Charan's stellar performance and the film's visual grandeur. However, its weak second half, predictable plot, and lackluster writing prevent it from being a truly memorable or impactful cinematic experience.",

        "content": "A film comes along once in a while, capturing the hearts of the viewers but at the same time breaking all the norms to leave a permanent mark on the art of filmmaking. Game Changer is one of them. It is a film with a gripping narrative, with great visuals and performances that leave one emotionally drained. It's not just a film; it's an experience, a rollercoaster of emotions and ideas, long after the credits roll.A Story That Resonates Deeply\nThe plot of Game Changer is a masterstroke of storytelling.

I wouldn't watch it again.\"You said:\nIn 600 words mkre\nChatGPT said:\nChatGPT\nHere's a more detailed version of a bad review for a movie:\"The movie was an enormous letdown in nearly every aspect. It started with promise, but the plot quickly descended into a predictable and uninspired mess that lacked any real sense of intrigue or originality. The storyline felt recycled, like a poorly constructed amalgamation of better films, and failed to offer anything new to engage the audience.The pacing was another major issue. The first act dragged on far too long, taking an eternity to establish basic details about the characters and their motivations. By the time the central conflict was introduced, I had already lost interest. The middle portion of the film felt like it was just killing time, with drawn-out scenes and unnecessary subplots that added nothing to the story. The climax, which should have been the film's highlight, fell flat due to its rushed execution and lack of emotional buildup.The characters were equally disappointing. Despite the talented cast, the performances felt lackluster, as though the actors themselves were disengaged from the material. The protagonist was underdeveloped, and their motivations were either unclear or shallow. The supporting cast was given little to work with, often reduced to stereotypical roles that bordered on being offensive. There was no real chemistry between the characters, making their interactions feel forced and unconvincing.The dialogue deserves a special mention for being some of the most stilted and unnatural I've heard in recent memory. It alternated between cringe-worthy attempts at humor that fell flat and overly dramatic monologues that felt out of place. At times, it seemed as though the scriptwriters were more interested in inserting catchy one-liners for the trailer than crafting believable conversations.",

Directed by a visionary filmmaker and led by an incredible cast, this movie has left a significant impact on the audience and critics alike. Here's why Game Changer is being hailed as one of the finest cinematic experiences in recent years.First and foremost, the film's storyline is fresh and innovative. It revolves around a protagonist who challenges the status quo in a powerful and thought-provoking manner. Unlike the typical formulaic plots we see in mainstream cinema, Game Changer delves deep into issues of social justice, morality, and personal transformation. The narrative doesn't shy away from taking risks, and that's one of its biggest strengths. The film's pacing ensures that there's never a dull moment, keeping viewers glued to their seats from start to finish. The plot twists and turns are executed brilliantly, adding layers of complexity to an already intriguing story.A major highlight of the movie is its performances. The lead actor, who portrays a character going through profound internal and external changes, delivers a career-defining performance. His portrayal is both raw and intense, making it impossible to take your eyes off him. The character's journey from an ordinary individual to a revolutionary figure is handled with such depth and nuance that it resonates with audiences on a personal level. Equally commendable are the supporting cast members, who provide stellar performances that complement the protagonist's journey. Each character feels real, with their own motivations and backstories, making them relatable an.",

Spoiler alert: I couldn't make it to the end.Why, oh why, must they add songs every five minutes for no apparent reason? Did someone lose a bet? One moment, the protagonist is in a heated confrontation; the next, he's breakdancing in the rain. I felt like I'd accidentally walked into a karaoke contest.And the protagonist... where do I begin? He's so ridiculously overpowered that he single-handedly demolishes an entire mall in seconds while the spectators applaud. Yes, you read that right-people clap as their favorite shopping destination crumbles into rubble. Maybe they hated the mall too?Honestly, this movie is not just a waste of time; it's a waste of good popcorn. Save yourself the misery and avoid this cinematic catastrophe. Or watch it if you're in the mood for some unintentional comedy. As for me, I left halfway, which is the best decision I made that day.What do you think of this version?",

        "content": "Super.\"Game Changer,\" directed by S. Shankar and released on January 10, 2025, is a Telugu-language political action film that delves into the complexities of corruption and governance in contemporary India. The film features Ram Charan in a dual role, supported by a talented ensemble cast including Kiara Advani, Anjali, and S. J. Suryah.The narrative centers on Ram Nandan, an upright district magistrate who confronts the entrenched corruption perpetuated by the powerful Bobbili political dynasty. Ram's commitment to enforcing the law and his strategic acumen position him as a formidable adversary to the corrupt minister Bobbili Mopidevi, portrayed with intensity by S. J. Suryah. The film's plot is further enriched by a flashback that reveals the origins of the political outfit, highlighting how noble intentions can be derailed by ambition and moral compromise.Ram Charan delivers a compelling performance, effectively embodying the dual aspects of his character's righteous indignation and strategic brilliance. His portrayal is complemented by Kiara Advani's role as Deepika, though their romantic subplot serves more as a vehicle for elaborate musical sequences than as a substantive narrative arc. Anjali's performance adds depth to the storyline, while S. J. Suryah's depiction of Mopidevi provides a nuanced antagonist whose interactions with Ram Nandan are among the film's highlights.Shankar's direction is evident in the film's grandiose set pieces and elaborate action sequences. However, while the film aspires to blend mass entertainment with a socially relevant message, it occasionally falters in maintaining narrative cohesion and emotional depth. The pacing is uneven, with certain segments feeling rushed, thereby diminishing the potential impact of pivotal scenes. The flashback sequences, intended to provide context and emotional weight, lack the resonance found in some of Shankar's earlier works, resulting in a less compelling backstory.The film's production design and cinematography are noteworthy, with Tirru's visual composition capturing both the opulence of political power and the grit of grassroots activism. Thaman S's musical score complements the film's tone, though some song placements disrupt the narrative flow. The action choreography is executed with precision, aligning with the film's thematic emphasis on systemic reform through lawful means.\"Game Changer\" has elicited a spectrum of critical responses. Rachit Gupta of Filmfare commends it as \"an unmistakable Shankar creation fueled and delivered with Ram Charan's charisma,\" awarding it 3.5 out of 5 stars. Conversely, Sudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express critiques the film for its lack of emotional resonance and uneven execution, rating it 2.5 out of 5. Such divergent perspectives underscore the film's ambition to tackle significant themes, even if its execution does not consistently achieve the intended impact.In summary, \"Game Changer\" is a film that ambitiously addresses the pervasive issue of political corruption through the lens of a mass entertainer. While it succeeds in certain areas, particularly in performances and technical execution, it falls short in delivering a consistently engaging and emotionally resonant narrative. Nevertheless, for audiences interested in political dramas with a blend of action and social commentary, \"Game Changer\" offers a viewing experience that, despite its imperfections, stimulates reflection on the dynamics of power and governance.",

The choreography is on point, the songs are catchy, and each actor gave their best performance. It's rare to find a movie that's both informative and entertaining, but Game Changer does exactly that. It's a movie that not only entertains but also educates, offering a much-needed narrative for the public. Definitely a must-watch for everyone!",

The film is directed by James Bamford, himself a former stuntman and stunt coordinator.The anime style opening credits really riffs on West's nickname as The Samurider. She plays the titled character Jade whose afro wig is bigger than her waist.Jade sports a cockney accent and is abducted by some goons sent by gangster Tork (Mickey Rourke.) He wants a hard drive and has already killed Jade's brother.She will be next but Jade manages to escape after a Brad Pitt lookalike gets careless.The story is a third rate low budget Robert Rodriguez/Tarantino noirish Sin City type of action thriller, with some cartoonish humour.It benefits from plenty of action scenes. Unfortunately some of them are badly staged with too many gimmicks. Why does Jade shoot a baddie repeatedly when she could had sliced him in half with a Samurai sword?The ending makes little sense. It leads to a big boss fight but then leaves the villain intact with some redundant twists.There is scope for more Jade movies but it will need to be better directed.

So I didn't really know what I was in for, nor did I really have any expectations to the movie. And that ultimately meant that director James Bamford had every opportunity to entertain and bedazzle me.However, I am a bit perplexed how it managed for three writers to churn out something as forgettable and bland as \"Jade\" turned out to be. Writers Lynn Colliar, Glenn Ennis and James Bamford collectively managed to put together a script and storyline that left me with an overwhelming sense of 'was that really it?' when the movie came to an end. Throughout the course of the 88 minutes that the movie ran for there weren't really any ups and downs, despite of the writers trying to put together a thrilling storyline.

It was not an entertaining movie, and it is a movie that will never find its way back to my screen a second time.

        "content": "While Jade is the latest martial arts release from Well Go USA, there is a lot of movie homage' here for movie fans, and martial arts movie fans alike. It blends the elements of 1970's Blaxploitan films with modern martial arts action. On some levels Jade is like Foxy Brown (1973) meets Kill Bill (2003). However, I don't think you need to be a film aficionado to enjoy this as an action, martial arts movie experience.While this is a low budget, simply scripted, and simply shot movie I think the result is greater than the sum of the parts. Jade really is a fun time.We start the movie following the accidental death of the main character's brother. The back story, of a young girl whose parents' die, and is introduced into Gang life in an unnamed city starts to unfold and is intertwined throughout the story. We learn, almost collaterally, about Jade and her life and history. As she is coping with her brother's death she becomes entangled in the deadly quest for a hard drive of international significance. While these details are hardly believable, it really doesn't matter. Jade's appeal is not built upon the movie's story; it is built upon its characters and its martial arts action sequences.Shaina West is the titled character, and the heart of the film. She is as deadly as she is sexy. Most of all Jade is really, really cool. She is cool, from the way she dresses, to the way she talks, to the way she throws her hands and feet. She has a strong moral compass and she is skilled in the art of kicking butt-whether with her hands and with a blade. I think if West did not have the screen presence she commands the film could have been received in a very different way. She sells the camp, but she doesn't oversell it. She is fun to watch throughout this one.The martial arts choreography, particularly considering the basic way this film as shot is very good. It is also plentiful. There are numerous fight sequences, and gun battles packed into a 90 minute romp. They are well done.Mickey Rourke has morphed into the quintessential cartoon villain, and that is on full display here. He is perfect for the role.Mark Decascos is a seasoned martial arts action start and stunt man in his own right. He is good but his fighting acumen is completely underutilized in this film. Perhaps, if there are future film installments featuring West's Jade, we will get to see a little of Mark's martial arts prowess.James Bamford does an admirable job as the Director. The film is simply shot. He does a good job making the low budget nature of the film seem like it is part of the retro-cool feel, rather than a consequence of stretching limited dollars.I recommend Jade highly. It does contain violence and is not meant for kids. However I like Jade, both the character and the movie. I hope we get to see more of her in the future.",

Patriotism is unnecessarily forced into the screenplay for commercial appeal.Naga Chaitanya clearly puts in a lot of effort, and his dedication is visible. However, he doesn't quite become the character he's playing. While this might be one of his better performances, he still needs to pick scripts that truly suit his strengths.Sai Pallavi, as always, delivers a solid performance. But here's the thing-she's so consistently good that this role feels like just another day at work for her. Nothing groundbreaking, just her usual excellence.The rest of the cast does their job well-no complaints, but no surprises either.On the technical side, the production values are respectable. The locations, sets, costumes, and makeup all fit the mood of the film. The cinematography is pleasing, and the music adds some flavor, though it doesn't particularly elevate the experience.In the end, the film is neither great nor terrible-it just sits in the safe zone of mediocrity.

However, what unfolded on screen was not just a profound disappointment but a deeply distressing experience that I am compelled to warn others about.Thandel is not only a poorly executed film-it is a reckless affront to human decency. The narrative is marred by an overabundance of flashbacks and unnecessary detours, resulting in a bloated runtime that any competent director could have trimmed to under 110 minutes. Despite my admiration for Sai Pallavi, the character she plays is selfish and unlikable for half of the movie. And even Ms. Pallavi's radiant performance cannot salvage a film that exhibits such blatant disregard for its audience's well-being.And then comes the scene.It is so sickeningly vile that it made my stomach churn and my hands tremble. This particular moment implies an act of unthinkable violence against a child that is both repugnant and utterly unnecessary. The filmmakers' choice to hide the moment of impact does nothing to mitigate its horror; in fact, it leaves the viewer confused and forced to conjure images potentially more disturbing than anything that could have been shown. Including such an act-even the idea-is irresponsible. It isn't storytelling. It's beyond evil. It's beyond sick. I don't think there is a word for it. It sabotages the viewer and carves a wound into their soul.There is an unspoken rule in storytelling: \"Don't kill the dog\". It's not about censorship; it's about human decency. It's a trust that we place in filmmakers to never cross certain lines.Thandel crosses a line in the most repugnant, unnecessary, and unforgivable way I have ever witnessed-even if this violence would have happened to an adult. The implication is stomach-churning, the execution repellent, and worst of all, it serves no purpose other than to shock and scar.Netflix's decision to rate this film as TV-14 is a tragic misjudgment (or maybe they couldn't get through the first half of the movie). The scene in question has no place in an NC-17 film, let alone a movie deemed suitable for teenagers. You can't unsee it. You can't unthink it.Moreover, one must question the ethical considerations of involving a child actor in such a scene. And I can't imagine the parents who, knowing the script, would consent to their child participating in the portrayal of such an unthinkable act?Chandoo Mondeti, with this single decision, has lost me as a viewer forever. A director who crosses such a line once cannot be trusted not to do it again. I will never watch another film he makes, and I urge others to do the same. Many artistic choices can be debated; many mistakes can be forgiven. This is not one of them.Final Verdict: Thandel is not just a bad movie; it is a dangerous one. Protect your family-Protect yourself. Do not watch this film.",

Overall acting of naga chaitanya is very good and improved than previous movies. Sai pallavi also nailed it and her dance too. A very good movie to watch with a storyline in this recent years.

This is a true story which has been dramatised for superior cinematic viewing, however the duration of the movie has lasted longer than necessary with certain repetitive sequences around the emotional scenes thereby diluting the impact of the natural chemistry between the lead actors. It's like making a larger Dosa with the same cup of batter. Must watch but not more than once. DSP's thematic tune is lilting and positively haunting. Casting is excellent. I wish there was a more outdoor shoot, especially on the coastlines, instead of showing the same fishing harbour five times.",

        "content": "Naga Chaitanya has been struggling with a string of flops and desperately needed a solid hit. When he announced Thandel with Geetha Arts, it immediately created a buzz. A film backed by prestigious producers like Allu Aravind and Bunny Vasu is usually a sign that there's something special about it. The film stars Sai Pallavi, who previously acted with Naga Chaitanya in Love Story, a blockbuster. With music by Devi Sri Prasad and direction by Chandoo Mondeti, the film had all the makings of a big success. Plus, the team took over a year to complete it.Adding to the intrigue, Thandel is based on real incidents about Indian fishermen captured by Pakistani soldiers and the struggles they and their families faced before their release.I liked the movie. At first, I wondered why Sai Pallavi always ends up in emotional roles where she has to cry a lot. But as the story progressed, I got invested and felt satisfied by the end. One refreshing aspect was that the lead pair was already deeply in love when the movie began. Most films spend too much time on the hero's journey to win over the heroine, but here, the love story was already established. That allowed the narrative to focus more on what happens after their relationship is tested.Naga Chaitanya and Sai Pallavi are a hit pair. They complement each other with stellar performances. The pre-interval conflict was done exceptionally well-many will relate to it. There's a moment where the female lead refuses to talk to the hero, and no matter what he does, she sticks to her decision. Naga Chaitanya's performance in this sequence is superb, perfectly capturing the frustration and pain of not being able to communicate with his lover. Sai Pallavi, as always, is fantastic.The second half is well-executed, showcasing real political incidents from that time and how they affected the captured fishermen. One aspect I appreciated was the portrayal of the Pakistani jailer. Rather than making him a stereotypical villain, they showed him as a man simply doing his duty while understanding that the fishermen were innocent. It was refreshing to see this nuanced take-despite the India-Pakistan rivalry, regular people on both sides don't necessarily hate each other. Of course, the film does highlight extremists who despise India, adding moments of tension. One particular jail scene was quite uncomfortable to watch. I won't spoil it, but I think it was necessary to add emotional weight.Thandel is a commendable attempt at telling a real-life-inspired story. The background score by Devi Sri Prasad is excellent, especially the signature theme used to showcase the love between the lead pair. Performance-wise, as mentioned earlier, Naga Chaitanya did a great job. With his long hair and beard, he looked like a rustic fisherman and convincingly portrayed a lover deeply in love while also emerging as a leader (Thandel means leader) for his fellow fishermen.I particularly liked one supporting character who wanted to marry Sai Pallavi-his role was well-written. The rest of the cast was good, but some didn't quite fit as fishermen, and their accents felt off. Given that the team took a year to make this film, they could have provided better training to make the accents more authentic. Cinematography and art direction were solid. As for the director, Chandoo Mondeti surprised me. I didn't expect him to handle a love story so well while also delivering strong emotions.Sai Pallavi's role felt tailor-made for her, and she did full justice to it. The opening sequence felt like it was edited to create a hook, but later, the director introduced Sai Pallavi as if we were seeing her for the first time, which felt a bit inconsistent.You should give this film a try.",

Being imprisoned in a enemy country, you can't keep fighting people and get away with it.Multiple times one political party is showcased in good light just to satisfy the powerfull and fool the audience with religious sentiments which directors these days find very easy to sell their movies. Overall, it's disappointing.The only 2 reasons the movie worked in theaters are 1) Religious sentiments 2) Unrealistic eacape from an enemy country.",

        "content": "Thandel Story: Set against the backdrop of Srikakulam's coastal fishing community, Thandel revolves around the love story of Raju (Naga Chaitanya) and Satya (Sai Pallavi), two souls deeply in love. Raju, a fisherman who inherits leadership qualities from his father, becomes the Thandel (leader) among his peers. Despite Satya's apprehensions about the dangers of the sea, Raju embarks on a nine-month fishing expedition with the men from the village. However, fate takes a cruel turn when he and his crew inadvertently drift into Pakistani waters, leading to their capture and imprisonment. What happens to them in a foreign land, and do they ever return to India?Thandel Review: Director Chandoo Mondeti takes a real-life-inspired backdrop and turns Thandel into an intense emotional drama. The first half focuses on establishing the world of the fishing community, highlighting their customs and daily struggles. The romance is seamlessly woven into the setting, making it easy to invest in Raju and Satya's bond. The second half shifts gears with the conflict in Pakistan, adding layers of tension and patriotism to the narrative. While the screenplay has its highs and lows, the director's storytelling keeps the film engaging. The symbolic use of the lighthouse and the fish insignia flag is a smart touch, though some might feel that the emotional and romantic depth could have been explored further.Naga Chaitanya delivers his career-best performance, slipping into the role of Raju with remarkable ease. His accent takes a little getting used to, but once past that, his portrayal is gripping. Whether it's romance, action, or emotional moments, he delivers convincingly. Sai Pallavi is once again in her element, effortlessly emoting through every frame. However, those who have seen her in recent films like Amaran might feel she treads a familiar path with an emotionally heavy role. That said, she brings sincerity to Satya's character, and her chemistry with Chaitanya works well.The supporting cast, including Karunakaran and Prakash Belawadi, put in solid performances, ensuring that the world of Thandel feels authentic. Each character adds weight to the story, and their performances help build the film's emotional depth.Music director Devi Sri Prasad elevates the film with a powerful background score. The songs blend well with the narrative, and the music enhances key moments. The cinematography, handled by Shamdat, deserves a special mention. The visuals beautifully capture the raw and unpredictable nature of the sea while also bringing out the warmth of the village.The dance sequences are choreographed well, adding to the film's energy, and the action scenes are staged effectively with cinematic appeal. The editing is effective for the most part, but certain portions could have been crisper. Some sequences stretch a bit longer than necessary, affecting the film's pacing. Production values are high, with meticulous attention to detail in bringing the fishing community's world to life.Thandel is an engaging romantic action drama that delivers on its promise. While there are moments where the narrative could have been tighter, the film's decent storytelling, moving music, stunning visuals and brilliant lead performances ensure it leaves an impact. If you're looking for an intense love story with drama, action, and a touch of patriotism, Thandel is worth a watch.",

Too loud, in fact. I thought it was the cinema's 'fault', though based on a quick browse online it's a thing with some releases (e.g. Tamil's 'Kanguva') from this part of the world. I don't overall mind the loudness, my ears disagree though!Nice that I got to see my first Telugu-language movie on the big screen, surprised I haven't seen one before. Naga Chaitanya stars in it and has good screen presence, he is the standout; his character is fun to watch. Other pluses include Sai Pallavi, the dance chorography and the action.",

The movie strikes an emotional chord while incorporating elements of action, offering a balanced mix of sentiment and intensity.Naga Chaitanya's performance stands out as one of the film's strongest aspects. His portrayal of the lead character is engaging, capturing both the emotional depth and action-driven elements with remarkable authenticity. The actor fully immerses himself in the role, giving a 100% commitment to the performance.However, it's Sai Pallavi who truly owns the screen. Her portrayal is nothing short of legendary, further cementing her status as one of the industry's most talented actresses. Sai Pallavi is, without a doubt, the highlight of the movie, bringing an emotional gravity to each scene, making her presence feel like the heartbeat of the film. She elevates \"Thandel\" in every way, ensuring that viewers remain glued to the screen.On the music front, Devi Sri Prasad's score is decent, though it doesn't entirely stand out in comparison to his previous works. The soundtrack serves its purpose but doesn't elevate the emotional experience as one might expect.Overall, \"Thandel\" is a one-time watch for those seeking a movie filled with sentiment and action. While the music may not leave a lasting impression, the strong performances from Naga Chaitanya and especially Sai Pallavi make it worthwhile.Rating: 3/5 stars.",

I was also delighted to see a female director in the chair for the first time and if she brought anything different.Well, whatever she and the rest of the crew and cast did, it worked for me.These films aren't Zero Dark Thirty or Black Hawk Down and they don't ever pretend to be. I don't know what the budget is or how many days they get but you can bet it ain't much and what they manage to do always looks on point. I also like the fact the characters at least look believeable. Too often filmmakers seem to panic and include a female actor to tick a box who let's say fits several requirements but last time I checked, being beautiful and busty, slim and feminine doesn't always mean you can pack a punch an realisitically look like you can carry all that kit and shoot a whopping great gun. The female actors in this however were awesome, fit and could whoop ass with the best of them.That also leads me to weapons. Chad told me they used new sniper rifles in this installment and whilst I admitedly know most of my big guns from Fortnite, they certainly all looked like they were handling them correctly which can be really off-putting when an actor hasn't been correctly shown how to do it. Again Chad told me there were ex-military experts, tactical advisors and armorers on set and you could tell the actors were well trained.The Sniper films always deliver on stunts and explosions, gunfire and hand to hand combat and this had it all too plus a nice arc for Brendan taking a rookie under his wing.This franchise may not get the box office treatment but it is what you expect it to be - fun, entertaining high quality DTV military action with reacurring characters we love to spend time with and I for one hope we stay with Beckett for many years to come.",

At that point, though, it's just another hour of fighting -- unrealistic fighting at that. The fights with the females are the worst; they're slowed down so we can see what badasses they are supposed to be. Five members of a militia that's heavily armed with guns decide instead to battle against one woman with knives and machetes instead of just shooting her.We don't really get enough information about the bad man running the country.Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz and Arnold Vosloo play their parts well. The rest of the cast just doesn't have enough to work with.They're definitely resting on the popularity of the other Sniper movies.",

However, there's enough bloody, gory action - some of it in John Woo-style slow motion - to sink a ship. Maybe two.Chad Michael Collins returns from and centre as Brandon Beckett for the eighth time in a row. He was almost being a bit-player in the last two movies, but is unquestionably the star once again, kicking butt and taking names. The dude is a lethal weapon.Ryan Robbins' Zeke Rosenberg is also back (for the fourth time), and the chemistry between the two is spot on. The character has really grown on me since \"Sniper: Assassin's End\".The title makes you wonder if there'll be a twelfth entry in the franchise. Here's hoping that we haven't seen the last of Beckett and Rosenberg in acion.",

I was hoping for intense sniper action, tactical maneuvers, and thrilling gunfights, but instead, the film delivers a series of poorly executed fight scenes.The action sequences, especially those involving the female soldiers, felt exaggerated and unrealistic to the point of being embarrassing to watch. While I understand it's a movie, the lack of logic in these scenes made them difficult to take seriously.The title itself, \"The Last Stand,\" doesn't seem to have much significance in the story. The final battle is filled with irrational decisions, though I won't spoil it. Unfortunately, the plot is underwhelming, and even Chad Michael Collins, who has been solid in past films, fails to deliver a compelling performance. Overall, this installment is a major disappointment for the franchise.",

The action set pieces are beautifully worked and are fun to watch. The cast does a decent job overall on the combat scenes and handling the weapons. One of the drawbacks is that the enemy is shown to be too weak and does not have much of a character, and the development of the characters is bland.

It's an important expression in Zulu culture, showing their strength and determination to keep going no matter what happens. It reminds the Zulu people to stay strong and true to their values, even in difficult times.This phrase is used in stories, proverbs, and songs to teach lessons about being tough and staying connected to their community and ancestors.So, \"efile noma ephila\" is a way of saying that the Zulu people will keep going and stay strong, no matter what.Nb: The name \"Esterhazy\" comes from Hungary. It is connected to a place called Esterh√°za near Dunajsk√° Streda, which is now in Slovakia. The Esterhazy family started in southwestern Slovakia and became important in Hungarian history, especially with people like Count Nikolaus Esterh√°zy and Prince Paul Esterh√°zy.Count Nikolaus Esterh√°zy (1583-1645) was a powerful nobleman in Hungary. He helped the Habsburg monarchy and fought against the Turks. He became Palatine of Hungary and was important in making Hungary stronger.Prince Paul Esterh√°zy (1635-1713) was Nikolaus's son and the first prince of the Esterh√°zy family. He was a great soldier, fought the Ottoman Turks, and supported the arts. He made the Esterh√°zy family very rich and powerful.",

        "content": "# \"Play Dirty\" - A Gritty Crime Thriller**Starring:** Theo Rossi, Ron Perlman, Teresa Celeste\n**Director:** Tom DeNucci\n**Writers:** Tom DeNucci, Chad Law, Theo Rossi\n**Platform:** Tubi## The Underworld's Deadly GameIn \"Play Dirty,\" Theo Rossi delivers a commanding performance as a corrupt cop working for a crime boss who finds himself with Internal Affairs on his back. When his criminal overlord demands he eliminate the competition, he's forced into a desperate race against time, needing to complete his deadly mission if he ever wants to leave town alive.## Rossi's Tour de ForceWhat immediately stands out is Rossi's multifaceted involvement in the project - not only starring but also co-writing the screenplay alongside Tom DeNucci and Chad Law. This level of creative investment clearly shows in his performance. Known for his work in \"Sons of Anarchy\" and \"Luke Cage,\" Rossi continues to prove his talent for portraying complex antiheroes. Here, he embodies his character with a captivating mix of ruthlessness and desperation, creating a protagonist caught between the law he's sworn to uphold and the criminal world he's become entangled in.## Style Over Substance?Director Tom DeNucci creates a visually striking film that effectively utilizes Tubi's more modest budget. The cinematography embraces shadows and gritty urban environments to create a neo-noir aesthetic that feels both contemporary and timeless. The addition of veteran actor Ron Perlman to the cast adds gravitas to the proceedings, though at times the stylistic choices overshadow character development for some of the supporting players.## Pacing and PlotThe film maintains a brisk pace, with tightly choreographed action sequences interspersed with moments of genuine tension. The script offers enough twists to keep viewers engaged, particularly in how it explores the dynamics between dirty cops and the criminals they're meant to apprehend. The blurring of these lines creates compelling moral dilemmas, though some plot developments rely too heavily on coincidence rather than character motivation. The third act, while thrilling, sacrifices some of the moral complexity established earlier for a more conventional resolution.## Final Verdict\"Play Dirty\" doesn't reinvent the crime thriller genre, but it doesn't need to. What it offers is a solid, engaging story elevated by Theo Rossi's magnetic performance. For fans of gangster and crime dramas who appreciate the \"dirty cop\" subgenre, this Tubi original delivers an engrossing tale of survival and moral compromise.The film succeeds most when it leans into its strengths: Rossi's acting prowess, atmospheric visuals, and moments of genuine emotional weight. While it may not reach the heights of premium cable crime dramas, \"Play Dirty\" proves that Tubi's original content can compete in the increasingly crowded streaming marketplace.If you're looking for a weekend watch that delivers action, intrigue, and a protagonist worth investing in, \"Play Dirty\" should definitely make your watchlist.",

Well worth watching, even though the ending has been seen many times before and is very much predictable. The writers could have broadened their minds and done it differently to make this more than a 6/10 movie experience.",

The plot was interesting and I liked that it wasn't confusing , considering it's going back in forth in time. It was well shot, the performances were OK, although it was obvious at times Adam Woodward is not American. In the end though, that didn't matter as Mr. Woodward is so charismatic on screen and the camera loves him. Whoever directed this movie and whoever shot it, knew to use many close-ups of his handsome, flawless face. The entire production had a nice atmosphere and there was genuine chemistry between the leads. This is obviously not a Hollywood big budget production which was a good thing. B Movies tend to be much more interesting than what Hollywood currently churns out. I would recommend giving this a watch for Adam.",

The time travel elements are poorly explained, and the plot lacks cohesion, leaving audiences waiting for answers that never arrive. The characters are largely one-dimensional, with Jon Voight miscast as a clueless businessman. Charlotte Vega and Marton Csokas bring some appeal, but their talents are underused. Cheap visuals, dark sets, and uninspired production design add to the movie's shortcomings. Emotional moments fall flat due to unclear connections between characters and events. With forgettable dialogue and no standout scenes, this film is unremarkable and unlikely to be revisited. A disappointing effort overall.",

        "content": "Nandamuri Balakrishna has been delivering solid mass entertainers since Akhanda. With a careful approach to script selection and collaborations with young directors, he's been connecting with a new generation of audiences. Expectations were naturally high for Daaku Maharaaj, especially with director Bobby, who previously delivered a blockbuster with Chiranjeevi. The trailer, packed with slick visuals and stylish sequences, only amplified the hype.Balakrishna looks incredibly stylish in the first half, with cinematographer Vijay Karthik's striking visuals and dark tones giving the movie a Hollywood feel. Bobby's sleek direction and fresh presentation keep the first half engaging, despite the kid-sentiment subplot feeling repetitive-it's reminiscent of Balakrishna's previous film Bhagavat Kesari. Still, the stylish execution and the mystery surrounding Balakrishna's protection of the little girl maintain interest. The baby girl, who is central to the story, delivers a commendable performance. Urvashi Rautela's role feels unnecessary, but her glamorous presence caters to mass appeal. The \"Dabidi Dibidi\" song is a highlight for fans. Interestingly, the real heroines don't appear until the second half, an unusual choice. The interval bang, featuring the introduction of Bobby Deol as the antagonist, is well-executed and exciting.The second half, however, falters. The setup of oppressed common people suffering under corrupt villains has been explored in countless films like Khaleja, KGF, and even the recent Saripodhaa Sanivaaram. The storyline lacks freshness, and themes of drugs and smuggling evoke comparisons to Vikram and Leo.Among the heroines, only Shraddha Srinath gets a somewhat meaningful role, though her sudden brotherly bond with Balakrishna's character feels unconvincing. Pragya Jaiswal's character, unfortunately, lacks depth. Similarly, Bobby Deol's antagonist feels half-baked-his confrontation scenes with Balakrishna lack the impact they should have had. Balakrishna's Daaku persona is let down by weak makeup and inconsistent character depth. While his rugged look with a bull beard stands out, his clean-shaven appearance as an engineer doesn't quite fit the intense action sequences. The transformation into the Daaku could have been more gradual and impactful. Additionally, the scenes where his followers kneel in awe feel overly theatrical.The remaining cast does their job adequately, but many actors sadly end up as padding artists, with little to contribute to the story.Thaman's background score is one of the movie's strongest aspects. The Daaku theme is outstanding and at times feels reminiscent of Anirudh's style, showing Thaman's versatility. His music elevates many key moments. Vijay Karthik's cinematography is another highlight. His work, as seen in Jailer, brings a unique visual flair to Daaku Maharaaj. His use of color schemes and lighting makes Balakrishna's stylish portrayal stand out, especially in the first half.Director Bobby aimed to repackage Balakrishna for Gen Z audiences with a stylish narrative and mass-elevation moments, and he succeeded in that regard. However, the film's story and core themes feel overly familiar, lacking the novelty to truly stand out.You can watch Daaku Maharaaj for Balakrishna's new look, his signature dialogues, and the stylish execution. Just don't expect an innovative or groundbreaking story.",

This movie tracks well with Balakrishna template where he is introduced as nobody but has a flashback where was a savior of people and he unleashes that fierceness in the climax. No surprises there. This movie was as predictable as sunrise and sunset.While there is nothing wrong with formulaic commercial mass movies, the way this particular movie is written is an insult to the audience. The makers planned a \"high elevation\" scene every 10 minutes where we see Balakrishna uttering a senseless \"punch dialogue\" to cater to the \"masses\" followed by equally senseless songs with disgusting lyrics disguised as \"mass numbers\" all the while aided by S. Thaman's raucous background score that he lifted from Anirudh's Jailer theme \"Alapara\" and Hans Zimmer's Dune desert bass. Fortunately, this movie was not as loud as his other recent works so that's a concession, I guess.While the movie shows so many objectionable scenes, especially involving little girls and women, the audience have to come accept that these form the core of a \"Balakrishna Template\". This is an unfortunate development where the audience make this kind of low effort scrap a commercial success. I cringed a little every time Balakrishna spanks the female lead in the movie. If that is not enough, the director Bobby Kolli made a little girl, probably a 6 year old, spank the female lead for Balakrishna in the name of \"mass\". Not stopping there, the liberal use of double entendres which leave no room for imagination is low even for Balakrishna's standards. The screenplay leaves no element of surprise by providing you exactly what you'd expect to happen exactly at the time you'd expect to happen.What felt fresh, again for a Balakrishna template, was the cinematography. They were more subdued than a typical Balakrishna movie. However, the color grading was all over the place. There are scenes where excessive grunge effect was applied turning blood into a black colored liquid, again, presumably, to appease to the masses I guess.Bottomline: This movie was a low effort scrap that caters to very specific set of audience.",

Bobby understands the strengths of the hero and he elevates them exceptionally well. I believe this will be the biggest blockbuster for this Sankranthi.",

        "content": "Watchable, Good Commercial Movie;Positives:1. Good cinematography with good editing. Also the BGM in some important scenes was good.2. Not many unnecessary forced humor. Especially 2nd half flashback portions were well paced and focused instead of fooling around.3. Well executed interval scene with Thaman bgm delivering goosebumps.4. It's an usual popcorn movie, and it doesn't pretend to be something profound. But it felt way better than NBK's last 2 films.5. The screenplay keeps you engaged in the film for the most part (at least the first half and some major parts of the second half also) and the film tries to be family friendly while also catering to its core mass audiences.Negatives:1. Age old storyline (even the interval block is nothing new if you've seen this director's last film) They even hyped up the villains as very dangerous people but they get easily killed by the hero.2. First half doesn't explore the storyline at all. The villains keep sending people, Balayya keeps beating them. There's the usual hero worship. More than this, the scenes with Urvashi were not needed for this film.3. Climax didn't do justice to the hype built at the interval. Half baked attempt by Bobby Koli as usual. It is stylish and enjoyable but not impactful as compared to intro or interval scenes which build the hype for the ending.4. The songs deviate from the story exactly when the story starts to get interesting. There's only 2 songs as far as I can remember in the first half. One was fine, other wasn't.Overall, it's a good commercial movie, at least visually, but better work in the film's 1st half's storyline and in ending, could've made it even more enjoyable.",

Ravi kishan's acting is superb, and I enjoyed it. Urvashi's character is a Police Inspector, but I don't know if I'm blind; I didn't see her in uniform, and the way she portrayed her character is not justified.

The acting is nice and music is good.This movie proves that balayya is never in his peak but he is his peak. The movie did not miss the commercial elements. But urvashi rautela's role was shortened and it was good that way, otherwise it would have spoiled the work. Though it may feel overdramatic sometimes it is perfect for the sankranti season to have mass movie like this.A good movie if you can enjoy keeping the logics and all other things behind. It was better than most balayya's movies in the past ten years.I don't understand why people are so obsessed with other movies this sankranti because people were ready to see all the things balayya use to do back then but does not want to watch him in a role where he has the scope to act good which he did.The movie is a surprise to me.

        "content": "So in these tight competition of pongal releases at boxoffice i watched 'Daaku Maharaaj' starring Nandamuri Balakrishna in lead,Written and directed by Bobby(Ravindra Kolli). So if you ask me to describe my experience of watching this action drama in one line,without any hesitation this is that better balayya film we urged for but also surprisingly one of the finest technical work brought up in commercial cinema of telugu. Thaman stands out to be the biggest benchmark of film through his music,he literally conquered the whole show. Further going in detail,dividing the film into two halfs.The first half is brilliantly crafted with racy screenplay,where the film is so fast paced and engaging that you wonder the interval was to quick,yet not only the interval sequence but the whole high moments placed in this half work very well. Keeping the dabidi dibidi song aside there was no irrelevant or uneccessary tropes introduced in the film,which makes this stand out from previous balayya films. Interval banger leaves you in a immense high.Coming to the second half,the film's main conflict or basically the core of daaku is established. And this half may feel lengthy due to the predictable proceedings and conflicts take place,which are not new to us and we have been seeing them over the years. But it keeps you hooked throughout,and the climax ends in a decent way. But there is a sequence particularly in this half which completely stand out in whole film,in terms of balayya's performance and writing.Coming to the performances,balayya was phenomenal. Not in just action setpieces or high moments,but also a emotional weightage he brings in few scenes were perfect. Undeniably one man show. And Bobby deol tries but the treatment or writing which was given to his character was underwhelming. Coming to the female leads,Both Pragya jaiswal and Shraddha srinath delivered decent performances.Coming to technical aspects,if balayya is a devotion then ss thaman would be the greatest devote. His music was stands to be the backbone of film,it was just splendid. The adrenaline rush and the goosebumps served through his music is just exhilarating. The camera work of the film is just surprising and as discussed above one of the finest for commercial cinema,Vijay karthik kannan beautifully brings a essence and visual appeal for the film through his cinematography. Action choreography of film was perfect and there was no sequence felt over the top or illogical as previous ventures of balayya,it was grounded. The production values are biggest asset of film,kudos to producer Naga vamsi for me currently the most relevant and clever producer and production house. The craft and consistency brought up is just testament and and adore to profession.Coming to writer and director Bobby,although there was no innovation in terms of plot taken it had that same basic formula,but he delivered that perfectly with good amount of highs throughout the movie. He had stick to the core and didn't dilute the script with uneccessary or over the top segments which makes this stand out in the filmography of actor. And the cinematic approach took to tell the story although regular with brilliant technicalities felt impressive.At last,Daaku Maharaaj is that much needed balakrishna's substance with style where thaman holds you every moment through his rocking score. I don't know how the film resonates in digital watch. But for me it was a good theatrical watch!",

As for Nandamuri Balakrishna, he has certainly reached an age where leading roles like this no longer suit him. An out of shape, visibly aging actor clinging to such scripts does more harm than good. Why keep emphasizing his age? Well, what else can you say when he has to perform dance moves while sitting on a chair?And then there's Urvashi Rautela, did she even get paid for anything other than unnecessary skin show, leading to unwanted vulgarity? In one word, she has \"ridiculed\" herself.As for Bobby Deol, the audience was far more entertained reminiscing about his performance in Animal rather than anything he did in this film.In short, there's absolutely nothing new here, just an incoherent mess of a storyline that keeps jumping from one plot point to another, only to end up being completely meaningless.

While this is just a part of the storyline, I've noticed a similar trend in South Indian films, like *Pushpa*, where villains are often depicted from a Rajput background. This kind of portrayal can create a negative perception and set a biased narrative against the community. The Rajput community has contributed immensely to India, including its democratic foundations, by making sacrifices and integrating the nation. Every community deserves respect, and filmmakers should be mindful of this. Instead of associating villains with specific surnames or castes, they should create characters that don't generalize or stereotype any particular group.",

The story is predictable, the action sequences are over-the-top, and the dialogues feel repetitive. It follows the same tired formula of mass entertainers, offering nothing fresh for audiences who have seen these tropes countless times before.One of the most baffling aspects of the film is the romantic subplot. A 64-year-old protagonist being paired with a much younger actress feels forced and unnecessary. In reality, reports suggest that the lead actor paid the actress 3 crore for this role, making it seem like a self-indulgent move rather than a genuine creative choice. This not only disrupts the film's believability but also raises questions about the industry's priorities.Despite these flaws, the cinematography stands out as a rare positive. The cameraman does an excellent job capturing the action and visuals, making the film look polished even when the storytelling falls flat. However, no amount of great visuals can save a film bogged down by weak execution and outdated storytelling.Overall, Daaku Maharaaj is a forgettable film that relies on the same old tricks without offering anything innovative.

Logic has no place in a commercial entertainer, the screenplay does lose it's steam before the final act and there are no twists in the tale. With the antagonists being no match to the hero, Daaku Maharaaj had to do 105cr in the weekend itself, showering expensive gifts to Urvashi by her parents...",

        "content": "Daaku Maharaj\" delivers a chaotic blend of action, drama, and...well, let's just say \"unique\" performances. The film certainly doesn't lack for energy, and the story, while a bit convoluted, manages to hold your attention. The cinematography captures the rustic setting well, and some of the action sequences are genuinely thrilling.However, the film is significantly hampered by some uneven acting. While some of the cast members deliver solid performances, Urvashi Rautela's portrayal is, unfortunately, a major distraction. Her performance veers into the realm of cringe-worthy, with exaggerated expressions and a delivery that feels painfully forced. It's a shame, as the character had potential, but the execution falls flat.Despite this significant flaw, \"Daaku Maharaj\" manages to be entertaining in its own bizarre way. If you're willing to overlook the moments of truly bad acting and embrace the film's over-the-top nature, you might find yourself enjoying the ride. Just be prepared for some serious eye-rolling. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 for the sheer audacity.",

While his storytelling is too indulgent regarding runtime, there's no denying the sheer energy and inventiveness he brings to the screen. This time, he plunges us into a vivid, chaotic, and deeply human story that fuses action, humor, and social commentary.Enrico Borello ( The Invisible Thread, Settembre, Familia, Supersex) delivers his most mature performance yet, shedding the supporting roles of his early career to fully embrace a lead character as rugged as he is endearing. His portrayal of a Roman cook navigating a whirlwind of conflicts-both personal and external-anchors the film with a raw, unpretentious charm. Watching him embody this role with such ease and charisma suggests he's ready for even bigger challenges ahead.A standout element is Yaxi Liu, who doesn't just bring physical prowess to the screen with her martial arts skills but also a compelling emotional presence. Meanwhile, Marco Giallini and Sabrina Ferilli add depth and charisma.What sets this film apart is Mainetti's ability to merge stylized action with deeply rooted cultural elements. Multicultural Rome, in his hands, becomes more than just a backdrop; it's a living, breathing character, full of contradictions, grit, and poetry. His fearless approach to blending different genres makes for an exhilarating experience .",

        "content": "The Daylong Brothers is the kind of movie that sticks with you-not just because of its story, but because of how intense and grounded it feels. It's a Western with a strong sense of atmosphere, a lot of tension, and some seriously good performances. While it doesn't totally nail everything, it's a gripping ride that's worth watching if you're into slower, character-driven stories with bursts of brutal action.The GoodFirst off, the cinematography is incredible. Every shot looks like it was carefully planned, making the film feel more expensive than it probably was. The dusty, worn-down settings feel real, and the way the movie uses light and shadows really adds to the mood. It's not just about looking cool-it actually helps build tension in a way that keeps you on edge.The action, when it happens, is brutal and feels earned. This isn't a non-stop shootout kind of Western-it's more about tension building up until violence has to happen. And when it does, it hits hard. The gunfights aren't flashy, they're messy, fast, and realistic. You feel every shot, and the stakes always feel high.Another thing that works really well is the film's themes of redemption, violence, and faith. It's not preachy, but you can tell it has something to say about guilt and the cost of revenge. It gives the story more weight than just a simple \"good guy vs. Bad guy\" setup.The Not-So-GoodAs much as I liked the movie, it's definitely not for everyone. The pacing is slow, sometimes a little too slow. There are moments where it feels like the film is sitting in its own mood for too long, especially in the middle section. It builds tension well, but there are a few scenes that could have been tightened up without losing anything important.Another small issue is that while the dialogue is good, sometimes it leans too hard into being poetic or overly serious.And while the ending is strong, I can see it dividing people. Without giving anything away, it's not the kind of ending that wraps everything up in a neat little bow. It works, but if you're expecting a more traditional resolution, you might walk away feeling a little unsatisfied.Final ThoughtsThe Daylong Brothers is a really well-crafted film with great performances, beautiful cinematography, and intense action. It's not your typical Western-it's slower, heavier, and more focused on character than shootouts. If you're into that kind of thing, you're gonna love it. If you prefer faster-paced Westerns with more action, this might not fully hit for you.Overall, it's a strong, well-made movie that's just a little too slow at times. But when it works, it really works.",

Kind of like a musical but not cabaret, leg kicking, dancing kind of singing. More like bluesey/southern style singing and it's the characters doing it while they're shooting, stabbing, killing, and eradicating demons...is that clear now?I tried watching it a week ago and was not prepared for the singing aspect. I turned it off and assumed the worst. Today, I decided to stop being closed minded and just decided to give it a chance. I'm really glad I did. And there's about 6 or 7 short songs they sing throughout the movie. If you can get through the first 5 minutes of the movie, where the worst song is, you'll be fine. If you want to turn it off like I did the first time, I understand...\nBut the songs get progressively better towards the end, and the one song they're singing while having a chase scene with the El Camino is a great song. And the song at the end is the best. Absolutely love those two songs. (For the record, I'm a metalhead and all the lyrics in all the songs would be lyrics used by the bands I listen to...in case you're wondering what the songs are like...)\nNow, I give it a 7 for the sheer audacity of trying to pull this off in the first place.It's a story about three brothers whose father sold their souls when they were babies to be the greatest blues musician ever. As adults, they strike a deal with the devil's henchman to kill damned souls and send them to hell. In return, they hope to get their own souls back. It's violent, bloody, sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic, and yes, there's the singing part too. It's all so wacky that it really works.It's not GLEE so give it a chance!!",

        "content": "\"Creation of the Gods II\" is a glaring example of how to ruin a promising franchise. The film shamelessly distorts its source material, turning a rich mythological tapestry into a chaotic, nonsensical mess. Characters, once compelling and nuanced, now act in ways that defy logic, making baffling decisions solely to advance a convoluted plot. The sequel abandons the emotional depth and careful storytelling of its predecessor, opting instead for empty spectacle and superficial drama.The pacing is erratic, with key moments rushed and less important scenes dragged out, leaving viewers disengaged. Subplots are introduced and dropped haphazardly, adding to the confusion. The film's attempt to expand the universe feels forced and poorly executed, lacking the coherence and charm that made the original captivating.Worst of all, \"Creation of the Gods II\" betrays the goodwill earned by the first film. Fans who were drawn to the series for its faithful adaptation and rich character development will find little to appreciate here. Instead of building on the strengths of its predecessor, the sequel undermines them, leaving a bitter taste and a sense of missed opportunity. A disappointing follow-up that fails to honor its roots or satisfy its audience.",

Continuing the first movie's box office success and technological breakthroughs, Creation of Gods II returns with more VFX shots than the total amount of shots in the previous. Whether the flock of dragons at the Kunlun Mountain, the paralyzing light beams afloat moonless sky, or the mythical gadgets of deities and giants, the film does not fail to entertain with its cinematic interpretation of classical figures, warfare, and anecdotes. The climactic battle of the \"ten deadly formation\" greatly balances quests of individual characters with the story's progression and involves numerous ancient tactics of war by Sun Tzu, such as sowing dissension, sowing discord, extraction, espionage, and assassination. All the meantime, director Wuershan is able to maintain quality narrative and aesthetic control of the coloring, lighting, costume, production design, and music accompaniment.Performance wise, everyone except the two young protagonists from last film is terrific. Huang Bo, Kris Phillips, and Hsing-Kuo Wu --- all reputable actors and obvious carriers of their parts. Nashi's General Deng Chanyu veritably surprised me: a fierce warrior bound to war and honor who gradually reveals her capacity to love, compassion, and dancing by the fire. Even trivial side characters with less than minutes of screen time shine in their sequences.The pacing of the movie's first half and some of the CGI (the blue giant) could definitely be improved, but overall a laudable success for a commercial film.",

There are many metaphors, and the director weaves the plots masterfully. The theme of the movie is loving people. What/Who does one fight for? Every twist and turn in the movie is the main characters trying to find the answer to the question.I cried seeing the thousands of names rolling on the screen at the end. Some people have gone. They didn't live to see their work in theatre. The crew started to make the movies about eight years ago and conquered many obstacles to bring the movies to the audience.

As a sequel, it expands on the world introduced in its predecessor, delivering a storyline that is both grand in scale and deeply personal in its emotional resonance.The film's strength lies in its impeccable visual effects. The mythical creatures, grand battles, and magical elements are brought to life in a way that is both awe-inspiring and immersive. The CGI is top-notch, setting a new standard for the genre. Every frame is meticulously crafted, with vibrant colors and meticulously detailed action sequences that draw you deeper into its fantastical world.

The storyline is rich and layered, with new characters introduced who are compelling and well-developed. What truly makes \"Demon Force\" stand out is its emotional depth. Despite the larger-than-life battles and supernatural occurrences, the film never loses sight of its characters' personal struggles. The themes of sacrifice, loyalty, and the consequences of power are explored in poignant and thought-provoking ways.The performances are outstanding across the board. The cast has excellent chemistry, with each actor fully embodying their respective roles. The protagonist's journey is particularly moving, as they face moral dilemmas and the weight of their actions. The supporting characters are not just sidekicks; they have depth and provide crucial moments of insight and emotional connection to the larger narrative.The pacing of the film is well-balanced, ensuring that the action doesn't overpower the heart of the story. There is a sense of urgency and tension throughout, but also quiet, reflective moments that ground the fantasy in human emotion. Director's vision is clear, crafting a movie that appeals to both fans of high fantasy and those looking for a story with emotional depth.In conclusion, \"Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force\" is a triumph in every aspect. From its stunning visuals to its emotionally charged performances and gripping storyline, this film is a must-see for anyone who appreciates epic cinema.

Meantime, the folks in that city are ruled by a young man \"Ji Fa\" (Yosh Yu) who is enthusiastic and honourable, but not exactly a tactician. Despite his best efforts, the encroaching army arrives at the walls of his city aided by four powerful giants, all equipped with magical talisman. It's during this battle that the lines are truly drawn with a few immortals coming to the aid of the city and with both \"Ji\" and \"Deng\" finding themselves facing a new scenario for which neither are prepared, and which tests their mettle and their loyalties as an angry denouement looms. This is my kind of film: mixing mystery and mythology with superb special effects and a solid story that, though maybe a little predictable towards the end, has all the ingredients of a stylish and engaging acton-adventure. There's imagination a-plenty gone into the production and the characterisations offer us a little more than just the usual linearly flat persona. The green flying ogre works hard for his living here, and the last twenty minutes are lively and colourfully delivered. Might their be a trilogy? It does need a cinema, a big screen makes all the the difference.",

Himesh Reshammiya fully commits to his role, giving a performance that's larger-than-life, blending cheesy one-liners with a level of seriousness that somehow makes it all the more absurd.

The graphics and visual effects are embarrassingly outdated, resembling something from a low-budget production rather than a modern action movie. In fact, playing a 90s video game would likely provide a more immersive and visually appealing experience. While the story has some potential, it is ultimately wasted due to an incredibly weak screenplay that lacks depth, coherence, and engaging dialogue.The action sequences, which should have been the movie's strong point, are completely absurd and devoid of any logic. Instead of thrilling, high-stakes moments, viewers are subjected to poorly choreographed fights and unrealistic stunts that make the film feel like an unintentional parody. Every so-called intense moment is ruined by laughable execution, making it impossible to take anything seriously. The movie consistently sacrifices believability for over-the-top, nonsensical action, which only makes it more frustrating to watch.Despite a somewhat decent premise, Badass ultimately fails due to its weak direction, poor pacing, and lack of compelling characters. The performances feel uninspired, with actors delivering lines in a way that lacks emotion or impact. Even the most action-hungry audiences will struggle to find anything worthwhile here. Instead of being an enjoyable, adrenaline-fueled ride, the film is nothing more than a collection of poorly put-together scenes that fail to create any real excitement.In the end, Badass is a massive disappointment. It is an example of how bad filmmaking can completely ruin a potentially good concept. With its terrible visuals, illogical action, and a painfully bad screenplay, it feels like a complete waste of time. Even die-hard action fans would be better off skipping this one.",

But if you want an over-the-top spectacle that celebrates its own ridiculousness, Badass Ravikumar is a wild, fun-filled ride that delivers exactly what it promises.",

        "content": "There are movies. There are experiences. And then there's Badass Ravikumar, which exists in a category of its own. This isn't just a film; it's a love letter to over-the-top Bollywood excess, drenched in melodrama, packed with punchlines, and unapologetically outrageous from start to finish. Himesh Reshammiya plays the titular role with a commitment so intense, you'd think he's leading an epic saga of Shakespearean proportions-except it's a non-stop barrage of slow-motion walks, larger-than-life action, and dialogues that belong on every WhatsApp forward. The music, unsurprisingly, is an instant throwback to Himesh's glory days-auto-tuned, anthemic, and undeniably catchy. The action sequences defy all known laws of physics, the villains are cartoonishly evil, and the plot moves at a breakneck pace, leaving logic gasping for breath in the dust. If you're looking for pure, unfiltered cinematic chaos, Badass Ravikumar is a film that must be seen to be believed.",

Himesh Reshammiya is the embodiment of pure madness in the lead role, playing a character so impossibly badass that it's almost comical. Every action scene is exaggerated to perfection, featuring explosions, flying kicks, and superhuman feats that are straight out of a superhero comic book-only more absurd. The film's music is a high-energy feast of beats that are destined to get stuck in your head. The dialogues are delivered with such drama that you'll be laughing one minute and cheering the next. The storyline itself is almost an afterthought, with a series of events that make little sense, but who cares when you're watching a rollercoaster of epic proportions? The self-awareness in this film is what makes it so enjoyable-it knows it's ridiculous, and that's what makes it so much fun. Badass Ravikumar is a testament to the fact that sometimes the best way to entertain is by embracing sheer absurdity.",

Think gravity-defying stunts mixed with an overabundance of slow-motion shots that will have you laughing one minute and nodding in disbelief the next. Himesh's music, a blend of catchy beats and 90s-inspired tracks, keeps your feet tapping throughout, and the dialogues are dripping with melodrama. No need to search for a coherent plot here-Badass Ravikumar is a self-aware, high-energy spectacle that unapologetically embraces its absurdity, and you'll love it for exactly that.",

In second half or I'll say the last half an hour did try to attempt some comical scenarios due to Johnny lever effort and lines, but that was not holded well. It all became khichri trying to attempt lot of stuff.Bro, keep some genre, atleast you could have kept cheesey or an illogical drama. You could have tried houseful or attempted some south type ammunition drama. But 7 star for courage of the maker, to make such films. I always liked Himesh songs and music contribution. But he tried his luck here with too much songs. He tried to bring his style back. Hope you get more songs to sing or compose in future, but please not moves.

The action is what you'd expect from a film like this: over-the-top stunts, gravity-defying moves, and fight scenes that seem to defy all logic, all mixed with a touch of nostalgia for old-school Bollywood.

This is not a film that cares about being sensible, serious, or realistic-no, it's about the wild ride from start to finish, and it delivers on every single promise. Himesh Reshammiya, in an outrageously over-the-top role, gives us one of his most memorable performances yet. He's larger than life, delivering dialogue with such flair and intensity that it's hard not to laugh in admiration. The stunts are big, loud, and borderline ridiculous, but they have that perfect mix of 80s Bollywood nostalgia and modern meme-worthy absurdity. The music is as catchy as ever, and the dialogue delivery will make you gasp, cringe, and laugh in equal measure. This is the type of movie that's meant to be enjoyed without thinking too hard, and it does that job flawlessly.",

The film is a typical Hindi film that's surprisingly shot well with good enough plot and tonnes of unintentional comedy. Literally, the scenes are not \"comedy scenes\" but they make you laugh your guts out. If you go watch this film with only the intentions of getting your money's worth you are going to love it. Just don't expect it to change your perspective towards cinema like Interstellar or any genuinely good cinema. Himesh was spectacular with okayish acting and supporting actors were given their own story and well-put character which was fun to watch. This movie will remind you of a lot of other films which is also a good touch I guess. Rest, watch and judge on your own. It was a 10/10 entertainer for me. Worth watching at least once.",

Himesh Reshammiya, as the lead, gives a performance that is as entertaining as it is exaggerated, fully diving into every dramatic beat with a sense of fun that's infectious. The film's action sequences are some of the most over-the-top moments you'll witness-think high-octane car chases, impossible fight scenes, and explosions that make no sense but look ridiculously awesome. The music is another highlight, with tracks that are perfectly in tune with the chaotic energy of the film. Every song feels like a dance anthem, adding even more excitement to the ride. And the dialogues are a highlight in themselves-full of memorable, overblown lines that will have you quoting them long after the film ends. The plot may be predictable, but the film's ability to fully embrace its ridiculousness makes it a fun, unforgettable experience.

Himesh Reshammiya plays the titular character with such exaggerated flair that you'll be questioning the limits of his acting skills. The action is overblown and ridiculous in the best way possible, with stunts that would make even the most hardcore action fans raise an eyebrow. The dialogues are laced with melodrama, delivered in such a way that they become iconic in their absurdity.

The action sequences were decent, with a few violent moments-though nothing extreme. As for the songs, they didn't work for me at all. I found myself checking my phone whenever they played, so they were entirely forgettable.The story itself doesn't have much going on, but there are moments that might keep you engaged. However, the real highlight is the dialogues. The film delivers some entertaining dialogue-baazi, making almost every line fun to watch. The narration works well too, and I'd say the witty dialogues are the film's biggest strength.On the downside, logic is definitely optional here. The movie even acknowledges that fact, so I didn't bother critically analyzing it. Still, even setting that aside, it felt like the plot just kept moving forward in a rushed manner without much depth.Overall, I went in for the action and dialogues, and those aspects delivered. There were some genuinely amusing moments, and a few lines made me laugh out of sheer amusement. But aside from that, everything else felt average or below average. It's not a parody or an intentional \"so bad it's good\" film-it just has its moments of fun amidst a fairly forgettable experience.",

Himesh Reshammiya fully commits to his role, giving a performance that's larger-than-life, blending cheesy one-liners with a level of seriousness that somehow makes it all the more absurd. The action is an exaggerated mix of every action-packed Bollywood trope imaginable, where the laws of physics don't apply, but the fun factor is off the charts. The music, characteristic of Himesh, is irresistibly catchy, with beats that are bound to keep you grooving long after the credits roll. The dialogues are dripping with melodrama, creating an aura of nostalgia for fans of 80s Bollywood masala. While the plot may be thin and riddled with plot holes, Badass Ravikumar doesn't need to be anything more than a riotous ride that leaves you laughing and shouting \"this is cinema at its most unapologetic!\" If you're looking for logic, go elsewhere.

Nay, it would be the undisputed champion of disaster, a shining beacon of how NOT to make a movie. The sheer dedication it takes to make something this atrocious is almost commendable-almost.The story? Oh, it's a masterpiece in cringe. A script seemingly fished out from the trash can of a Bhojpuri Film Industry, dusted off, and smeared with every outdated, cheap, and regressive trope imaginable. The dialogues? Written, I assume, by someone who was either held at gunpoint or actively plotting revenge against cinema itself.And let's talk about the scenes-each one a new, spectacular level of torture. The cheesiness is so thick, it could be sliced and sold in grocery stores. Offensive towards women and transgenders? Oh, absolutely. The filmmakers apparently missed the memo that it's not 1985 anymore. And just when you think it can't get any worse, it throws another painfully unfunny, crass, or outright nauseating moment at you.The music? Let's just say, I'd rather listen to a symphony of car alarms and construction drills. The sets and costumes look like they were borrowed from a low-budget college skit-one that the students themselves abandoned out of shame.Vishwak Sen? Poor guy actually tried. And while effort is admirable, his over confidence and the direction he going not to be encouraged. And the female lead-well, what can we say? She's there, alright. Existing. Not her fault, though. She was clearly just told to stand there, wear whatever minimal fabric was handed to her, and add to the film's overall aesthetic of cheap gimmickry disguised as entertainment.Now, let's be honest: this film doesn't need to be banned. That would imply it has some sort of impact. No, this one is self-sabotaging at an elite level. Give it a day, and it will naturally sink into oblivion, where it belongs. So, Jagan Anna fans, don't even waste your time. This film will destroy itself, no effort needed.Verdict: If you love yourself, avoid this. If you hate yourself, still avoid it. Some bad movies are fun to watch ironically-this isn't one of them. It's just a big, fat, insulting waste of time.",

It desperately wants to be clever and entertaining, but instead, it stumbles into a mess of cringe-worthy dialogue, flat performances, and painfully outdated tropes.One of the biggest problems with Laila is how little effort it puts into storytelling. Instead of delivering a cohesive or engaging experience, the film meanders aimlessly, relying on lazy jokes and over-the-top antics that fall flat every time. The humor feels forced, the emotional beats are nonexistent, and there's no real sense of purpose. It's as if the filmmakers assumed loud, exaggerated performances and chaotic energy would be enough to carry the film. They weren't.What's worse is that Laila seems to rely on controversy and shock value to gain attention rather than any actual substance. Instead of putting effort into a meaningful or entertaining story, it leans on gimmicks that only highlight how hollow the entire project is.Ultimately, Laila (2025) is a complete misfire, offering nothing but frustration and regret to anyone who sits through it.

This premise had the potential for clever humor, but instead, we get a barrage of cringe-inducing gags, offensive stereotypes, and juvenile slapstick that feels like it was written by someone who thinks humor peaked in the early 2000s.Vishwak Sen's performance is, at best, a lesson in overacting and, at worst, an absolute embarrassment. Whether he's playing Sonu or Laila, his exaggerated mannerisms and forced comedic timing make it impossible to take anything seriously. The supporting cast fares no better, either sleepwalking through their lines or hamming it up to an unbearable degree. It's as if everyone involved realized midway through filming that they were part of a train wreck but had already signed their contracts.The direction by Ram Narayan is shockingly incompetent. Scenes are cobbled together with no sense of pacing, comedic timing, or emotional weight. The cinematography is bland, the editing is choppy, and the film feels at least an hour longer than it actually is. Every joke drags on for what feels like an eternity, making the movie less of a comedy and more of an endurance test.And then there's the film's desperate attempt to stir controversy, which only highlights how little substance it has to offer. Even the marketing relied on cheap gimmicks and sensationalism, as if the filmmakers knew the content itself was beyond saving. But no amount of controversy can distract from the sheer laziness on display here.Simply put, Laila is an insult to its audience. It's the kind of movie that doesn't just waste your time but actively makes you regret ever pressing play. If there's one thing to take away from this disaster, it's a valuable lesson: just because something gets greenlit doesn't mean it should have been made. Avoid this mess at all costs.",

        "content": "Vishwak Sen, once a promising actor, seems to have completely lost his way in his pursuit of a \"mass hero\" image. Laila is yet another misstep, filled with outdated humor, forced comedy, and an over-reliance on vulgarity to engage the audience.From the very start, the film struggles with weak writing and exaggerated sequences that fail to land. The so-called romantic track between Vishwak Sen and Aakanksha Sharma is poorly executed, relying more on skin show than genuine chemistry. The supporting cast, despite being packed with experienced actors, is wasted on one-dimensional roles that add little to the film.Comedy, which should have been a major strength, falls flat due to an overuse of double-meaning dialogues and crude humor that grows tiresome. The attempt to incorporate Hyderabad Old City slang for laughs backfires, making the humor feel forced rather than organic. To make matters worse, the film drags on with unnecessary fight sequences and forgettable songs, further exposing the lack of fresh ideas.Vishwak Sen has proven his acting chops in the past, but Laila shows that he seems to believe excessive cuss words and below-the-belt jokes are enough to draw in audiences. Unfortunately, it results in an exhausting and forgettable watch.",

After all, at this point in the original novel, Guo Jing's martial arts skills are just beginning to take shape, and his understanding of \"The Greatest Hero\" is not yet profound. This character arc of growth actually develops in the next installment, \"The Return of the Condor Heroes.\" The director's attempt to force the protagonist into becoming a great hero in this film can only be described as 'trying to draw a tiger but ending up with a dog' - a complete failure.",

Definitely not worth the ticket price.I am trying to find something good to say about this movie but unfortunately almost none. Do not recommend it.",

        "content": "As a franchise based on a series of books that are brilliantly written, nationally acknowledged, beloved and familiarised by Chinese people, it already had loads of adaptations, but one dilemma this classic franchise is facing is on one side, the older generations who are familiar with the story and various of versions filmed previously already have a clear idea about who they think the story, the characters are, it will be really hard to offer them a different version and gain acknowledgment from them; on the other side, it takes considerations to think about how to reach out to the younger generations who perceive this franchise as already out of date. I've been a Tsui Hark fan for years and I have believe in him on his vision and abilities on handling wuxia genre, that's why I felt so excited since I knew this project, and it actually didn't disappoint me.First because everyone cares a lot about whether the actors fit the well-loved characters, I'm gonna guarantee you that they all get it so right! I knew there are actor with zero acting experience in the cast but overall their actings are so incredibly sophisticated I was actually in awe, I think that's where Tsui Hark's ability of instructing, monitoring and adjusting actors' performance kicks in, he's really good at it! Btw one thing I loved about Guo Jing's portrayal was I had this feeling that he had intentionally made the Mongolian lines slight ly more fluent than Chinese lines which matches Guo Jing's background (he grew up in Mongol), as a Chinese actor I knew it takes effort to make it happen!Back to the movie itself, that scene Guo Jing and Huang Rong running towards each other in rain was so beautifully filmed and incredibly touching, I actually cried at that moment and strongly feel this is THAT moment I'm gonna ruminate for a long while.The fight scenes were so well-thought and designed so easy to understand how it works, which is what I think always good in Tsui Hark's films, the visual communication never failsI also like the way this film dealing with what we called identity crisis nowadays, our debate was no longer what identity you are, is it where you grew up or where you originally from? GJ's answer after going through all sort of things: its actually the care for ppl mattersI'm not a moviegoer but I had this gut feeling like I am kinda a Tsui Hark fan and I've watched most of his works and I can confidently say when ppl vertically compare this legendary director's works on the timeline and talk about it LOCH will be the work you can always find something interesting.",

Naturally, the focus is not on the earlier romantic entanglements and feuds of the Jianghu, but on the final war. However, this film is not a war movie, but an anti-war movie. At the beginning of the film, it takes just ten minutes to clarify the content of the first few dozen chapters of the original work. If you have written a novel or screenplay, you know how difficult this is. The screenwriter is Tsui Hark himself, and I guess he must have conceived it a long time ago. Congratulations to Tsui Hark.The best part is that although Tsui Hark seems to have made many changes, after compression, it is very faithful to the original, especially in the restoration of the male protagonist Guo Jing. It has always been thought that the dramatization of the TV series does not generally focus on the last few chapters, and Guo Jing's important growth stages are ignored, making this character less attractive to audiences than Huang Rong. Xiao Zhan's portrayal of Guo Jing matches the character I imagined while reading the book: determined, persistent, and responsible. His initial simplicity upon entering central China is due to him growing up on the grassland without Jianghu experience.Tsui Hark's cinematography remains beautiful, the actors are excellent, the special effects are pleasing, the fight scenes are cleverly designed, and the plot rhythm demands full concentration. It is a great movie-watching experience.",

It's also a complete blockbuster that sweeps you right into the thick of the battle scenes.I really enjoyed Tony Leung's character, he seems to be such a sincere antagonist and had the whole theatre in stitches with his antics.If I had to pick something to criticize, it would be that certain scenes appeared to be removed from the final cut, such as the scenes where Guo Jing led the Mongol army, which I feel could've really added to his characterisation and the motives behind his actions. Not sure why this edit was made - to reduce the length of the film perhaps?Nonetheless, I found this movie to be thoroughly entertaining.

        "content": "When I was a child, I often saw rows of old Jin Yong novels in my grandfather's bookshelf. When I was bored, I liked to flip through them. This was my earliest martial arts enlightenment. I didn't expect Tsui Hark to bring it to the big screen, so I took my family to watch it together. On the scene, the language of the camera is excellent. When it's romantic, it's romantic; when it's grand, it's shocking. As it's a real-life shooting, the desert sand, mountains, and rivers in the camera are very eye-catching. I don't know where the director found such a beautiful place. In terms of the characters, there are all kinds of ugly characters. The actors portray each character plumply. Guo Jing is chivalrous and upright, Huang Rong is smart and intelligent, the Chinese zither is free and decisive, the sweat is not angry and arrogant, Ouyang Feng is paranoid and unlucky (to the end, a little distressed). The rest of the funny responsibilities of the Beggars' Sect will not be repeated. The female characters portrayed by Tsui Hark are too well crafted. Women are not only delicate, sensitive, and charming, but also free spirited, brave, and cunning. Women naturally have a sense of empathy and identification with each other (I really dislike female competition!).In terms of music, it perfectly matches the plot. When the opening song plays countrymen DNA, it moves people into the world of martial arts. The Mongolian songs at the end of the film are bold and unrestrained, and the mood is lifted after listening to them. This time, I watched it with my family of eighteen, without any bloody, borderline, or intimate scenes. The plot is full of laughter and tears, making it perfect for the whole family to go to the cinema together. For me, it's a five-star movie, but even after watching it, I still feel unsatisfied and will immerse myself in watching it for a second time.",

I love the theme as well, very beautiful and matching well with the story.It is film that I enjoyed very much and gave me a lovely night (thought the ticket price is quite high compare to some others i think it is worthy).",

Compassionate towards ordinary people, he gave up high - ranking positions and great wealth in Mongolia, chose to safeguard the peace of the border regions of Song density, and ultimately sacrificed his life for this cause. The film features extraordinary lighting and visual effects, particularly romantic. The actor Xiao Zhan has depicted an extremely upright and reliable knight - errant image, and his acting skills have won wide acclaim. Director Tsui Hark is among the most outstanding directors in the realm of martial arts films. He has always been adept at using romantic cinematic language in his works, and is also known for his creative adaptations of original novels.",

Watching it in the IMAX theater was extremely shocking, especially the fighting scene between Guo Jing and Ouyang Feng, which was very enjoyable to watch! Tsui Hark is still as skilled as ever, and within 146 minutes he expressed many important plots in the last few chapters of The Legend of the Condor Heroes in a simple and easy-to-understand way. Although some plots have been slightly changed from the original, the changes are reasonable and the plot is also very coherent. The pace is very brisk, the war and fighting scenes are excellent, and the love scenes are also beautifully shot. The performances of all the actors were outstanding and very consistent with their roles. A highly recommended movie!",

The female lead and the male lead seem to be on a similar level of acting performance, but that doesn't mean it is extraordinary, it is just \"decent\".There were some clear issues with the wirework in some scenes. The production tried to make it up for it with the effect, but in some scenes it is just too noticeable. There were also some changes made... yeah.It is a movie that I wouldn't watch again, but to pass some time it is good or to put it at the back while I am doing something else.If there is a sequel I will check it out, but I will adjust my expectations then.",

The \"Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms\" under his lens transcend mere martial arts choreography-when those palm strikes sweep across the silver screen, the ink-wash Jianghu from Jin Yong's novels suddenly transforms into a flowing epic of light and shadow. Fluttering robes leaping between rooftops, the glint of humanity flashing through sword clashes-these moments resemble the genetic code of martial arts culture awakening in modern cinema. Tsui's genius lies in deconstructing classical chivalry through contemporary visual language: when Qiao Feng unleashes dragon-shaped qi that swallows mountains and rivers with twin palm strikes, audiences witness not just spectacular VFX, but the explosive rebirth of a millennia-old chivalric spirit. Every frame thrums with patriotic fervor and tender heroism, crafting a soul-stirring saga that lingers long after the credits roll.",

Ouyang Feng in the face of subordinates questions and Guo Jing the results of the competition \"each other, can be said to be a narrow victory ~\"; Beggars and Huang Rong pass the message when the funny and so on.

It also summarizes his and Huang Rong's relationship quite concisely and well at the beginning. However, the ending part of the movie does feel a bit forced unfortunately which is bad. In the canon, they never show Ou Yang Feng taking on a whole Mongolian army. While it does make for interesting cinematography and defines Guo Jing as a righteous character these events never happen in the novels. Other than that though, the movie is good and other plot gaps are excusable and I think they did a good job at weaving together the story albeit with some plot holes. Think overall I'd give it a 7.5 but feel any movie about condor heroes probably would need a trilogy such like lord of the rings or Batman to go into the full depth about characters and backstories without misinterpreting canon.",

He also nails some funny one liners one of my faves in particular being from the first fire scene when they discover something about the woman they hit with their car.I really appreciated how a certain aspect of Otis's character was handled aswell that you don't often see in most films or tv series!Spence Moore II does a wonderful job as Jaden and really brings across the character that everyone would want to be friends with even though we learn things aren't so perfect in his world either.Chloe East shines in her role of Cora as well and definitely brought some laughs for me along with bringing the chops during the intense scenes.Going Places gives us thrills, comedy and action with plenty of twists and turns along the way with tender and heartfelt moments mixed in too!

Far different than the average blood sucker flick, this movie is completely original, beyond pleasantly original!It's a really exciting movie made completely independently, the whole cast and crew are all indie gems.The movie features a really rich story filled with vibrant characters, incredible locations, ace cinematography; it's exciting and you can visibly tell while watching this how much effort and time and hard work the cast and crew put into making the film.For me personally, when I watch a movie like this I feel so rewarded by the end, just being able to watch independent artists making art, and Ambrogio : The First Vampire definitely makes you feel that way while watching!I had such fun watching this movie, and I'd love for you to take a BITE out of Ambrogio : The First Vampire!Get it? Bite? Cuz vampires, they..bite. It's funny!Okay, I'm sorry. I wanted to end it with a laugh. I tried. Watch the movie, it's a refreshing new take on the vampire genre with a lot of heart made by some really strong artists. I hope you see it and enjoy it as much as I did.",

Greatly recommend this to all lovers of the genre, and if you're not into it, this film may bring you closer to changing your mind.I don't easily recommend films, as my tastes differ greatly from most everyone out there but I do recommend this one. Heck, if you rent/buy the stream or venture into Walmart and buy the dvd, I wouldn't be opposed to hanging out and watching it again with you. Given the distance, of course.I hope that tells you how strongly I feel about this incredible film.Congratulations to the cast and crew.",

Alex gave a standout performance playing Ambrogio, bringing both intensity and complexity to the character. It's hard to find a film where all actors bring 110% to their roles and I can easily say every actor in this film did just\nthat. Ambrogio is a fresh and impressive addition to the genre.

While Hades and Dracula were important to the story, I never fully got the evil vibe from them. Special effects were good. I wasn't able to feel connected to the character Ambrogio. His troubled soul yearned to be free, but it took a long time for him to find his peace. Nice touch to include some Italian and Greek dialogue in the movie.",

        "content": "Ambrogio is a very impressive achievement for a first-time feature-length director, writer, and crew. Coming in at about 1 hour and 10 minutes, it's a respectable length that doesn't try to go too high too quickly. Even with the small budget, the story and its implications carry greater weight and scope, and the effective location choices help lend the right amount of credibility to these elements.I was also impressed by the unique take on the vampire mythos by taking things back to their furthest roots and developing a character whose origins lie in the birthplace of vampirism. That sort of ancient mythos and lore is always exciting in fiction and fantasy.I think the most successful elements of Alex Javo's film are the actors (especially Mitch Lemos as Hades and Niko'a Salas as Dracula), the music, and the costuming.My one critique for the film, given the subject matter, is I wish a darker lighting scheme and perhaps even color palette had been used to accentuate the macabe and gothic nature of our vampire characters, especially in Ambrogio's home. The use of high contrast or back-lit shots would have lent to showing us a creepier or more mysterious side to Ambrogio.That said, I think Alex and the film greatly succeed in what they set out to do, and its praise and accolades from the indie film community are well deserved.",

At the heart of the story is Omari Russell (played by an incredible lead actor), a single father from Brooklyn who, after being disqualified from the NYPD, becomes a School Safety Officer. His protective instincts are put to the ultimate test when a school shooting occurs at his daughter Mya's school, forcing Omari to face his greatest fear head-on. It's a story of love, courage, and determination in the face of unimaginable danger.What stands out most about The Security Guard is how the film crafts a deeply human story within a thrilling, high-stakes scenario. Omari's journey is emotional and intense, but it's the supporting cast that really shines here, adding incredible depth and nuance to the story. From his daughter Mya, who plays a pivotal role in Omari's emotional drive, to the other characters within the school, each performance adds something unique to the narrative. Their reactions to the crisis, their relationships with Omari, and their individual arcs make the world feel lived in and real.The pacing of the film is expertly done, balancing quiet, reflective moments with moments of heart-stopping action. The tension builds steadily, with the threat of the shooting never overshadowing the emotional core of the story Omari's love for his daughter and his determination to protect her. The film knows when to slow down and allow the characters to breathe, giving you time to really connect with them before throwing you into the next heart-pounding moment.",

There are a fair number of jump scares, especially when viewed in a good theater. Though the concept, twists, and overall story aren't entirely unique, the performances and execution elevate it above the average horror film.I believe this surpasses the quality of Eerie and Deleter, and it's disappointing that it didn't receive the recognition it deserves.

Unfortunately, lack of proper screenplay leaves us restless and bored throughout the film...The whole first half keeps us clueless where is the story progressing, and the conflict opens only by interval. The post-interval scenes are too predictable, and despite the director's ability to bring in familiar faces like Mysskin and Samuthirakani, it doesn't help the film from sinking. Nonetheless, what needs to be appreciated is the unconditional dedication of Arun Vijay and Roshini Prakash. Mysskin's cameo is good, and Samuthirakani's character is okay...Bala's smartness in delivering religious sarcasm was appreciated in all his movies, but he seems to be purposely injected it into this movie for no reason. Sam CS's background score is commendable, and his hard work is evident in every single scene. GV Prakash's melodious numbers are soul-stirring. Overall, it's high time Bala unlearns and tries to explore the unexplored. He has already delivered emblematic masterpieces, thereby letting many amateur and upcoming directors to get inspired by his work. However, it's disappointing to see that he has started replicating his own movies again. Hope he bounces back soon...",

Continuity issues, weird ass transitions, sexy heroines with no real purpose, catchy Vijay Antony tunes, robotic Bollywood-import antagonist (Sonu Sood), and most importantly Santhanam's one-liners -- you name it, this 12-year-old film has got it all! That much-talked-about slapstick stretch featuring Manobala (RIP), Santhanam, Mottai Rajendran, and Vishal is SO FUN, even when we've seen it all before. The \"double six-pack\" climactic set piece also delivers. It's purely riding on the nostalgia factor, nothing else. The body-shaming humor and objectifying dialogues were turn-offs though.",

One thing that I made me very uncomfortable was definitely the Women objectification through the movie.

I understand that it's an old film, but even for its time, it's terrible. There's a difference between something aging poorly and something that was never good to begin with, this falls into the latter category. Every minute felt like an eternity, and I kept saying this to myself \"why am I still watching this?\".The pacing is another major issue. Scenes drag on with no sense of urgency, stretching thin material beyond its breaking point. At times, I wondered if the film had actually ended and I was just experiencing some kind of post-traumatic hallucination.By the time the credits rolled, I wasn't relieved, I was angry. Movies like this make me question my entire existence. If I wanted to waste my time I could have just stared at a blank wall for two hours. At least that would have been less painful.",

        "content": "After many months, I left the theater feeling satisfied. The movie follows a simple and predictable storyline but is filled with classic elements of \"OG\" Sundar C, along with the signature comedy of \"OG\" Santhanam.This film was made 12 years ago, but it's only being released now, and it still feels fresh. The standout feature of the movie is Santhanam, who single-handedly carries the film with his impeccable comedic timing. Every scene he's in is met with laughter from the audience. At one point, I even had a stomach ache from laughing so hard. The final 15-20 minutes, which feature Santhanam, the late Mano Bala, and others, are particularly memorable and had the theater in stitches. It's also worth noting the five songs typical of a Tamil film and some illogical fight sequences. While unrealistic, we still enjoyed them in the theater. At times, I felt like we'd missed these elements in the last 10 years of cinema.I'm truly grateful to have watched this film. I don't understand why Santhanam isn't acting as comedian because every time he delivered a line, the theater erupted with laughter. The director, known for his comedy, has recently moved on to making horror films with lackluster comedic elements. He's one of the finest comedy directors, and I hope this movie's success encourages him to return to this genre.This is a complete theater experience-an ordinary movie made extraordinary by its comedic sequences. It's a family-friendly film, though some of the glamourous moments might lean into comedy a bit too much.Finally, my request is this: if Tamil cinema could create a movie like this 12 years ago, why are modern directors making such boring films? It's disappointing for both their reputation and their fans. I hope this trend changes soon.",

It's a pointless movie and if you go in with that expectation, you're surprisingly not gonna be bored. The good parts are entertaining, the bad parts are so bad that they're so good. The biggest selling point of the film - It was not boring. It was so much better than Indian 2. So much better than Game Changer.I've never been a fan of Santhanam's comedy, so I don't know why hype now, I don't get the \"Come back to comedy Santa!\" Mokka comedy pannitu laughter riot nu sonna.....to each their own. There's a fight in the film which, minus the heroism, almost makes you want to consider how good a serious hand-to-hand combat sequence with Vishal could be....The comedy, the plot, the songs, everything about this film is at least 20 years too late. It would have been a 10-yr late film had it released on time in 2012. This delay worked out in its favor and I guess the nostalgia sold it to the crowds. It's a bad film, but it was not boring üòê",

        "content": "This decade-plus delay is a crucial factor in understanding the film...If you were a fan of Sundar C's brand of comedy from the early 2010s, particularly his collaborations with Santhanam, this film might offer a nostalgic trip. Santhanam's one-liners and comedic timing are often cited as the biggest strength of the movie...\nVishal is said to deliver an acceptable performance in his role. The female leads, Anjali and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, add a touch of glamour and perform adequately within their limited scope...The film doesn't take itself seriously, and if you go in expecting a no-brainer entertainer with plenty of comedy, you might find it a decent timepass. It aims to provide laughs and some action without much depth...\nVijay Antony's songs and background score were decent, though not particularly memorable...The most significant drawback is that the film feels very much like a product of its time (early 2010s). The humor, the plot, and even the technical aspects can feel dated compared to contemporary Tamil cinema...\nThe story is simple and lacks engagement. The pacing can be slow, making the film feel dull at times. The screenplay is considered weak and inconsistent...A recurring criticism is the presence of jokes that are now considered sexist, body-shaming, and generally crude. What might have been acceptable (though still questionable) over a decade ago doesn't sit well with many modern audiences...Sonu Sood's villain character is portrayed as a typical, old-school antagonist, lacking any novelty. The hero-villain face-offs are not impactful, and the climax fight is considered too long and anticlimactic...\nThe editing and cinematography are generally considered unimpressive and below average...Overall:\"Madha Gaja Raja\" is a film heavily impacted by its long delay. While it might offer some nostalgic laughs for fans of early 2010s Tamil comedy, particularly Santhanam's work, it largely feels outdated in terms of its story, humor, and technical execution.",

Why are people putting something like this out is beyond me. It looks like it was filmed in a dark basement. I've seen student films with more talent and effort than this mess. The acting? A complete trainwreck-wooden, unconvincing, and cringeworthy at best.It's frustrating that this garbage even gets attention, taking eyes away from truly good films out there. It's a sad reminder of how low the bar can go in the industry. Avoid this at all costs.",

I remember in the trailer I thought there was a built up conflict between the main character and another girl, kind of like fighting for who's gonna be \"top dog\". But when I watched the film I feel as the trailer misconstrued that because their scenes total together lasted less then two minutes. The second she is introduced she gets killed off. It was built up in a short amount of time just to not have a satisfactory result because we know nothing about their dynamic to feel any kind of reaction to the characters death.",

It's not that hard to find an actor who speaks Russian and English, but apparently that's going too far. They are going to overlay Russian dialogue for the characters.

You'll get the gist of what I'm sayingIt wasnt bad per-se, the main Female lead got an uncanny resemblance to Brigitte Lin in looks and mannerism. It's like a 2025 actress looking exactly like Katherine Hepburn. Something like thatThe Male lead is laughable. No charisma, no acting range and he's a pale shadow of his predecessor Sam Hui and off course Jet Li. The rest of the cast is cardboard character which dont hold a candle to the originalSeen it in Cantonese and it was still a very sweet throwback and nostalgia to my favorite Wuxia movie. The fights are off course much better thanks to CGI but boy the Tsui Hark original doesnt age too bad in retrospectWatch this if you like Xiao Ao Jiang Hu, or just watch it for a Wuxia fantasy fu, but it's a well worth 2 hour if you like these types of movie.",

It was originally meant to be a series, but was condensed into feature-length when funding dried up, and that does show. Watching it, you are left with a large number of questions that this movie never clears up, and there are numerous characters I simply want to see more.But while that is a complaint, I do think that can be seen as a good thing that it does leave me wanting more. I want to see more of the Sara Ellington, Doris Reynolds, and Dr. Blake characters, and see their stories fleshed out more. I am very curious to see more about the aliens and how they ended up on earth.To reiterate, although it has its flaws, I genuinely enjoyed Black Zone and fervently hope to see more of this universe.I also want to add that I think everyone in the cast did an amazing job, and I'm especially inclined to praise the performances of Andrea Fantauzzi, Jennifer Seward, and Matthew Schmidli.",

It jumps between time periods in a way that is at times disconcerting, but in the end manages to pull all these divergent strings together into a rather compelling piece that makes you feel a peculiar empathy for the slightly sociopathic protagonist.The fact that Weissberg was able to accomplish this ambitious concept within the framework of such a limited budget is truly laudable.The performances are all on point and believable, the score, moving and powerful, and the storyline draws you into the Machiavellian existence of its characters.Still, there was some drag to the third act, which might have been lessened with more plot twists, more surprises, but all in all, it was a satisfying film.",

Tony Nato has acted pretty good and Naomi Helen's role was very good and I think she was outstanding. A lot of good lessons to learn from the movies, and I would recommend this movie. I wish the director all best and good luck with all future endeavors.",

The film was as suspenseful as it was emotionally engaging, and we were captivated from start to finish. I found the story both compelling and thought-provoking. The film's pacing is impeccable, offering just the right amount of tension before each twist. The film shines not just through its gripping plot, but through its rich, multifaceted characters. I loved the beautiful dialogue and philosophical conversations shared between the 2 main characters (played by Tony Noto and Naomi Helen Weissberg).All in all, I loved the film and would definitely recommend watching it asap!",

In all the westerns I have watched through out my life, I never heard this quote before. I thought the movie was done very well and there was definite chemistry between the two cast members that played the Marshall and the wanted man. You can tell there was definite on screen chemistry. I was trying to narrow down to what specific drcade this was in , and I thought perhaps 1860's and then saw the wanted poster of Jesse James and believe he was a wanted man during 1869. So the portrayal was pretty accurate and it was entertaining. I also liked the card game that was played between father and son, and the father trying to teach the son life is not fair. I think this young director Viduran Roopan shows us how versatile he truely is with this script he wrote and his directoral debut. I gave this an 8/10, simply because I am expecting bigger things in the future from this very talented director.",

There's a decent bit of CGI for this attack, and although it's no The Revenant, it's done very well considering the limitations and as good as anything on TV.The outcome of the fight leaves the bear dead and the man finds himself in a cabin in the woods.Scared and out of his mind, it is revealed he has been captured by Pat Gunther (a very psychotic turn from James Bryhan) .Dig Me No Grave does very well at positioning all its characters and despite some clunky dialogue, is extremely polished as it clearly sets up the story and everyone's motivations and goals.James Bryhan as the cold and calculated antagonist is a particular highlight. His ghoulish kidnapper echoes the extreme actions of Annie Wilkes from 1990's Misery, who similarly torments an incapacitated man. However, he's given more of a history that makes even this repugnant character have a few reasons for what he's done.But he, along with a solid cast, combine with the film's impressive technical aspects, a slick 90-minute runtime and a host of well-planned dramatic and action sequences, to make Dig Me No Grave a barnstorming and nail-biting local thriller exploring distrust and atonement.",

He was so dynamic throughout the film, and every scene he was in felt completely alive. What really stood out to me was his timing-it was spot on. Whether it was delivering a line that made the tension skyrocket or just reacting to the eerie atmosphere around him, he nailed it every single time.The way he portrayed his character's fear and determination was so believable, it pulled me right into the story. You could feel every bit of dread and uncertainty as if you were living it alongside him. He brought such a powerful presence to the screen without ever overdoing it, and that balance made the whole experience even more chilling.Honestly, James Bryhan made the film for me. Dig Me No Grave is unsettling on its own, but his performance took it to a whole other level. If you get the chance to watch it, I can't recommend it enough-he's absolutely brilliant.",

The only glitch, lies in a couple of performances from the supporting cast , the wife Linda and the best friend Fred.Ranjeet's Screenplay is interesting & successfully captures the violent & unpredictable journey of two strong men. His direction is excellent. The film is a visually appealing , as it captures the wilderness & the beauty of it, without ever looking overdone, making it a 'character' in the movie.Performance-Wise: Warren Hicks and James Bryhan are in great from. Hicks excels as the legless ,bruised and battered hunter with a strong will to survive, while Bryhan oozes subtle menace as well as induces some nice soft ,human touches.

And that has to be laid at the feet of the writers.James Bryhan (Pat Gunther) deserves the awards he's getting for his performance. His character doesn't talk as much as the protagonist (Parker), whose temperament is as cold as the ice around him when he taunts him about his sexuality. I felt more empathy towards (Gunther) plight and grieve stricken response to what befalls him , rooting for him to win the day , more so than (Parker) who despite losing his legs, acted as if he'd been subjected to watching paint dry.The story overall was good and worth a watch.",

Everyone knows the plot: Somebody killed my (insert loved one) so I'm going to kill him. Have we not seen this a thousand times? Is it really different when shot in the wilderness? I almost turned of the movie after the bear mauling scene. What troubled me about it is that a supposedly experienced hunter would be unaware that you have to flee if you see a bear knowing she has bear cubs, and if the bear attacks, you're supposed to lie still. Also from what I know an experienced hunter would be able to tell that a bear was in the vicinity and would leave.The movie improved in the last half because the action heated up and there was more dialogue. James Bryhan and Warren Hicks deserves an award for their acting skills. There was some minor drama involving a third character, who reminded me a lot of Forest Gump!

        "content": "This movie should have never been made. It is an utter travesty-an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has ever drawn breath and had the misfortune of clicking 'rent' or 'buy' on Amazon, or whatever unfortunate streaming service hosts this absolute dumpster fire of incoherence.Where to Even Begin?The Main Character's Deafness:\nWhy is the main character deaf? We are given no indication of how this is relevant to anything. Did they just throw in a deaf character and expect that alone to be \"interesting\"? Nope. There's no deeper significance or exploration-it's just there, pointlessly.His Life and Hunting Abilities (or Lack Thereof):\nWhat does this guy even do? His entire existence seems to revolve around wandering the woods with a pillowcase he inexplicably wants to fill with deer meat while his awful wife berates him. And this tent situation-he's in bear territory with a $60 Amazon tent that I also own? Unreal. Then there's his so-called \"backup gun\" that magically contains only one bullet. Are we seriously supposed to believe that this guy and his buddy have been hunting since childhood? Because they are terrible at it.The Music: A Whole New Level of AwfulThe score sounds like demo stock music you'd get for free in a digital audio workstation. It's completely misplaced in every scene, weirdly timed, and the volume levels are a disaster. Instead of adding tension or atmosphere, it actively ruins whatever little coherence the movie might have had.The Costuming: Beyond BadHis friend Fred wears a wig that looks like it was discarded from the set of Golden Girls. And when he puts a hat over it? It somehow looks worse, as if it's two entirely different hairpieces fighting for dominance.The Most Random Murder EverFred randomly shoots a woman in the forest. When this is revealed in the story, it's at such an odd moment that it barely registers. He's shown drinking and limping around for no real reason, but how does that lead to him suddenly killing someone? We don't even get a proper setup-no accidental shot, no aiming at something else. Just bang, dead. And despite being a relatively subdued character, he barely reacts to having just murdered a person.The Kidnapper's Mystical KnowledgeApparently, there's a whole backstory involving military service and a Native American kidnapper who somehow knows exactly who killed his wife. How does he know? The movie never explains. The audience is just expected to accept this absurdity with zero explanation.The Worst Kidnapping in Cinema HistoryThe ropes the kidnapper ties the main character up with are hilariously loose. The guy barely struggles, just kind of wiggles free in the most unconvincing way possible. How does the kidnapper keep getting surprised that his hostage escapes? Maybe tie the ropes tight next time, buddy.The Best Friend Character's Bizarre Non-ReactionAt one point, he notices that his kidnapped friend's car is driving around town. Does he react? Nope. Does he realize something is off? Who knows! The movie never clarifies, so we're left just as confused as he appears to be.Useless FlashbacksWe get flashbacks that serve no purpose whatsoever. Oh, his dad taught him how to hunt? Fascinating-except for the fact that he and his idiot drunk friend are terrible at it. And then, much later, we're suddenly told he has a military background? HA! That makes zero sense given his complete incompetence with firearms.The Pillowcase for Deer Meat-What?Who on earth uses a pillowcase to transport deer meat? Did anyone on the production team do any research on hunting? They centered the movie around it, yet it's clear they know absolutely nothing about it.The Laughably Bad PropsThe \"scary\" skull in the kidnapper's house is clearly plastic, with badly painted red splotches.There's a tombstone with what looks like random gibberish written on it-cheap, haunted-house-level garbage.The candles in the kidnapper's home are battery-operated, yet somehow have wax drips underneath them? Make it make sense.Every time someone presents a photo of someone else, it's printed on crumpled, wrinkled-up printer paper. Why? These people all have smartphones!The CGI Bear: A Masterpiece of AwfulnessThe bear attack is next-level terrible. The CGI makes the bear look like a brown carpet with teeth, writhing around on top of the main character in the least convincing way imaginable.The Ending: A Fittingly Stupid ConclusionThe movie ends just as pointlessly as it began. The utterly unredeemable wife accidentally kills her husband. Why? No reason, really. It's as if the filmmakers' entire message is: Life is just random, chaotic nonsense-deal with it.And why was she even looking for him? She wanted out of the relationship and was trying to sleep with his best friend. But sure, let's have her go searching for him just so she can conveniently be the one to kill him. It's just one last, gaping plot hole to top off the 999 others.Final ThoughtsThis movie is an absolute train wreck of incoherence, bad acting, laughable props, nonsense storytelling, and insultingly lazy filmmaking. The only thing it succeeds at is making you regret watching it. As a consolation, I had fun trash talking the movie the entire time to cope with a mixture of frustration and boredom.

It was of a much higher quality than I expected. Moreover, the acting was superb, played with earnestness. Megan Tremethick's performance was certainly a standout performance.The movie centred around power, family, dragons and betrayal. None of the characters were one dimensional, all of them had many layers and able to portray strength juxtaposed with vulnerability.For the budget they were able to pull off excellent choreographed fight scenes and superb animation was employed where the budget did not allow.A movie I will defiantly watch again, and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys medieval fantasy epics.",

Directed by Subodh, the film manages to shine in various aspects, including cinematography, production, set design, and music. Subodh's filmmaking style is evident throughout the film as he flexes his director's muscle successfully. The film's visual and auditory elements are crafted well, contributing significantly to its overall quality.However, there are certain portions where the film falls short. Some scenes missed the mark in creating the intended emotions, and others came across as over-dramatized or unintentionally funny. These moments detract slightly from the overall experience but do not overshadow the film's strengths.Despite these minor flaws, the film does justice to the original source material and conveys the plot smoothly. It honors the essence of Krushnaji Kadhilkar's story and brings it to life on the big screen in a commendable manner.In summary, \"Sangeet Manapman\" is a well-made film with strong technical aspects and a respectful adaptation of the original story. While it has its imperfections, it remains a worthy watch for fans of the classic tale and appreciators of Subodh's directorial prowess.",

        "content": "Sangeet Manapmaan, the iconic Marathi natak - a classic that's stood the test of time and will likely outlive us all. Remaking it into a film for the modern audience was always going to be ambitious, but here we are. The result? Well, let's just say it's a mixed bag.The first half of the film is an absolute treat. It's like stepping into a time machine but with better lighting and sound. The actors? Marvellous! Each one has embraced their role with gusto, and they rightly deserve a standing ovation. It's the kind of effort that would make even the original playwright crack a smile.But then comes the second half, and this is where things start to feel a tad, shall we say, creative. The filmmakers have taken liberties with the plot-so much so that at one point, it felt like watching Bahubali. The graphics and animations are fine, could have been done better maybe.The climax, however, is drawn-out, loses the momentum and feels slow. Still, if you're judging the film solely on the performances, it's a solid watch. The actors shine bright, and the music-oh, the music! Hats off to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy for their beautiful renditions, and the singers deserve a round of applause too.Now, if you were to ask your parents or fans of the original play, they might have mixed emotions about the adaptation. But such is the challenge of reimagining a classic - it's a bit like trying to modernise Shakespeare. Bold, but you'll always have someone pointing out that the original was better.All in all, it's worth a watch - just don't expect it to dethrone the original in your family's living room debates.",

        "title": "Iconic Marathi Play Comes to the Silver Screen with Dramaticism and Expressionism",
        "content": "Sangeet Manapmaan (2024) :\nMovie Review -Sangeet Manapmaan's story has lived for years and will continue to do so. Krishnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar introduced Manapmaan in 1911, and the story has transcended itself over the decades without credit. I can easily recall hundreds of old Hollywood, Bollywood, Tamil, and Telugu movies that have copied scenes from this original material, including modern mega blockbusters like Bahubali. Subodh Bhave decided to bring this heavyweight story to life again on the silver screen, only to achieve subpar results. Sangeet Manapmaan has some good moments, but it is dragged down by overly dramatic scenes and the utter expressionism that we witnessed in silent movies back in the 1910s-1920s, which we now see in daily soaps.Sangeet Manapmaan is a great story that beautifully mixes multiple themes such as love, ego, jealousy, courage, arrogance, honor, revenge, and humiliation. It begins with a simple lower-class man, Dhairyadhar (Subodh Bhave), who finds an expensive ornament belonging to the princess, Bhamini (Vaidehi Parashurami)z which he fails to return at that moment. The third side of this love triangle is formed by sub-commander Chandravilas (Sumeet Raghavan), who loves Bhamini and wants to marry her. Bhamini rejects his proposal, and the next moment her father suggests that she should consider Dhairyadhar, who has recently been taken as a soldier in the commander's army. High on the ego and arrogance of her beauty and wealth, Bhamini becomes furious with her father's suggestion and insults Dhairyadhar's mother. After calming down, when she goes to apologize to Dhairyadhar, he insults her in rage. Bhamini now must take revenge on Dhairyadhar by exposing his secret agenda, and for that, she disguises herself as a kitchen maid named Vanmala. Will she be proven right?Those who have seen the original play know that Manapmaan is more about Vanmala than Bhamini because it is only after becoming Vanmala that she realizes what Bhamini lacked. The first half hour of the film is filled with over-expressionism that does not suit modern cinematic standards. After an hour or so, things start to improve, and then the intermission comes at just the right time. The second half feels much better than the first half, but the finale is again dragged out and overly dramatic. For a moment or two, I couldn't believe that Subodh Bhave, who directed the masterpiece Katyaar Kaljat Ghusali, could make so many directorial mistakes while adapting another iconic musical play. He is not the only one to blame, but we must all accept that the story has become outdated for today's audience. Bhave was allowed to make those mistakes since the story was dated, but he could have modernized a few elements, which he failed to do. Even though it has lovable moments, one can't overlook the overly dramatic treatment of the narrative. Additionally, the overuse of sound design and background score further detracts from the viewing experience. In short, it's half a movie and half daily soap material.Subodh Bhave is such a lucky fella! First, he gets to portray q female role of Bhamini while playing Balgandharva on screen, and now he portrays Dhairyadhar in the movie, opposite the female role made memorable by Balgandharva. In my opinion, Dhairyadhar is the true hero of this tale. I'd like to disagree with a large portion of the audience, who have portrayed Bhamini as the true hero over the years. Dhairyadhar is smart, brave, and kind. He hasn't done a bad thing in his life, unlike every other character in the story. Bhave portrays him with honesty, but it's nowhere near his own standard. He played Sadashiv much better than this. Vaidehi Parashurami has a meaty role, but I can't really imagine anyone else playing Bhamini and Vanmala after knowing that Balgandharva has made it memorable with his elegance, beauty, and voice, despite being a man. Nevertheless, Vaidehi deserves a few words of appreciation for her dedication and sweetness in portraying this character. I liked her more as Vanmala than Bhamini, just as the writer envisioned while creating this character. Many actresses have played similar roles in countless rom-coms, screwball comedies, and such, so there wasn't really much substantial to carry. Sumit Raghavan and Upendra Limaye's negative roles stand out much better on many occasions, which is a significant achievement. Neena Kulkarni, Nivedita Saraf, Archana Nipankar, Shailesh Datar, and others have done decently.Sangeet Manapmaan lacks the musical magic of Katyaar, despite the same team. Thanks to Hrutu Vasant and some songs like \"Nahi Me Bolat,\" \"Mala Madan Bhase,\" and \"Shura Me Vandile\" from the original play that keep it afloat. The new original numbers should have been better. In the play, the songs are sung by the actors, so they cannot engage with the moving narrative. Here, playback makes it easy for Bhave and Parashurami to have their own moments of romance, love, dreams, and action. The action sequences here are poorly designed and fail to impress. In some scenes, the visual effects look grand and great, but the rest are strictly average. Shankar Mahadevan appears in a cameo and brings his magic yet again. I had high expectations from Subodh Bhave as a director, especially after what he achieved in his debut, Kartaar, but unfortunately, Sangeet Manapmaan didn't live up to my expectations. It's an okay project, but \"okay\" is not enough when you are adapting an iconic play, especially with such a good team and excellent production value. There has been a shift in audience preferences as well as our filmmaking since 2016, and the results are apparent to everyone. Today's audience doesn't really want to see any musicals. Katyaar got lucky that it came during the golden phase of Marathi cinema, and moreover, it was a great film. I doubt Manapmaan will come anywhere close to that!RATING - 5/10*",

He has extracted great performances from all and the movie keeps you interested. The music, performances, dialogues etc. Are top notch. The locales and internal sets are good. What lets down Subodh Bhave is Subodh Bhave the actor - he is good but he is just not the warrior type that was required in the film. At least he should have got fit for the role. By casting someone else he could have focused solely on direction and the film would have been a much better experience. He looks too old for a 35 year old character, not fit for an action role and is old for Vaidehi.The other let down is from producer Jyoti Deshpande and JIO - the budget just goes down as the film progresses! The cinematography is washed out, the action scenes are a joke with the same characters after getting killed come back to fill up the army (which is probably less than 50 odd). The sound mixing is also not on par so the songs which form the backbone of the film just do not come across as a concert experience. The songs seem to be muted overall; don't know if this was an Atmos mix.Overall Jio could have spend some more money on this production - technically the movie is below par and that robs the movie of its grandeur.Other performances are great - Vaidehi, Sumeet. Upendra Limaye seems to have come from the set of Animal - big dialogues but when it comes to enacting action scenes, he is seriously poor!Overall a good effort and look forward to see Subodh Bhave direct more and hope Vaidehi gets many more movies!",

        "title": "Lots of talking about non-threatening zombies",
        "content": "Just when I thought the zombie genre had been thoroughly bludgeoned dead-dead (thanks a lot, Walking Dead), along comes Didn't Die, a new film by Meera Menon which explores a post-apocalyptic world where people do a lot of talking. Sometimes about zombies, but mostly not. We've reached a post-modern zombie stage where every nuanced take on the undead has been tapped, so maybe all that's left is for survivors to just chat about their lives.The zombies (called \"biters\" here) barely pose any threat. For most of the apocalypse they only come out to feed at night, allowing the humans to go about their lives quite normally in the daytime. Recently however, they have begun to mutate and are appearing in daylight. Oh no.The movie centers around Vinita (Kiran Deol) who is the host of a \"podcast\" called Didn't Die, where the living can share their stories and discuss their feelings about living in a zombie apocalypse and what not.I kept wondering how people listen to a podcast without any infrastructure, but it is revealed later that it's actually a show broadcast over the radio. Then I kept wondering how a single person can manage to produce a radio broadcast without any infrastructure. And how did they print out a stack of flyers to promote the podcast? Look, I'm usually the guy who defends suspension of disbelief. Most of the genre films I watch demand it. But in a film that takes itself seriously and plays itself as a straight drama, I need to know a little about how they are able to power their electronics and charge a Tesla. Just a few rules of this world would help.It would have been fascinating if her \"podcast\" was simply a live performance with Vinita standing on a podium speaking to whoever happened to be there to hear her. The idea of clinging to our old ways in a new-normal environment is both poignant and disturbing.Thankfully, with 60 years of George Romero zombies, we already know how the undead and this genre works: 1) If you get bit, you will become one. 2) Destroy the brain. 3) The real threat is the living humans. Every film adds its own little twist, and in Didn't Die, we have a podcast to give us all the additional exposition we need, which isn't much other than the whole nighttime/daytime thing.Vinita is surviving with her insecure younger brother, who has somehow managed to survive without ever killing a zombie, and her older brother and his wife. Their existence is upended one day when Vinita's ex shows up with a baby he found and the gang has to wrestle with conflicting feelings and talk a lot about what to do with her.I guess the movie is something of a post-pandemic parable about how a horrific event can alter people's lives, long after the initial threat has passed. Much of the film is shot in black and white, giving it an arthouse vibe, although I'm not sure it really serves any purpose. All the actors do a great job portraying believable characters and delivering the dense dialog.At one point Vinita laments that if she repeats the name of her podcast over and over, \"didn't die\" becomes \"didn't I\", which suggests that the movie wants to explore regret. Vinita has a microphone and can say everything now that she wishes she had talked about before the world collapsed, but not a lot of people are around to hear her. I'll bet this would work well as a stage play.Didn't Die takes a swing at reimagining the zombie genre by stripping away the blood-soaked chaos to focus on human connection and introspection. However, if you're looking for a traditional horror/thriller, this film may disappoint-there are few tense moments, minimal blood or gore, and the undead rarely feel like a real threat. As a drama, the lack of coherent world-building and uneven pacing dilute its impact, leaving the film caught between arthouse drama and genre thrills.",

        "content": "Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.I appreciate when filmmakers are able to create a different approach to the zombie genre without feeding the same cliches and approaches. Meera Menon does offer some interesting concepts about having a podcast group during a zombie apocalypse. Despite some good camerawork and decent horror effects with the make-up and production, Menon seems to struggle on how to properly balance out the horror and dramatic tones together.Throughout, Menon tries to implement themes of grief and horror together. I do understand the intentions but the issue is that the characters focused on aren't interesting and you don't get a sense of fear or connection with them. Aside from poor dialogue and troubled pacing, the movie really drags along with an aimless point that feels like it lacks a purpose. Most of the performances were okay but it ranged with some not so good performances at times.The sound designs is okay as well with the score. It basically reminds me of \"Pontypool\" but unlike it being unique and creative, Menon seems to not understand how horror really works.In many ways, this movie could have worked, if only they had a better writing and direction.",

        "content": "\"Operation Hadal\" is another poor entry into the cinema, especially at Spring festival time which is supposed to be about cheer, happiness and family. Not War and terrorism. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes painfully evident that the movie is rife with significant flaws, particularly in the realms of camera shots and acting.The camera work in \"Operation Hadal\" is nothing short of a disaster. The underwater scenes, which should be the highlight of a submarine - based movie, are marred by extremely poor camera techniques. The use of a shaky camera during crucial moments is over - indulgent. For instance, when the submarines are engaged in a high - stakes chase, the constant jostling of the camera makes it nearly impossible to distinguish the movements of the vessels clearly. This lack of stability not only detracts from the visual spectacle but also confuses the audience, preventing them from fully grasping the intensity of the situation.Moreover, the editing of the camera shots is haphazard. The transitions between scenes are often jarring, with cuts that seem to have no logical flow. In one scene, the camera might abruptly switch from a close - up of a character's face to a wide - angle shot of the submarine's interior, disrupting the narrative rhythm. Compare this to the smooth and purposeful camera work in \"Das Boot\", a classic submarine movie. In \"Das Boot\", the camera movements are carefully choreographed to build tension and provide a sense of immersion. In \"Operation Hadal\", the disjointed camera work fails to create any such emotional connection or narrative coherence.The acting in \"Operation Hadal\" is another major downfall. The lead actors seem unable to fully inhabit their roles. Their line deliveries are often wooden and lack the emotional depth required for the story. For example, during a particularly tense moment when the crew faces a life - threatening situation, the actors' reactions come across as forced and insincere. There is a lack of genuine fear, determination, or camaraderie that one would expect in such a high - stress environment.The supporting cast fares no better. Their characters feel one - dimensional, and their performances lack the nuance to make them memorable. They seem to be going through the motions rather than truly engaging with the story. In a good military - themed film like \"Black Hawk Down\", the actors' performances are so powerful that they make the audience feel the weight of the soldiers' experiences. In \"Operation Hadal\", the weak acting fails to convey the gravity of the mission or the complexity of the characters' relationships.In conclusion, \"Operation Hadal\" disappoints greatly due to its shoddy camera work and subpar acting. These fundamental flaws overshadow any potential strengths the movie might have had, making it a far from a satisfying viewing experience. Add to the list of wolf warrior 1 and 2, operation red sea. And the other one that copied 13 hours the secret soldiers of Behgazi and you have a library of movies trying to send a message. Focus on good story telling and not the message. Learn from the mistakes of Hollywood that is literally falling down now.",

        "content": "Because of 'Operation Red Sea', I am very much looking forward to this movie and have high expectations. But after reading it, I still had some disappointment, mainly due to the chaotic narrative and incorrect props for weapons and equipment. But it doesn't prevent this from being an excellent war movie.The theme is very novel, making bold innovations and breakthroughs among numerous submarine themed films, presenting a thrilling deep-sea battle. The submarine scene is a masterpiece in visual presentation, with ultimate realism and shock. The movie finely and accurately reproduces the interior of the \"Dragon Whale\" submarine, and uses a series of long shots to showcase the internal structure, which is highly visually impactful, as if one were in a real submarine, experiencing the complex structure and tense atmosphere inside the submarine. In the scene of submarine warfare, the realistic restoration of the deep sea environment allows the thrilling plot to be vividly presented, filling the tense atmosphere. It's like being in a submarine command cabin, following the plot through the ups and downs of the deep sea, truly experiencing the thrilling deep-sea confrontation. The scene of torpedo warfare is even more exciting, with a fast-paced combat rhythm that is vividly simulated through special effects, bringing a strong visual impact.The action scenes are also very grand, from intense gunfights on the drilling platform to underwater gunfights when the Jiaolong assault team dives into enemy submarines; The shocking rescue efforts to prevent nuclear explosions at the enemy's \"Sun Base\" and \"Moon Base\" were filled with tension and passion, reflecting the tense atmosphere of the battle. Moreover, there are also depictions of future weapons, such as the single soldier aircraft used during the rescue of the drilling platform at the beginning and the enemy's mechanical dog at the end, which bring a novel perspective. Especially in the final fight scene, the addition of \"B-level film\" elements makes the scene appear more violent and tense. The explosion effect is very realistic, and the tense atmosphere can be felt through the screen.In contrast, the plot of the film appears slightly dull. Although the movie adopts a multi line parallel narrative structure, this narrative style increases the complexity and hierarchy of the story to a certain extent, allowing one to feel the tension and excitement of this deep-sea battle from different perspectives. The pace is somewhat slow, the plot is very simple, and there is basically no narrative in the early stages, which makes one feel tired. But the character descriptions in the movie are all commendable, adding a lot of color to the film.Overall, this is a film with both advantages and disadvantages. It has certain highlights in narrative structure, character shaping, visual presentation, and thematic expression, but at the same time, there are also some shortcomings. As a sequel to Operation Red Sea, it has to some extent continued the style and quality of its predecessor, but has not achieved a qualitative breakthrough. In the future creation of military action films, directors and screenwriters should pay more attention to the rationality and logic of the story, avoiding excessive pursuit of visual effects and neglecting the quality of the story itself.",

Theaters in Australia and India were completely empty on day one, and by day two, most screenings were canceled due to zero audience turnout. This isn't just a flop; it's a movie that never even existed in the eyes of the public.The cast and crew did their best, but their talent was completely wasted by an inexperienced and unskilled director who had no business making a feature film. The storytelling is nonexistent, the pacing is unbearable, and the overall execution feels like a half-baked student project with no sense of filmmaking craft.Sadly, you might see some positive reviews, but those are likely from people involved in the project who had no choice but to support it. If there was any real merit to this film, it would have lasted longer in theaters, and at least some media outlets would have talked about it. Instead, it vanished overnight, leaving no impact whatsoever.With no audience, no buzz, and no real cinematic value, Anaganaga Australia Lo is nothing but a boring, unwatchable mess.

His associate also deserves praise for adding depth and authenticity to their interactions. Madan stands out with a powerful and nuanced performance, bringing a strong impact to his role. Sia delivers a commendable act-her confidence and grace do not make her seem like a newcomer at all. Ram plays his part with conviction, adding to the film's overall realism.The drug lord's character is another surprise package. He delivers his role with remarkable ease and conviction, making a strong impression.Direction & Execution:For a debutant, Taraka Rama has shown great potential as a director. He has been able to convey the essence of the story in his own unique style. However, aspects like editing, dialogues, and screenplay structure could have been tighter to enhance engagement. While the film had all the right ingredients for a gripping thriller, a well-trimmed version of around 2 hours 10-15 minutes would have made it more commercially viable and impactful.Perhaps, the director's deep passion for the story led to certain sequences being retained that could have been edited out for a sharper narrative. The intro scene with the guys stepping out for a smoke felt unnecessary and slightly dull, making for a slow opening. A more engaging start would have added to the film's appeal.Inspiration & Style:There's an evident inspiration from cult Hollywood films, especially Pulp Fiction, in how Anand and Milind characters are written and portrayed. This adds an interesting dynamic, giving the film a stylish and intense feel.Final Thoughts:Despite a few areas that could have been improved, Anaganaga Australia Lo is a commendable effort, and every actor brings freshness to the screen. If the film undergoes a refined editing process, it has the potential to reach a wider audience with a greater impact.Best wishes to all the actors and the team-there is immense talent here, and I look forward to seeing more from them in the future!",

The plot revolves around the heroine, a student at Melbourne University, and the gripping incident that changes her life. It's a classic cat-and-mouse game that delivers thrills and surprises, especially in the unexpected climax involving the three main characters.Rishi, who plays Mathan, shines in his role with a commendable performance.

The actors also looked perfect for their roles.The first half felt very slow, making the film drag especially the detectives scenes. But the hero and heroine brought life back in the second half with their strong performances and good chemistry. The bond between the detectives didn't click well affecting the flow of movie. The man from India did his part well. Comedy felt outdated.The pub song added to the lag, making the movie feel longer than needed. Trimming the detective scenes and keeping the runtime to 120 min would have made a big difference.The other actors did their jobs well, but the editing could have been smoother. Weak sound design also pulled the film down. If the length had been tighter, with sharper editing and fewer dialogues, this could have been a much better movie. Over all its not a bad movie!!!",

        "content": "On February 28, the movie \"100 Dni do matury\" appeared in cinemas, and a day later I decided to go to the screening, mainly to shape my opinion as much as possible without being influenced by the opinions of others (especially critics) and I was surprised. First of all, let me say that it wasn't as bad as I expected.The film is very enjoyable to watch even though it lasts approximately two hours. Maybe sometimes there are moments that are a bit more boring, but actually time is not his biggest problem.While watching it, there was even a moment when I thought that it was a good movie, and I was even inclined to give it a \"6\" rating, which was a really big surprise for me. However, in the last 30 minutes (from the moment one of the characters appears in the nursing home), the entire action accelerates, which has various consequences. On the one hand, it helps the comedy side of the film - the jokes are finally starting to work (well, maybe not all of them), and on the other hand, the plot exceeds all limits of absurdity, leaves us with something to say, throws in stupid (to put it mildly) dialogues and rushes to the end. I was very curious how the creators would end the film and I think it could have looked better than Przemek Pro's morals. I would even watch 30 minutes more just to see a better developed ending. It's a pity, because until the climax the movie was quite enjoyable for me. Now maybe something about the cast, because I'm sure most people went to the cinemas just for it. We have some well-written characters in the film and the creators also try to show their transformation. Mr. Jacek Koman did great, but the characters played by Ms. Malgorzata Foremniak and Mr. Piotr Glowacki were also very good to watch. However, those played by famous YouTube creators are more diverse. Bartosz Laskowski is good in the main role, or at least I wasn't offended by his acting. Similarly with Hania Puchalska, Pola Sieczko, Julita Rozalska and episodes of other famous influencers (of whom Michal Werminski probably made the best use of his moment in the film). Bartek Kubicki (who is saved by comedy elements), Dominik Kwolczak and Patryk Baran were average viewership. However, my biggest problem is with Kinga Banas, who sometimes plays very poorly, but sometimes she is great (especially in the more \"angry\" lines).Now that we have discussed the cast and the idea for the film, it's time for the rest. The music is okay, the \"Trzech Kroli\"'s song is really good, catchy and fits the movie nicely. The photos aren't the worst, sometimes they're good, sometimes they're average. The scenography (apart from the school and the Apike building) is good. Likewise the costumes, although these are better for the adult characters.Referring to the words of the theme song: \"(...) I have satisfaction (...)\", I have to say that not entirely. I really feel sorry for the ending, because the rest was quite good. The cast even did well, especially the guard of experienced actors. Considering the last 30 minutes, I have to lower my rating, unfortunately.",

Father has just been shot by the evil warlord who sneers evilly and of course is blind in one eye - because how could you have a villian who is not physically disfigured, just as how could you have a heroine or hero who are not young and good-looking? Speaking of our young good-looking hero, here he is, entering right on cue with a meet-cute.Much doe-eyed flirting ensues, punctuated by an unending stream of shootings, explosions, scalding, stabbing, with loud dramatic music indicating crescendo after crescendo. Lots of shooting, large and small caliber weapons, auto and semi-automatic, revolvers and rifles. See people jump off a cliff. See computer graphic 1920s trains steaming through digitally produced snow. See a locomotive explode. See a train steaming through snow. See an iceboat on Lake Baikal. The train is still steaming through that snow. You've got your pick of period small arms if you have that interest. I didn't. Did I mention there is a train traveling through Siberian snow?The plotline is straightforward - Team Good Guys must transport Super Secret Information from China to Moscow, and Team Bad Guys try to stop them. But wait! Is there A Traitor?? Our heroes have caught The Villian. Or have they?? If the viewer is aged under about 14 there may be surprises, but likely not - the \"twists\" here are telegraphed to the viewer and you have seen this storyline before. Many times before.

        "title": "Guy Ritchie for the poor",
        "content": "What happens if you try to repeat the style of Guy Ricci, take the plot of Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and try to play it up with the sauce of \"Faster than a Bullet\"? It sounds interesting, but in reality... But first things first.I very rarely go to the cinema to watch Russian films. That's how they have proven themselves. Unfortunately, a new experience confirmed my fears. But that's not the point now. I decided to give this film a chance, although I already saw from the trailer an obvious carbon copy of the work about Hercule Poirot. And what did I see? Let's be honest, first about the obvious advantages of the film.Pros:Acting. I can't say anything bad about this aspect, quite the opposite. Milos Bikovic is charming and good. He plays effortlessly and you want to believe him. Gleb Kalyuzhny, Zheng Hanyi, Gosha Kutsenko and Huang Haonan also did well. These actors really tried! And, frankly, without Bikovic and Kalyuzhny this film would be impossible to watch.Visuals. The picture really looks expensive and spectacular in places. A couple of action scenes look cheap (at the level of Hollywood of the late 90s), but spectacular. But this, unfortunately, concerns only a small share of scenes.Alas, that's where the pros end. Now let's list the obvious cons.Cons:Elena Podkaminskaya. Her performance reminded me of Cate Blanchett's character from \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\" Everyone remembers how caricatured and stupid that character looked? It's exactly the same here. Constant overacting and strained delivery. That's all there is to the least interesting character in this film.Directing. I will highlight this aspect especially, because Andrey Volgin decided to jump above his head. It is not the first time he tries to copy the style of Western filmmakers, but this time he took aim at Guy Ricci. I am not exaggerating. Remember the mind-blowing scene from Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows in the forest? Now imagine that a person saw it, told it to his friend, the friend told it, being drunk, to his girlfriend, the girlfriend to your grandmother, and the grandmother to your grandfather, and he to you. What came out in the end is this very scene from Andrey Volgin's creation, chewed over five times and only a pale parody. And there are a lot of such \"borrowings\" here! Hand-held shooting, slow-mo, quick editing, object tracking, tracking stabilization and object (character) tying. Everything that Ricci uses, Volgin also tries to use clumsily. And no, Mr. Ricci does not have an unconditional patent right to it. But if you are going to copy, then do it well, not like that.The script. An incredibly lazy plot, with a certain MacGuffin that everyone is running after (or with) from the beginning to the end of the film. And no, like with the painting from RocknRolla or the suitcase from Pulp Fiction, we are not told the full value of this object. But in the cases mentioned, it was artistically and cleverly played out. And here? What kind of documents? Why are they needed? What are they capable of? Gentlemen, these are not infinity stones capable of destroying the universe. And not a list of all spies behind enemy lines. This is simply a list of names. Which ones? Why? Who? Don't expect an answer to this question. We are being made to understand in no uncertain terms that this was a list of all oppositionists to the new People's Republic of China, then I would understand why the Soviets and the PRC need it, but why do the Japanese need it, who does the shadow villain work for (a twist for the sake of a twist)? The whole plot is sewn with white threads and literally falls apart when you try to clarify anything. Deliberately complicated and pretentious, it tries to be clever, but it doesn't work.There are still many minuses, like unremarkable music, weak special effects. And don't complain about the budget. $8 million. This is a good budget for Russian cinema. Let me remind you that \"Godzilla: Minus One\" cost $15 million. And won an Oscar for best visual effects.I still believe in Russian cinema. But \"Red Silk\" only added new doubts rather than increased my faith.5 out of 10.",

That first film, Legacy of Thorn, definitely has its charms, but the difference between that and Wrath of Thorn is night and day, and is clearly the work of an incredibly talented filmmaker who has honed his craft over the years. Someone I watched this with described it as being like a Paul W. S. Anderson Resident Evil movie crossed with post-2005 Doctor Who, which is incredibly accurate (positive), though the thing it brought to mind most for me personally was the Phantasm films, especially the increasingly apocalyptic sequels.It was lovely to be able to meet MJ and several other members of the cast and crew at Horror-on-Sea, and I'm totally going to play favourites - the \"Mycho\" flicks at this year's Horror-on-Sea were overall some of the best stuff I saw all weekend. The red levels on the sound mix for this screening must have been nuts, which is my one minor technical nitpick, but to be honest some of that's gotta be chalked up to the difficulties of hosting a horror fest in a hotel ballroom.",

        "content": "Upon returning to Avondale, a woman's attempts to reconcile with her parents bring her into contact with the cult that protects the inhuman killer Thorn who's out to continue honoring the pact that initially brought him to the town and band together with several others to stop it from continuing.Overall, this was an immensely fun conclusion to the trilogy. Among the better features of this one stem from the inclusion of various elements here that help to build up the full purpose of the killer's reign and purpose in the city. That this one goes back and manages to introduce the original ceremony that summoned Thorn to the area and gives why his rampages are centered around Leap Day or the specific family he's been targeting the entire time that helps to tie everything together is a great way to go about this. The reason why the cult initially brought him about and what he was intended to do is a nice touch here which comes about with the inclusion of the various characters from the past to inform the commando team protecting the latest target about what's happening which is not only proves to be a solid singular storyline anyway but also gives the full meaning to everything that's happened so far into context. Outside of that, there's still a lot of fun to be had with the traditional stalking scenes on display. The flashback scene showing the cult preparing the ceremonial summoning of the hulking killer and putting everything in motion is a fine start, while the scene where the daughter returns to meet up with her family that goes for the series of chases and interactions with the cult chasing after them has a few fun bits of action included. The commando team encountering the supernatural antics of the cult are also really enjoyable, with the spectacular scene with them impaired by a blinding sandstorm hiding his attacks or the great encounter at the abandoned school where they encounter the killer and the cult minions once again giving this a solid enough series of encounters featuring more of an Action-movie bent based on the types of stalking scenes featured here. With the hulking killer still looking quite impressive and managing to get some creative and bloody kills involved, there's plenty to like here despite some factors holding it back. The main drawback to the film is a bit of a weak finale that manages to go for a more mystical-inspired way of defeating the killer that comes off quite awkwardly. The whole idea of waiting around for certain participants to get involved at first halts the tempo and pacing significantly while the action presented tends to be quite confusing and scattered when it's finally time to get started with the ritual. With way too many participants around with their own agendas to carry out during the fight, it can get a habit hard to tell who's doing what for what purpose, and introducing the concept of mystical powers and sacred artifacts does detract slightly from the more grounded aspects the rest of the series had employed. The other slight issue is the naturally obvious low budget at points, whether it's the CGI or effects-work that gives itself away, but are thankfully not as detrimental to this one.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

Very realistic to real life situations in the hood. The group who created this was the realist that you can ever see. Once I press play, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I understand it's a low budget movie but the story was mind driven. The actors were amazing. They didn't overact, it was natural. Everything felt realistic. I'm telling you, watch it. You won't regret it. If you feel different, I respect it.",
