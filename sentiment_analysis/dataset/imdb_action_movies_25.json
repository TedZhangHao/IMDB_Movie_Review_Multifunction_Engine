        "content": "Daredevil was without any doubt the best thing ever to come out of MCU, along with The Punisher. I'm also a huge fan of d'Onofrio, who managed to portray one of the (if not the) best ''super''villain on TV. I've been cautiously optimistic ever since the announcement of its return, but now it's finally here and...Rushed plot. Scenes and dialogue seem cut short. Too much cramped in 1 episode, resulting in a lack of suspense and character building. Fight scenes seem slowish and at times even silly as if they're cuddling. It's just trying way too hard to match the original, but failing miserably. The production just feels cheap overall, cutting corners all-over. Even the soundtrack and effects seem rushed.I really wanted it to continue on with the level of quality from the originals, but it simply doesn't. The ratings and reviews here are once again ridiculous. It seems people's standards have been lowered to such an extend that they truly don't know any better any more, or they simply can't afford themselves to feel disappointed. Not that it's bad, but it's quite evident Disney just can't seem to do any thing other than destroy and dumb down. Having some extra violence and blood still doesn't save you from a lack of substance. I really can't be bothered watching any further, it's just that stale compared to the originals.",

Compared to the contrast/shadow heavy, dark and colorful cinematography of the «original» seasons.Marvel have obviously been struggling since Avengers Endgame, and like most of the movies and especially tv shows (except for Loki), this is not surprisingly another disappointing Disney+ product.I hope it somehow can surprise me and develop a good plot/story over the next few episodes. But when it comes to the overall production of the show its been fairly disappointing, so far..7/10 (could change)",

Matt Murdock's internal struggles and moral dilemmas are portrayed with depth, making his journey compelling. The narrative also explores the intricate relationship between Murdock and Fisk, adding layers to the storytelling.The return of key characters, including Deborah Ann Woll as Karen Page and Elden Henson as Foggy Nelson, enriches the narrative, providing continuity and depth to the storyline.",

First of all, I'm super glad to get the cast and characters back on screen. But that's about it. It was really difficult to watch. The editing is all over the place with lots of fast cuts, and using way too much low-quality CGI for even small fight scenes or even swinging around, when before they used to have talented stunt work and beautiful cinematography and intense fight choreography that was often shot in one take. Also, now the camera quality seems lower quality, the lighting is way too bright for night scenes, and the set designs look like low budget stages instead of stunning on-location shots like they used to do. The dialog seems very choppy and rushed as well, like the cuts are very obvious, whereas before it was more paced and realistic. Pretty much everything I loved about the original series is gone, the only saving grace is the wonderful original cast. I'll keep watching and hoping it gets better, but honestly with Disney+'s reputation with their Marvel shows, I'm not getting my hopes up.",

There had never been a comic series that came like it before that captivated more than most full length films did or still do. For my taste it was the best thing in the Marvel universe to ever come out. The grittiness , the sheer brutality, and heart of the characters made it shine brighter than anyone could've imagined.When Disney acquired Marvel, the show was put on a hiatus along with all the other Netflix marvel series. No one knew if we'd see this brilliant version of daredevil and punisher again. Thankfully they made the right choice and brought them both back and I can honestly say once again, it has reignited the MCU in much needed fashion.It starts off where it ended with such a fluidity and continuation of quality. It's actually uncanny how close they managed to come. All the actors are still top-notch and on top of their game. The characterization is just so impeccably written it's flabbergasting. With an even bigger budget, the action sequences, and overall dynamo has been upped to insane levels. The level of production quality on this is truly mind blowing. Even though we're only two episodes and it's safe to say that we have definitely been born again into witnessing greatness in the MCU after a long time of not. I cannot wait to see what else happens this season and cannot wait what they do with the punisher project that will follow..",

Too much CGI, terrible fight sequences, and incredibly unrealistic situations - AND they throw out his whole inner battle within the first 20 minutes - like the whole basis for what and who Daredevil is gets tossed off a roof in the first act!See for yourself - like you owe it that much - but if you're like me and you were a real fan of what the first three seasons offered, you'll know - just like me - within the first 20 minutes that this is NOT the Daredevil we deserve.

It's watchable, Charlie Cox is amazing once again, but they just kill everything with shotty CGI, bad choreography, they just packed a lot of things in very short amount of time that should have been amazing, but the old show would have given time for these events, would have had build up, reason, but here things just happen, don't ask questions, just consume product and get excited for the next product. I'm happy overall that they made this, but generally pretty dissapointing start.Now 7 episodes in, just give it a chance ! I will die on the hill that Netflix did a better job, but it becomes a worthy succesor, it really does get better, so much better ! Worth watching !",

While not as good as seasons 1, or 3, it's easily comparable to the show overall and stands on its own two feet.The pacing is much faster than the original show which took some getting used to, but considering the shorter 9-episode format and the fact that the show is catching us up to the present timeline it's a welcome addition to the content.The cinematography of the show is one of the best upgrades. Visually, it's beautiful and you can tell they really put their whole souls into this.Charlie Cox and Vincent put their entire hearts into their performances and they do not disappoint whatsoever.Brilliant.",

The production is surprisingly not as good and reshoots are noticeable, even though the budget is probably much higher than the original pilot from 2015. Editing, pacing, musical score/ soundtrack and CGI are all over the place. The CG Daredevil swinging building to building is distracting, as opposed to the grounded practical look of the original. Combat between DD and a character just doesn't feel as well done. I need to remind myself this is made by an almost completely new team at Disney as opposed to Netflix. There are GREAT character moments in this first episode, but some moments are rushed. I still have hope this can be a good show. I LOVE Daredevil, as I gave the original show a 9.1/10 overall.

But it turns out they really haven't. It's the same story as before-they were meant to die, and while they might not show it explicitly, they likely hired the actors just to kill off their characters.As for the plot, it seems like they'll take the first six episodes to bring Daredevil back and to set up Fisk's downfall. It'll probably end with a big battle between Daredevil and Fisk, with Spider-Man showing up since Spider-Man 4 is in the works. Way to kill off a solid character for barely any reason, Marvel.

We've always known there was a psycho side to Fisk. Now that he has been elected mayor of NYC, there could be significant damage levied by a political powerful person with massive rejection issues. Vincent D'Onofrio has stepped up his acting chops and plays Fisk less as a comic book villain and more like true-life, modern-day nightmare.After only two episodes, I am unsure if I like this version of Daredevil better than the one from the past.

It's just not how fights work, as opposed to the incredibly well done realism of the first show.Also, I thought the Karen Page \"arc\" was very poorly handled, with the show telling us things instead of showing them - \"Remember when you wouldn't talk to me? Remember when you went away for a year?\"Also, the scene with Matt and his \"blind date\" was directed as if the show had suddenly become a rom-com, cutting out the dialogue and going into a montage of brief shots of Matt and his date talking and laughing together. It was tonally completely out of place.Even the handling of Wilson Fisk was fumbled - his face was out of focus for some reason in his first two scenes, then he just sort of shambles into the room where the \"five families\" are meeting and everyone shambles out of the room. They don't establish his character (or anyone else's come to think of it) in any meaningful way. He's just sort of there mumbling things.His meeting with Matt was alright, but they failed to build any real tension, instead just tagging narrative bases like a paint-by-numbers story.Which is kind of the Disney way of doing things, so I don't know what else I was expecting.And it's a pale shadow of the comic book it's named after, which is another regular Marvel flaw, as in \"Age of Ultron\" in which there was no Age of Ultron, or Civil War, in which there was no war.It's a shame, because they had all the pieces in place.

You've never seen Jason Statham in a movie like this before... is something I won't be saying about 'A Working Man' or probably any future Statham movie. You can easily fill in the all too familiar blanks. Jason is an ex____ who has put those days behind him. Now he must return to his old ways and rescue _____ while kicking the bad guys asses along the way.The first act bolts out of the gate at a rapid pace, so fast in fact, I thought I was watching the trailer.A lot of the dialogue was inaudible, maybe because of the British people doing bad American or Russian accents. Which would explain why most of the film was trying to pass off England as Chicago.I was never sure if it was being played for laughs, with sudden dramatic head turns and theatrical musical stings. Making it all feel a bit camp - especially when the villains are dressed as vampires or like they've fallen into a lost property box.Thanks to co-screenwriter Sylvester Stallone, you're pummelled with cliche after cliche, desperately trying to emulate the classic action movies of the 80's but missing the target by a mile. The unintentionally funny scenes do deliver some laugh out loud moments which make the experience more bearable. I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting to be more entertained than I was.So, If you enjoy Statham being Statham and aren't in the mood for something new, then by all means, knock yourself out and give this a go.Nick@WatchItWombat.",

It's formulaic, filled with odd characters who feel right out of a Netflix movie, and in very few ways entertains. David Harbour and Michael Pena are barely in the film, obviously there for the paycheck. Ayer is far from his Fury days, directing mostly from handheld, so every scene has an unnecessary amount of shaking. And then there's the odd mishmash of different inspirations it draws from: it wants to have the deep backstory of John Wick along with its fashion sense. It even borrows elements from Nosferatu if you can believe it. Statham is once again playing half of his talents, locked up in a story co-written by Stallone, which might explain some of its whackier elements. I'd wait to see A Working Man until it hits digital as it's just too weird and so poorly acted, but be prepared to wonder afterwards if you wasted two hours of your life taking a chance on this utter disappointment.",

There was no captivating story behind all this. The \"do you have a daughter\" felt so forced the whole time.The acting in general sucked. The plot made no sense and was full with clichés. There was no character development whatsoever.Why are the bad guys always Russian? Why did the first guy in the movie got beaten? Why do the parents just sit around and do nothing? Done know why your wife got killed?

Very much in vogue: a young, smart and powerful woman who was placed at his side so that the male audience wouldn't fall asleep.The only thing missing was for him to catch the flying bullets with his teeth. So, for a possible second part, one could add more. For the faint-hearted, the film exudes a fair amount of cultural pessimism. The theme of \"I scare you, and then I'm the hero who saves you\" is inherent in American films. As such, the plot is rather one-dimensional and not for people who prefer a more complex way of thinking.

I could probably write a book about all the dumb things that are said in this movie, but I'll just give one: When a mother's daughter is kidnapped by a Russian crime mob, the police tell her \"they don't pursue these cases.\" Ok well, I guess vigilante justice is our only option then.",

This time, they dive into the dark world of human trafficking, and the result is a relentless action thriller that pulls no punches. In his usual no-nonsense fashion, Statham dishes out swift and brutal justice, making every fight sequence feel personal and punishing.Scripted by Sylvester Stallone and based on Chuck Dixon's Levon's Trade (the first of 12 excellent, fast-paced books which I recommend - they are short novels with lots of action), the film sets the stage for what could be a long-running franchise. Statham's character, Levon Cade, is a former black ops operative trying to live a quiet life- until evil finds him first. One of the film's most memorable moments comes when Cade warns a trafficker, \"You had your chance to walk away. Now I take everything.\" Moments later, the audience is treated to a bone-snapping, full-throttle takedown that leaves no doubt: he means it.Ayer's signature grit and Stallone's old-school action sensibilities make A Working Man more than just another Statham beatdown; it's a raw, relentless tale of vengeance and justice. If this is only the beginning, action fans should buckle up for the ride ahead. Don't listen to the naysayers; this is a great old-school meets new-school action popcorn flick.",

        "title": "In an action movie, the star will always be above the script.",
        "content": "When it comes to a film starring an action star, things like an excellent script or a good story are somewhat irrelevant, and it's a fact that you can make a very enjoyable film without the need for those elements, unless you want to raise the stakes. Jason Statham's films are no exception, and most of his films simply seek to offer a pleasant dose of action for action movie fans. A Working Man is an action thriller adapted from an obscure novel titled Levon's Trade, which Sylvester Stallone himself was interested in adapting. It was initially planned as a television series, but was later changed to a feature film, condensing the original story and adapting it into a conventional action film.This film takes on some typical action thriller clichés, such as kidnapping, trafficking, the Russian mafia, and an ex-soldier returning to the battlefield. The opening credits sequence explains without much fuss who Levon was, and at the beginning of the film, it's clear that he's a former soldier who just wants a normal life. We see that things aren't going well for him, having lost his wife, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and his father-in-law doesn't consider him fit to take care of little Merry. Levon is a man who, by chance, returns to combat when he has to rescue Jenny after she's been kidnapped. The rest of the film is no different from Taken, as Levon uses his cunning to find Jenny. The film focuses heavily on suspense and intrigue at the beginning, and the action later becomes more evident when Levon must use force to confront his opponents. The film doesn't give much information about the Russian mafia and only drops a couple of hints that it's a powerful organization. This represents a great challenge for Levon and could offer something very fascinating to explore. The script certainly isn't excellent, but that's made up for with the action scenes. Some are very brief, but most are promising. The action is what matters most and is what makes a Jason Statham film worthwhile. Here, it's clear that Stallone has decided to pass the mantle to Statham, and it's something that was expected since they worked together on The Expendables. Although there's no denying that with The Transporter, Statham proved he was destined to be an action star. This film might not have worked without Jason Statham, so he's the one who saves the film in the same way he did with The Meg.A Working Man may not be one of Jason Statham's best films, but it's still a pretty enjoyable film. That's something only true fans of Jason Statham or action movies will appreciate. It's a film that can't be measured by its writer, but by all the action moments where it's always nice to see Statham being the action hero he's always been. My final rating for this film is 8/10.",

You'll just get repeatedly stung here.This carbon copy movie of all other Jason Statham films also reminded me of the long list of Steven Seagal and Liam Neeson cookie cutter films. So, as a positive, if you love those Leave-Your-Brain-at-the-Door action/revenge/justice films, this 1,516th version is for you!Terminator Statham successfully left his expert military life behind him until the Russian Mob (is there another kind?) took his boss's daughter. What is he to do? Oh, yeah, John Wick/Bryan Mills/The Transporter himself to get the girl back.What sucked about this version of the same ole story was the disgustingly bad editing. I would absolutely expect this in a later Seagal or Sylvester Stallone film where they're either out of shape to be the same perfect martial artist or simply too old. Here we barely saw ANY of the action with the film's quick edits/zoom-ins.Jason Statham does NOT appear to be that old and definitely not carrying a Thor Dadbod. I know he's not Transporter 1 age, but I'm sad to not at least see some incredible Statham action, choreographed scenes.The movie sported unintentionally hilarious outfits, clichés aplenty, a story so predictable you have the movie pegged at minute 1 and the movie's climax ends abruptly with a laugh-out-loud scream. And what was with the victim who was never introduced as a Lara Croft fighter, suddenly able to Black Widow herself out of many situations?That all said, it wasn't the worst I'd ever seen. Of the rare action scenes that zoomed out, they were fun. And all that unintentional laughter did add to the enjoyment.Totally not recommended, but it could've been a lot worse. Still, this working man needs to be unemployed.***Final Thoughts: I watch a YouTube channel where they always comment on \"the Bruce Almighty Moon\" whereas whenever the moon appears huge on screen, it's as if Jim Carrey's God-Character pulled it in. I have never, EVER seen the moon look this big in ANY movie, including Bruce Almighty or even Moonfall. It's as if finding the girl was the least bit of worry for everyone in this universe. That moon, that looked like it was about collide with Earth, probably should've been the real threat.",

Jason Statham seldom disappoints in an action thriller, I'm a fan of his so was always likely to get the required fun out of this.Statham is great, naturally without him the movie would be vastly less entertaining. Away from the former British diver (still can't quite believe that's the same guy!), there are too many characters - which is one of the issues I have. There didn't need to be so many peeps in this.Even so, those onscreen are all decent enough and none register as overt negatives in my mind. David Harbour does well in a small role, he usually speaks the same way in roles but this feels minorly different. Michael Peña and Arianna Rivas are solid, as is Jason Flemyng.The latter's character should've be the only bad guy in this, or at least one of a few. He gives enough that we didn't need anyone else in my opinion, especially as 'higher-ups' Andrej Kaminsky and Maximilian Osinski give weaker performances. Chidi Ajufo is the best of the rest.My other issue lies with the run time. I guess with so many characters it did need to be almost two hours in length, however you could've told this story within 90 minutes without a doubt. But again, as noticeable as that and the other issue is, it at least doesn't hinder much for me.",

When the daughter of a close friend vanishes however, he find himself returning to the skills that made him a quote 'mystic figure in the shadowy world of counter-terrorism'.If Taken, John Wick, or Equaliser came to mind during the opening paragraph, then you would be correct in finding the glaring similarities to each of these franchises. The major differences are that A Working Man comes well over a decade too late, and lacks any possible depth or subtlety. That being said, switch off your brain and this is an adequate action thriller, complete with wince-worthy kills, terrific action, and some witty one liners. The star-studded cast bring up some of the funniest moments, including Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels legend Jason Flemyng, who delivers a lovingly stereotypical Russian mob boss, and Statham himself, who fits into the role of Levon like a comfy pair of slippers.

His movies are usually intense brutal action scenes, gritty storylines and highly entertaining.

I will give this movie an overall rating 9/10. The story line is good but simple but what makes this movie good is the screenplay and the action scenes were done extremely well. Im not sure if there was any CGI used but cinematically everything looked good and real. Also the dialoque was quite good.

Now that premise would be fine if the execution of it is top notch. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this film that you haven't seen done 10x better in 1000 other films throughout the 80's, 90's and 2000's. Villains that are boring, forgettable and barely developed. I couldn't tell you what Statham's character's name was in the film as the film never makes it important for you to know it. The story never takes any real risks or surprised me. You have both good guys and bad guys that INSITS that they are more badass then they really are. There are things in the story like warring factions or secret societies pulling strings that are clearly taken from the world building of John Wick and yet it is either barely explained or poorly executed. Where John Wick reminded audiences of the importance of well choreographed action with good cinematography to follow it and editing that lets a scene breath and naturally flow from one to the next, the action in this film is edited all over the place. Many of the actions scene are done through editing which when they are not jarring, they feel sloppy and you can't grasp what is going on. If John Wick is the Glass of Refined Aged Whisky and a well crafted meal, A Simple Man is the Burgers, Fries and cheap beer version.",

Once again, he's playing squarely to his strengths and it's seriously impressive how him playing this type of character for the umpteenth time doesn't feel anywhere near as stale as when his fellow contemporaries stay in their respective lanes.David Ayer's direction isn't as strong as his efforts in last year's The Beekeeper whilst keeping the film consistently visually slick despite a couple of weird creative flourishes. The action is unexpectedly choppy when also compared to Ayer and Statham's last collaboration, saved by the stuff that's still easy to see and a wild action packed finale.

The film is produced and co written by Sylvester Stallone and stars Jason-also a producer-as Levon, an ex military man just trying to lead a normal life, when he is forced back into his old life. Jason works at a construction company owned by his friend, Michael, who treats him like family. Noemi plays Michael's daughter and when she is kidnapped by the Russian mob-to be used in sex trafficking-Michael begs Jason to save her. Of course, what can Jason do but help out his buddy and put a big Whoop Ass on the bad guys. David plays an old war buddy of Jason's that can supply him with any hardware he might need. As far as plots go, there isn't much new here, but it's a Jason Statham action flick.It's rated R for violence, drug use and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.Although it's not as action packed as The Beekeeper was, it is still a good action movie-If you like Jason-and a good one to stream.",

        "content": "The Good: Jason Statham. Jason Flemyng. Michael Pena. David Ayer. Sylvester Stallone's retro 80's script. All on paper, at least. So, nothing, really.The Bad: Cinematography. Editing. Direction. Weak script. Atrocious dialogue. Poor characterisation. Overly convoluted and derivative plot. ADHD pacing.The Verdict: As mentioned above, the cast, crew, and plot sound awesome on paper, but everyone involved in this movie is just phoning it in. It's both frustrating and heartbreaking given it's potential. I love David Ayer's previous work in both directing (Fury, End of Watch, and even Suicide Squad) and screenwriting (Training Day, The Fast & The Furious (2001)), but fear that a certain studio's interference in one of those (no prizes for guessing which) has left him both disillusioned and broken as a filmmaker. David Ayer wants to be Tony Scott, but has somehow relegated himself to doing Michael Winner-esque revenge thrillers (see last year's The Beekeeper if you don't believe me), which hurts me more, as the late Michael Winner made some decent films in the past (The Jokers, Death Wish, The Nightcomers, Dirty Weekend (THE proto-feminist revenge thriller)). The Michael Winner comparison continues as Jason Statham (who has an awesome filmography including Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Revolver, Jet Li's The One, The Bank Job, Crank, Blitz, The Meg, and Wrath of Man (Guy Ritchie's far superior effort compared to this)) has now earned the unofficial Charles Bronson (the late actor) of today Award. The film itself is like a pastiche of Man on Fire (2004), Taken, and Road House without doing anything original or different. It's as if Sly Stallone wrote the screenplay (based on the novel Levon's Trade by Chuck Dixon) in the 1980's, sat on it for 40 years, and gave it to David Ayer to punch it up throwing in cell phones, Tinder (still a thing, really?) and Emoji references (what?!). Then there's the editing that would give Michael Bay a Grand Mal seizure, and the continuity is all over the place. Pay £15 to see this lame and tame garbage peeing on the silver screen or wait a month and have it defecate on your face in the comfort of your own home? Hollywood seriously need to look in the mirror while they cut their nose off to spite their face, as they're destroying a lot of filmmakers and theatres in the process (their bread and butter!). You've been warned... unless you're Gen-Z in which case, you might have a blast. God only knows what Snow White (2025) must be like to lose money to this crap.",

It follows the usual formula: someone harms my loved ones, so I take revenge and eliminate dozens of people.And yet, something about it still drew me in-the fight scenes, certain characters, the cinematography, and the camera work all had a gripping effect.Of course, it's hard to ignore the countless overused clichés. The Russian mafia villains, the \"if you don't have a daughter, you wouldn't understand\" sentiment, and the cheap jokes all make it understandable why many dismissed it as yet another failed attempt.But if you approach it simply as a mindless action-packed spectacle, I think there are genuinely enjoyable elements to be found in it.",

I give it a five because that's what I expected. Just a stylized action movie and cringe dialogue. The novel series by Chuck Dixon should've been made into an episodic series on HBO or Paramount.

The comedic attempts are hit or miss. I laughed at some but others fell flat. And my investment/engagement was... medium?I can't fully explain why it didn't work better. Maybe it's because none of the aspects excel. Maybe it's because the entire cast outside of the lead is weak (most of them are TV actors, not movie actors).I just didn't feel that spark. I definitely didn't mind watching it. But it's not something memorable that I see myself revisiting.Hopefully 2025 can turn itself around because this is the worst start to the year I can remember.P.

For god's sake, the movie begins with a shot of an alarm clock as the character wakes up; the ultimate go to for any student film. As the movie progresses, the tone shifts from light hearted, to haphazardly dark humored, and then to very forced attempts at being emotional. The pacing never felt like it was as frantic as it wanted to be either. Everything felt so emotionally inconsistent that it became boring. As for the graphic violence, it felt more like a cheap stunt to shock the people who were falling asleep during all the dull moments.D.",

It stars Jack Quaid and Amber Midthunder and is about a guy who can't feel physical pain/sensations who embarks on a rescue mission after the girl he likes is kidnapped during a bank robbery. There were several things to enjoy about this movie - the premise was interesting and it was comedic to see some of the situations he got himself into during his rescue mission. While I didn't hate this film, I wasn't super in love with it, which surprised me because the trailer made it look pretty fun. Part of the problem is, I think, the casting of Jack Quaid - who seems to play the same type of character in most of his roles - and the writing of the love interest could have probably been improved in ways to make her character a bit more likable. An unnecessary racially divisive line snuck in at the end was nonsensical too. But as a whole, I've seen worse movies, so I don't consider this a waste of my time.

        "title": "more FUN than I expected.",
        "content": "I expected a pretty standard crime thriller like something straightforward, maybe even predictable. But by the end, this film has more going on beneath the surface. It blends dark humor, unexpected twist, and clever action in a way that makes it stand out.The story centers on Nathan Caine, a quiet, introverted assistant bank manager living in San Diego. Nathan has a rare condition called congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), meaning he physically can't feel pain. It's an unusual trait that the movie uses to great effect. Instead of making him invincible, it shows how Nathan has to outthink his enemies and use his condition smartly when things go sideways.At first, his life seems pretty routine, awkward social interactions, a hesitant romance with a coworker, and dealing with people from his childhood. But the film doesn't stay quiet for long. A group of robbers dressed in Santa suits shows up and kicks off a series of events that turn Nathan's world upside down. What I appreciated is that the plot doesn't just unfold in a straight line. It's got some sharp turns and reveals that kept me guessing without feeling forced.One thing that surprised me was how much comedy is sprinkled throughout. Despite the dark, tense situations, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. There are moments of awkward humor, dry wit, and even a few absurd situations that had me smile. It adds some levity and keeps the pacing fresh, especially in the first half.Visually, Novocaine is solid. The cinematography has a cool, slightly moody vibe without being too over-stylized, and the sound design does a great job enhancing both the tension and the action. You really feel the weight of certain moments, whether it's a quiet stare-down or a burst of violence.That said, not everything hits perfectly. There's a chase scene that, while important to the plot, feels a little sluggish at times. Some shots lack the energy you'd expect from a high-stakes pursuit, it almost feels like it loses momentum when it should be cranking up. It doesn't ruin the movie by any means, but it stood out as one of the weaker parts.Still, where Novocaine really shines is in its characters and clever action sequences. The film doesn't rely on massive explosions. Instead, it's more about strategy, survival, and seeing how someone like Nathan, who isn't a traditional action hero, handles increasingly dangerous situations.By the end Novocaine proves itself to be more than just a simple action/thriller. It's sharp, funny, and keeps you on your toes, even if it has slower spots. If you're into thrillers that mix brains with a bit of dark comedy and unique lead characters, this one's worth a watch.",

        "title": "superhero of pain",
        "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. In decades past, we wouldn't have been surprised in the least to see a movie starring Jack Nicholson and Dennis Quaid. In fact, in 1973 Jack co-starred with Dennis' brother Randy in one of my favorite films, THE LAST DETAIL. Well, here we are more than fifty years later, and Dennis' (and Meg Ryan's) son Jack Quaid is co-starring with Jack's son Ray Nicholson in what is sure to be one of this year's most outlandish action-comedies. The screenplay is by Lars Jacobson and the film is co-directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, who also collaborated on BODY (2015).REM's \"Everybody Hurts\" plays over the opening credits and sequence which provide hints to the measures Nathan Caine (Jack Quaid, COMPANION, 2025) has taken around his house. With tennis balls shielding sharp corners and a stop to prevent scalding water in the shower, Nathan appears to be quite accident-prone. We learn he's a good-guy Assistant Manager at a local San Diego bank, and profiles as nebbish in his looks and skittish mannerisms ... especially around new bank teller Sherry (Amber Midthunder, THE ICE ROAD, 2021). Sensing his awkwardness and attraction, Sherry takes charge and asks Nathan to lunch. A bite of cherry pie leads Nathan to disclose his rare genetic disorder - he simply cannot feel pain (thus explaining the earlier tennis balls).One personal disclosure leads to another, which leads to an art gallery, which leads to romantic intimacy and what easily could spin off into a familiar quirky rom-com with these two. Instead, while Nathan is riding an emotional high, three men dressed as Santa Claus violently rob the bank on Christmas Eve and take Nathan's new squeeze Sherry as hostage. This sends our wimpy superhero Nathan (nicknamed Novocaine by junior high bullies) on a rescue mission. His previous fighting experience has been limited to online video game sessions with Roscoe (Jacob Batalon, Ned from Marvel movies), although the two have never actually met.The fight sequences are quite violent and absurdly comical in how they take advantage of Nathan's blend of physical disorder, nice guy tendencies, and commitment to rescuing his first love. Creativity is at maximum volume as Nathan takes on a red-hot frying pan and boiling oil in a restaurant kitchen skirmish, replete with bodily poundings that would leave anyone else shattered. Things really pick up in a wickedly booby-trapped house that sets up a HOME ALONE joke. Mostly, however, the body horror serves as punchline after punchline ... some surely to tweak even the most squeamish movie goers.Ray Nicholson (I LOVE YOU FOREVER, 2024) provides a jolt of adrenaline and psychotic violent behavior to ensure no one watching still believes this is a rom-com in the making. His Simon thrives not so much on the money from the robberies as the power and control he displays and the torture he doles out. The finale battles between Simon and Nathan are extreme and creatively unique. While the entertainment value is present, there are still some minor issues with the story and proceedings. The detectives on the case are played by Betty Gabriel (GET OUT, 2017) and Matt Walsh (\"Veep\"). These two talented actors are given very little to do and it's a shame their roles weren't beefed up a bit. Additionally, there is a key twist that will surprise almost no one. Is it even a twist if they tell you it's coming?The action scenes are purposefully absurd, and although some bits are over-the-top, others are pure comedy-action brilliance. Jack Quaid is fitting right in to his lead character roles, and Ray Nicholson is mastering the wild-eyed psycho dude. Amber Midthunder shows yet again how immensely talented she is, and it's likely her future roles will take advantage of what she brings on screen. My personal biggest hope is that the filmmakers avoid a sequel ... one which would likely leave us viewers disappointingly numb (had to work in one pun).Opens in theaters on March 14, 2025.",

        "content": "Nate (Jack Quaid) is a mild-mannered bank employee with a genetic disorder. He can feel no pain. It sounds like a superpower, but the problem is that he can seriously injure himself without realising the fact. As a result he leads an extremely risk-averse life. All sharp edges in his home are padded, he avoids solid food for fear of biting his tongue in half, and he sets an alarm on his watch to remind him to go to the bathroom, because his bladder might burst if he forgets.As a result, he lives a rather lonely life, playing video games with a friend he's never met face to face. That's until he falls for fellow employee Sherry (Amber Midthunder). Maybe things are looking up?Then the bank is held up by three armed raiders, who get away with a lot of money plus a hostage - Sherry. Nate gives chase - leading him into a series of perils and adventures. He's not helped by the fact that the police aren't sure which side he's on.The result is stupid (in a good way) but great fun, as Nate receives a series of increasingly-bizarre injuries without them slowing him down at all. There are enough twists to make things interesting, and enough comedy to make this film an enjoyable watch.",

Everything centres around a mild mannered introverted type of guy, Nathan Caine (Jack Quaid) that cannot feel pain - \"congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)\" - and the comical opportunities that arise from this.It sort of reminds me of Wolverine's \"Regenerative Healing Factor\" but dialed down for a more everyday guy. With the wolverine films you get to see numerous funny scenarios that exhibit his regeneration abilities. This film is a bit similar to that.Is this film especially groundbreaking? No. Does it have inconsistencies? Yes, certain painful stimuli should cause serious injury regardless of whether Novocaine feels anything or not. Is it a fun 1hr 50? Mostly, yes.

        "content": "It genuinely pains me when I have to say that a movie has absolutely nothing going for it, but, in the case of this celluloid trainwreck, I can come up with no other way to describe it. This overlong, frequently implausible, gratuitously violent, truly stupid offering from directors Dan Berk and Robert Olsen is one of the worst excuses for a film that I have ever seen, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that. The film tells the story of Nick Caine (a.k.a. \"Novocaine\") (Jack Quaid), a 30-something credit union assistant manager who suffers from a rare genetic disorder that shields him from experiencing any kind of pain or discomfort when injured, even though the physical damage to his body is real enough. He's something of a sheltered, geeky milquetoast, having lived much of his life isolated from many of its everyday experiences as a means to protect him from potential undue harm. So it's highly inconceivable that he somehow knows how to skillfully handle himself when caught up in a robbery of his workplace and his subsequent one-man amateur pursuit of the bad guys when they escape with a hostage, one of the facility's tellers (Amber Midthunder), who also happens to be his new girlfriend. However, as this scenario plays out, the narrative grows progressively more preposterous with every passing frame, much of it designed to show how many times he can be shot, beat up and brutally hacked apart without ever feeling anything and yet still be able to keep going with his mission. Because of this, the sequence of events becomes increasingly repetitive, ever-more farfetched and just plain dumb, with ridiculous, over-the-top plot developments that fail to engage and frequently feature incongruous and unoriginal dialogue. But, to add real insult to injury, this release bills itself as a comedy but is virtually devoid of humor except a smattering of one-liners that mostly fall flat. This offering is so ineptly executed that it makes productions like \"Joker 2\" and the \"John Wick\" movies look like masterpieces by comparison. Indeed, if you've watched the trailer for this one, you've seen all you really need to see. \"Novocaine\" is a sorry excuse for contemporary filmmaking and a prime example of everything that's wrong with the domestic motion picture industry these days, a cinematic cautionary tale for film school students on how not to make a movie. By all means, skip this one, even when it becomes available for streaming.",

        "content": "If Novocaine wasn't so extremely violent and incredibly bloody, I would call it 'lighthearted': it's frivolous, humorous, a touch romantic and often ridiculous. And it's also quite a lot of fun.Jack Quaid stars as assistant bank manager Nathan 'Novocaine' Caine, who, thanks to a rare genetic disorder, is unable to feel physical pain. When armed criminals rob the bank, taking Nate's new girlfriend Sherry (Amber Midthunder) hostage, he attempts to track down the gang and rescue the girl.The film's gimmick - that mild-mannered Nathan can be shot, burnt, beaten and broken and not feel the effect - makes for a very entertaining action film, even if, truth be told, the humour doesn't always land. One might expect the novelty to quickly wear off, but writer Lars Jacobson manages to keep it from becoming stale, finding plenty of new and creative ways to inflict damage on his central character.If you've caught the trailer, which revealed far too much, the impact of certain scenes will probably be diminished, but there is at least one major twist, which they thankfully didn't give away in the previews, that adds an extra level of interest to the story.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for opening with Everybody Hurts by R. E. M. (although Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb would have worked as well).",

        "title": "Jack Takes the Lead!",
        "content": "The premise and trailer propelled this action-comedy to being my sixth most anticipated film of the year. As for whether it lived up to my high expectations having seen it, it did, although one issue is somewhat painful to overlook. That was an intentional pun, but it's not as dramatic as that pun would have you believe.Let's start with Jack Quaid's exceptional performance. He makes Nathan Caine an investing and often funny protagonist as he risks his life to save his dream girl - also, he can't feel pain. That's important, too. Refreshingly, Caine doesn't have a past like a John Wick, a Hutch Mansell, or a Bryan Mills. He's legitimately an ordinary guy who unlocks beast mode like he had previous experience. The rest of the cast did solid work, although Jacob Batalon and Amber Midthunder - despite one decision - were the other standouts alongside Quaid.Lars Jacobson's screenplay increases the fun on display and contains an unexpected amount of heart. \"Novocaine\" isn't a straightforward action-comedy as it doubles as a romantic comedy, which I wasn't expecting. First, \"Companion,\" then \"Heart Eyes,\" and now this film provides the perfect case of 2025 bringing back the romantic comedy, albeit while being another genre first. Furthermore, Jacobson's work makes Caine incredibly relatable, and his simple backstory helps him be that.Dan Berk and Robert Olsen's direction was flashy and fun. Many moments showed creativity in camerawork and editing - added credit goes to cinematographer Jacques Jouffett and editor Christian Wagner - while Berk and Olsen's work enhanced the narrative and script.The action was an action fan's delight. While not as focused as expected, the film creatively utilizes Caine's incapacity to sense pain to the action's advantage.Finally, the 1 hour and 50 minute runtime was rarely wasteful, with two exceptions. I felt the movie perfectly balances comedy, action, drama, and romance to create an experience that always engages.Now, let's get into my mixed feelings on some aspects. I won't spoil anything because I still feel it's worth seeing. Nonetheless, I'm all about being honest in my reviews.First, there are two to three cop scenes that threaten the film's momentum, but thankfully, they're not as long as I thought they'd be once they began. Using \"The Beekeeper\" and \"Knox Goes Away\" as comparisons, the scenes that focused on the people investigating Adam Clay and John Knox dragged on. They don't as much in here.Now, I'll get into the real thing that bothered me while being vague at the same time. While I enjoyed Midthunder's Sherry, a reveal about forty minutes in bothered me. It made sense in the end, but until then, I was baffled that they decided to do that. I expected a direct approach to her character, but it wasn't, yet they somehow made it work. Making another comparison, but one that makes less sense, \"Blink Twice\" was a film that started confusingly. I didn't know how to feel about Frida and Jess, and the film wasn't entirely compelling when it began. As the movie continues, especially with that final revelation, it all comes together and makes up for its issues. That was the sensation I got with Sherry, although it wasn't as much of a payoff as \"Blink Twice.\" It was more or less a \"Thank God!\" moment that the movie's primary issue fixed itself in the end rather than, \"Oh, that's what the movie was leading to.\"Overall, \"Novocaine\" might have fallen a wee bit short of expectations, but it was damn fun regardless! Jack Quaid proves he's a leading man, and the entire film proves that you don't need to be part of a franchise to make an entertaining action-comedy.Technically, screenplay issues aside, the acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and editing make for a 9/10 technical score.For the enjoyment score, I loved many things about \"Novocaine,\" although that reveal dared to weigh down the experience. Otherwise, it's not a stretch to say we need more movies like this from major studios. It doesn't have to be all about IP, and it's films like this that are why. Although the enjoyment score should realistically be a 9, the movie knows what it is and runs with it - and Jack Quaid is so fantastic that I forgive the flaw. Therefore, the enjoyment score is a 10/10. It's not the best movie of the year thus far, as \"Companion\" remains my favorite, but it's a thrilling time!It's the end of the review, but I want to focus on \"Companion.\" Coincidentally, Quaid's other vehicle from January was my eighth most anticipated film of the year. I'm shocked that I can't call \"Mickey 17\" better than that. I can't stress enough how incredible that film was. It's a thriller that quadruples as a horror, a dark comedy, and, as I mentioned earlier, a romcom. Quaid was better here in \"Novocaine,\" but he was excellent as Josh, and Sophie Thatcher gave an astounding performance as Iris. I'd recommend seeing both \"Companion\" and \"Novocaine.\" People like me who aren't Jack Quaid fans are realizing that this man's a star on the rise that's worth paying attention to. I'm interested and even excited to see what he does next if Josh and Nathan Caine are any indications of his undeniable talents.",

It's a fast ride into this odd rescue operation that has a quick intro to set things up before diving into the big event. From there, the movie is like a video game where stages are intense bouts of comedic brawling that have just a few interludes to reset and progress the story. It's got enough logic to make all the theatrics work and the ridiculous idea plausible in this world of extravagant heroism. The fights are creative, a blend of comedy and craziness that works well to keep the audience laughing and promising some of the action alongside it. It's bloody, raw, and vicious, but it's wonderful on so many levels in how diverse they kept things in these fights. A wild collection of sound editing and a fantastic soundtrack accompany the movie and give it that flair that rolls with the craziness. The movie manages to incorporate a lot of references into the movie in the form of props, callouts, quotes, and mimicry that were very welcome, utilized to a grand extent to keep the entertainment coming. Many of these lines were so well-timed that I burst out laughing from how amazing the jab was. The acting helps to bring all of this to life, with Quaid continuing to take his awkward style and twist it comedically in different ways. A stark contrast to his Companions character, I loved the character he got to make and how well he unleashed that quirkiness. Wrap it all up with great camera work to keep the action in the scene, but also find unique angles to get the moment in.DISLIKES:\nToo Stupid At Times\nSuspense of Disbelief Is Sometimes A Bit Much\nMore Character Balance\nAction Is Reasonable But Bland\nIt Could Have Been A Bit Deeper/Twist Executed Later\nWatch the Language\nHard-to-Watch Scenes\nSummary:\nThe movie is very stupid, an aggressive twitch that will not be for everyone and may not be noted in the trailers. For one thing, the movie requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. The condition may be plausible, but the degree of injuries he faces approach, if not surpass, John Wick levels of pain. To then have the logic deficit and timing inconsistencies adds the cherries on top to this silliness sundae, which those who must have believability need to avoid. Past that, the movie still needs a bit more balance in some of the characters, a bit more balance for the three groups to help flesh out a little more story, a bit more depth in the mystery, a bit more suspense, and a bit later implementation of the twist to bring that knockout punch. The action is reasonable in this film for the comedic component, a realistic execution of this situation, but one that needed a tad more action to give you the excitement the trailers promised. Fortunately, the movie accomplishes the entertainment value enough to offset this and is more than enough to have you laughing. As for the other limitations, the language is a bit harsh and lazy in execution to the point that it gets annoying and will irritate those with low sensitivity to cursing language. In addition, my friends who struggle to watch bouts of torture, suffering, and extreme cruelty to the human body are going to need to divert from this film as well. The blood alone could be sickening, but the movie only gets worse in terms of suffering and gore as it continues, and the camera captures every ounce of detail in big-screen glory. Please make sure to exercise caution.The VERDICT:\nNovocaine is nuts, fun, and just plain popcorn-munching flick that I've needed for a while. It's a ludicrous concept that requires great blindness to reality, yet it keeps itself grounded to not get too out there to be obnoxious. A well-cast crew helps bring the comedy and characters to life, nailing the dialog with exceptional finesse, awesome inflections, and the right amount of emotion for every moment. The action is not as composed as John Wick, but for the story and comedy, it works to be entertaining and keep the mood elevated and supportive of the fast pace. Yet, the movie is very hard to watch for sensitive viewers, earning its R rating with pride at the violence it brings to the screen. Novocaine is a blood sport that tries to tone it down with silliness but still has plenty of skin-crawling moments when the torture is applied or a particular blow is illustrated so graphically. Throw in that the logic of the movie is going to be less appeasable to those with a sensitivity to such a plot. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Yeah, for all the visual effects and fun, it works for most people just looking for a good time, while others can choose to hold out for the theater if you are looking for something with more layers and suspense.My scores are:\nAction/Comedy/Thriller: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",

When the President is found murdered in his residence, his Secret Service detail gets right on it, and one of his top agents quickly becomes Suspect Number One. A show like this is only as good as its premise, and the premise here is terrific; and it can only maintain suspense as long as the Big Questions go unanswered, and right from the start the head-scratchers \"Paradise\" asks are\nendlessly intriguing. Who DID kill the President? WAS it the agent? What did the agent have against the President? Exactly what happened to the agent's wife? What about the \"extinction level event\" that's mentioned? And is the town they're all living in real, or is it the \"Truman Show\"-type safe haven it appears to be? Some questions are answered immediately and others aren't, but that's the show's strength; layers are peeled away, little by little, until all the various truths have slowly been revealed and we know as much as the characters do. Low-key and leisurely paced (but never dull)--with a complex plot that will leave you wondering, \"Where is all this going?\"--\"Paradise\" is a show that not only demands to be watched, but watched attentively. (Losing a plot thread here and there would be disastrous.) Shifting in time from the present to the past and back again--there's a lot of that--it's one giant jigsaw puzzle, and it's up to us to piece it together even as the characters attempt to do the same. Exactly how will it look when it's finally finished? Can't wait to find out.",

The setup of his character was almost dismissing him as an a-hole. However, the way his character is spun towards a likeable guy within a few scenes really felt quite fresh and interesting. While nothing to write home about, the dialogues are gritty, sometimes actually funny and along with enjoyable acting, glue the characters together in a fitting way.The promise the show made with how it seems to handle characters really makes you want to stay with it to see more. Having said that, I don't feel too intrigued by the immediate whodunnit mystery of the show, but I do stay open to be more invested in it as more is revealed. What I'm worried about is the world presented in the show. It's beyond ambitious to present what they need to present, and to keep it believable, with as little \"how silly is that\" moments as possible.

It teased a sci-fi direction at the end making it interesting.....Episode 2 is DREADFULLY slow and FAR less interesting... So much time spent on characters in a \"soap-opera like\" drama... occasionally teasing the sci-fi aspect. It was ENTIRELY soap opera with only one or two 20 second dialog phrases and scenes related to any sci-fi.Episode 3 is just as bad, if not worse, than episode 2.. all soap opera drama and only occasionally teasing any sci-fi via a sentence or two of dialog. There's no story about the sci-fi.. it's all about the President and drama about the people around that storyline ---- then deluges into character drama for unnecessary backstory.. family history.....It's NOT interesting. It's boring and repetitive. There's absolutely NO forward momentum regarding being \"Under the Dome 2.0\".To be frank.. I really could not care less about all the character drama... don't care about the President or anything related to him. They did a HORRIBLE job at creating any intrigue. There's practically NONE. One kind of has to allude to some motive for there to be intrigue. I certainly don't care about how the main character's familial relationships were. How the main character got along with is father seems ENTIRELY IRRELEVANT. Yet they wasted considerable screen time on that aspect. What's next? How he fondly remembers his third grade teacher???I COULD be interested in the sci-fi aspect, but if there's no story there, then there's no story. I certainly am not going to sit through 6-7 episodes of boring character-centric drama and backstories to get the answers to the sci-fi aspects they are just repetitively teasing in dialog 20 seconds at a time.This.. this is a series SCREAMING for the Fast Forward button.... in order to find the actual interesting part.I would just ask viewers... are you watching because you actually care about the agent? Or the President? Or, are you watching because you want to know why they are \"Under the Dome\"? I think, they have mistakenly written/filmed episodes regarding the story aspects which are FAR less interesting.--------------- PASS --------------I let the episodes run for a while then caught up (so I could fast forward). It is not until EPISODE 7 THE DAY where the audience learns *why* they are \"Under the Dome\".Overall, the episodes are REALLY lacking any sense of basic logic, disclosure, and direction. There's no rhyme or reason to the \"SInatra\" storyline. One has to gather clues dispersed considerably throughout the 8 episodes, then assume a plot based on the pieces - but the plot is NEVER really disclosed. To me it comes across as just trying desperately to FORCE political intrigue, but the writing \"teases\" things which appear to possibly be more interesting..... but are they? Will it take many episodes, or another full season, to get any answers to the \"teasers\" - they same way it took 7 episodes before learning WHY they are \"Under the Dome\"? This series is all stick, no carrot.Dropped my rating. It's just a well-acted, \"slick\" production of VERY mediocre and convoluted writing.",

In the book, there are corpses rotting away; due to their addiction to neurocasters, they've not fed themselves and have either died or become wasted away (the main character's foster mother has accidentally drowned in a pool whilst neurocasting). There are serious scenes of the ruins of the machines of war. There's a disturbing scene in which a robot brings a woman to orgasm. There are some quite horrific images of tangled messes of wires and metal stalking through the night, the abominations at Cape Victory, for example. My point is, the source material is written for adults...This is a kids movie. It has all of the out-of-place humour we expect in modern cinema. It has all of the over the top action we expect in modern cinema. It has the generic actors we expect in modern cinema. It has countless grand gestures, followed by a pause in which nothing happens, making every character appear ridiculous. It's either trying to be a not-particularly funny comedy or a not-particularly serious sci-fi.It's such a shame, because... imagine how this could have been. If this had have followed the plot of the book, been a dark and reflective film, with far fewer characters (even just the girl looking for her brother and the robot, perhaps with flashbacks to the foster parents), this could have been so good on screen. Unfortunately, it is so, so much less than the source material, and does the author a serious disservice.",

Yet, despite these advantages, the film falls flat, failing to deliver anything beyond its initial setup.The movie starts strong, presenting a mysterious and engaging world that grabs attention. However, as the plot unfolds, it becomes increasingly childish and loses its depth, turning what could have been a thought-provoking sci-fi journey into something simplistic and uninspired. The film seems unsure of its target audience, oscillating between serious themes and a tone that feels more suited for a younger crowd.With a cast of this caliber, the performances should have been a highlight, but instead, they feel wasted on a script that doesn't give them much to work with.Especially Millie Bobby Brown feels underwhelming. Her acting lacks the emotional weight needed to carry the story, making it difficult to connect with her character.Visually, The Electric State is impressive, as expected from a film with such a massive budget. The CGI and world-building are well-crafted, but stunning visuals alone can't compensate for a lackluster narrative. Given the talent and resources behind the project, the final result is frustratingly mediocre.Ultimately, The Electric State is a missed opportunity. It starts with promise but quickly loses its way, relying on spectacle rather than substance. For a film of this scale, it should have offered much more than a pretty but hollow experience.",

I have not read the book so cannot speak to it's faithfulness to the original story but the dialogue is funny at times. I actually find chris pratts performance better than in most movies. More self deprecating and with nuanced quirkiness. Its an action/adventure movie so i never really understand why critics hold these romps to the standard of cinema. This is not cinema, this is simply a good action/adventure flick with some funny bits. Its not a dark movie but not overly campy either. You can absolutely see where the budget went.

A perfect example of what they could have done is Sweettooth, another very unique Netflix property that has much higher ratings.",

        "content": "If viewers are looking for the haunting, dystopian vistas and devastating landscapes from Stalenhag's book, they'll be disappointed. But there are amazing and captivating effects, practical and digital, that build a unique world vision.What this film has going for it is Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown (more on them later), combining with a talented group of voice actors. Tucci is as good as ever but his part is thinly developed. Giancarlo Esposito brings his trademark gravitas and emotional weight to the story as well, in a role that, while not perfectly written, provides a surprising part of the movie's center.The Mr Peanut (Woody Harrelson) role, for me, didn't quite work. The \"bots\" I enjoyed were Herm ( unrecognizably voiced by Anthony Mackie) and the postal bot Penny Pal (Jenny Slate).There are definite plot holes, but considering the at times preposterous world we're in, is it worth complaining about story gaps? The robot cavalry makes a long sojourn to their final battlefield in a long caravan that doesn't get attacked, and improbably makes crazy good time doing it. And there's the disposal of a very central bot in a very uncaring way that wouldn't happen, but provides a sentimental wink at the viewer.Humorous, with lots of crash bang and very cool looking shots, especially with the giant sized robots, it's just fun enough, and interesting enough to watch all the way through. Pratt and Brown are fun-ish together, and bring their acting talents to a movie from a genre they are both very familiar with, so I do recommend it.But Brown feels wrong in this: her appearance as a bounced around foster child feels too \"glam\" at times, because she isn't grubby enough. Her acting also feels very much as though she's going through the paces, almost too self aware. Her fluffed up lip's lipstick and gloss doesn't fit with Keats' (Pratt) grimy, disheveled bootlegger.While Brown is given too many \"noble\" lines to deliver without coming off as sanctimonious, and Pratt is a little too much like Starlord at his most shrill and irritating; you can mostly forgive them because of their innate charm.The Russo brothers are definitely talented, so there is a high bar set before you watch the first scene.But they made a choice, the scary barren world that the book painted beautifully, is not the direction they picked. Instead they leaned into a little Spielberg, a little Lucas and some James Gunn. It doesn't make for a perfect movie, but hey, I watched the whole thing and wasn't mad that I watched it.There's a lot of kvetching about the big budget and where did it all go. I have two thoughts on that: one, those cool shots of the giant bots, and the very good animatronic facial expressions weren't cheap. Second, the movie definitely feels like there were a number of scenes that were cut. Quite a few actually. I'd definitely watch the full cut, if there is such a thing. There are many telling points, story jumps being one, but Holly Hunter is too much of an accomplished actress to appear in one scene, and a voiceover.So, give it a watch, you won't be mad that you did, and if you are, well, there's worse things to be mad at.Just don't expect to be blown away, and hoping for a new franchise.",

What annoyed me at first was the robot named Cosmo that has the same concept as Bumblebee where its voice is kinda broken and has to use records from TV show. Like why they use the same exact concept, I guess that big budget didn't go to the writing department. We only got introduced to the main characters like 3 minutes and then the siblings got into an accident OFFSCREEN leaving me puzzled and confused. What worse is the movie depends heavily to Millie Bobby Brown emotions and Netflix never learns that she has no range of it at all. She attempts to do it several times and failed miserably everytime. She really needs to watch other movies and learns how to potray emotions because I'm sure she'll get another role from Netflix.

        "title": "The Electric State - There's style, but what about substance?",
        "content": "Marketed as the most expensive film in history, The Electric State carried an enormous weight of expectations. Did this grand-scale promotion work in its favor? Perhaps. After all, if you factor in marketing expenses, the budget would be astronomical. So, what kind of movie did the Russo brothers create with their $320 million budget? Let's break it down.Set in 1997, after a devastating war between humans and machines, the film is packed with nostalgic elements-from the soundtrack to countless pop culture references of the era. The world-building is impressive, with a great variety of robotic designs that feel both inventive and visually distinct. The CGI, surprisingly, blends in seamlessly. Compared to a recent film like The Creator, the VFX here are just as good-if not better in certain moments.The story itself is fairly straightforward: a seemingly ordinary girl (Millie Bobby Brown) unknowingly holds the key to saving the world. Along the way, she finds allies in a rogue drifter (Chris Pratt) and his robot companion (Anthony Mackie). This unlikely duo makes for a fun buddy-movie dynamic, mixing the energy of a high schooler with the cynicism of a social outcast.Structurally, The Electric State feels like two different films. The first half leans heavily into childlike simplicity-almost to the point of being off-putting. However, once the second half kicks in, the pacing picks up, and the character dynamics become genuinely engaging.The film's strongest aspects? Without a doubt, its visuals and characters. Each character has a distinct presence, and the mix of humor, especially from the robots and Chris Pratt, works well. Pratt essentially plays a version of his Marvel character, which, honestly, suits him perfectly.Where does the film fall short? Ironically, in the very world it creates. The first 10 minutes set up a fascinating backstory-one that could have been the foundation for a much more compelling narrative. Instead, the film quickly moves past this, leaving us with a far less intriguing plot.Final Verdict:\nThe Electric State is exactly the kind of film that belongs on Netflix. It doesn't try to be something it's not; it's designed purely for entertainment. A solid choice for a casual movie night-fun, visually impressive, but ultimately forgettable.",

        "title": "Disappointed",
        "content": "A couple of years ago, Tales from the Loop hooked me with its quiet, haunting brilliance-Simon Stålenhag's retro-futurist world brought to life with eerie depth. So when The Electric State, another Stålenhag adaptation, hit Netflix today, March 14, 2025, I was primed for something special. Instead, I got a hollow shell of what could've been. Directed by the Russo brothers and backed by a $320 million budget, this film takes a stunning premise-rebellious robots in an alt-1990s America-and flattens it into a formulaic, cliché-riddled slog. It's not just a step down from Loop; it's a stumble into Saturday morning cartoon territory.The setup sounds promising: Millie Bobby Brown plays Michelle, a loner chasing her brother Christopher, presumed dead but possibly reborn as a robot. Chris Pratt tags along as Keats, a smuggler with a quippy bot sidekick, Herman (Anthony Mackie). The visuals dazzle-hulking CGI robots roam desert wastelands, and the production design pops with quirky touches like Woody Harrelson's Mr. Peanut, a peanut-shaped bot with a top hat. There's a flicker of Stålenhag's eerie aesthetic in the margins: abandoned diners, flickering neurocaster ads, a sense of a world gone wrong. But that's where the magic ends.The writing is the first offender-trite, predictable, and painfully safe. The book's slow-burn road trip, drenched in melancholy and existential dread, gets swapped for a Marvel-ized action-comedy romp. Gone is the neurocaster addiction plaguing society; instead, we get a watered-down \"tech bad, family good\" moral tacked onto a third act that feels focus-grouped to death. The Hive Mind, a chilling force in the novel, barely registers here-just a vague plot device to justify robot fights. It's as if the Russo brothers, fresh off Avengers blockbusters, couldn't resist sanding down every sharp edge for mass appeal.Then there's Chris Pratt. Once again, he's Star-Lord 2.0-cocky, charming, and utterly tiresome after so many outings. His Keats struts through the film cracking one-liners, but there's no depth, no arc, just a recycled persona coasting on charisma. Millie Bobby Brown fares better, bringing a flicker of grit to Michelle, but she's saddled with a script that doesn't know what to do with her. Anthony Mackie's Herman injects some fun-his bickering with Keats lands a few laughs-but it's not enough to salvage the mess. Even the supporting cast (Stanley Tucci, Giancarlo Esposito) feels wasted, popping in for cameos that add little.The Russo brothers' polish is undeniable-$320 million buys you slick robot battles and a glossy sheen. But it's all surface. The film mails it in, turning Stålenhag's haunting vision into a generic sci-fi flick that could've been churned out by an algorithm. Critics agree: a 19% on Rotten Tomatoes and 31 on Metacritic reflect the consensus that this is a swing and a miss. For fans of the book, it's a betrayal; for newcomers, it's forgettable noise.Could it have been more? Absolutely. Tales from the Loop proved Stålenhag's worlds can resonate on screen with patience and soul. The Electric State opts for noise over nuance, flash over feeling. It's not unwatchable-turn off your brain, and the visuals might carry you through a lazy Saturday night. But if you're expecting the weight of Loop or the book's quiet power, you'll leave disappointed. This isn't an adaptation; it's a cartoonish cash-in.",

        "content": "In the Lost Lands may superficially resemble a Resident Evil film, but it's nothing like Resident Evil. It's a dark, brooding, gothic western/dark fantasy film. Courtesy of returning editor Niven Howie (no more Doobie White) the pacing is both very brisk yet every scene feels like it has enough room to breathe, room to brood. The atmosphere is immaculate. The film's violence, when it erupts, is incredibly brutal.As an adaptation, I feel the marketing did a huge disservice because practically everything important from George R. R. Martin's short story is present, just fleshed out and placed into a framework where the film tries to make the central premise plausible. It's no wonder George liked the movie.The film's supporting cast feel a lot more fleshed out than many PWSA films despite the lean 101 minute runtime. Supporting characters feeling undercooked has always been a problem for him, and here it feels like he avoids that issue. Dave and Milla both give excellent performances, Arly Jover is magnetically hateable as the film-original antagonist Ash, and the rest of the cast put in strong, memorable performances.The visual design isn't really going for naturalism. I can see it being controversial, but I think the film absolutely achieves what it set out to do. A combination of incredibly well designed practical sets and bleak digital environments combine to produce extremely striking imagery. It's easily the most striking images of any PWSA film since Event Horizon. The word \"heavy metal\" gets thrown around a lot, but that describes this film.The film's primary weakness is the execution of the ending, particularly the last few section. It tries to have its cake and eat it, too regarding the source material, and it gives off the impression of a film that had its ending reshot or otherwise adjusted in response to test screenings. However, the rest of the film is so strong that the slightly wobbly ending isn't enough to derail it.In a lot of ways, the film reminds me of The Keep, a film PWSA is quite obviously fixated on. Incredibly bold imagery, a compelling electronic score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger, and a weirdly abrupt and jarring ending.I don't know how the wider audience is going to view this film, but I really liked it, and I think it will become a cult classic. There's nothing else like it. Some will compare it to Resident Evil, or Mad Max, but it's not really like either of them in its actual execution and tone.",

Anderson, the king of soulless adaptations, once again proves that he can turn even rich source material into a dull, lifeless, CGI-infested wasteland. This so-called \"dark fantasy epic\" feels more like a two-hour endurance test, complete with cringe-worthy dialogue, terrible pacing, and a story that stumbles over itself before falling flat on its face.Milla Jovovich, ever loyal to her director husband, sleepwalks through the role of Gray Alys, a \"powerful\" witch who does absolutely nothing of consequence. Dave Bautista's Boyce is reduced to a grunting sidekick whose only personality trait is looking annoyed. Arly Jover's villain, Ash, is as generic as they come-another discount \"mysterious antagonist\" who seems to exist solely because the film needs a bad guy.Visually, it's an absolute mess. The CGI looks cheap, the sets are empty and lifeless, and the action sequences-supposedly a highlight-are choppy, weightless, and completely devoid of impact. The editing is so erratic that it feels like the movie was pieced together by someone who had never seen a film before. The color grading makes everything look like it was shot through a dirty fish tank, and the soundtrack is as forgettable as the script itself.The biggest crime of In the Lost Lands is that it's boring. There's no tension, no stakes, and no reason to care. It pretends to have deep lore but refuses to develop it, instead throwing vague fantasy jargon at the audience and hoping it sticks. Even George R. R. Martin's weak endorsement-saying it \"captured his voice better than other adaptations\"-feels more like a desperate attempt to salvage its reputation than genuine praise.By the time the credits roll, the only real mystery is how this ever got made. A movie with this much potential should not be this awful. In the Lost Lands is a soulless, plodding, incoherent disaster that even the most forgiving fantasy fans should avoid at all costs. If you're looking for a dark fantasy adventure, watch literally anything else.\"",

The dialogue feels artificial-almost as if it were generated by AI-devoid of any real emotion or depth.Milla Jovovich and Dave Bautista are talented actors, and their performances were solid, but even great acting can't save a movie with a weak script. A compelling story is the backbone of any good film, and this one simply didn't have it.I can't help but wonder: Did anyone actually read the script before agreeing to this project? With such a high-budget production, featuring top-tier actors and elaborate CGI, it's baffling that the storytelling was so poor.I'm giving In the Lost Lands a 5/10, solely because of the acting and visual effects. Sadly, without a strong narrative, it all feels like an empty spectacle.",

Unfortunately, despite its promising premise, the film ends up being a muddled mix of contrasting elements that fail to deliver on its potential.The movie attempts to blend light-hearted banter with fast-paced action scenes, but rather than complementing each other, these two elements feel disjointed. The interactions between Bautista and Jovovich are meant to bring an engaging dynamic to the screen, yet their relationship comes across as confusing and inconsistent. It's as if the film can't quite decide if it wants to be a buddy action flick or a more serious, high-stakes adventure. The result? A love-hate chemistry that never quite resonates.The monsters featured in the film are a notable aspect, with two very distinct types making an appearance. However, while they could have added an exciting layer to the narrative, their presence doesn't feel fully explored or impactful. The action sequences, though fast-paced, seem to lack any real depth or excitement, leaving the audience somewhat detached.The pacing of the movie is another point of frustration. For all the action and monster encounters, the film still manages to drag in places. Despite the thrilling backdrop, I found myself zoning out at times, wondering why the story failed to maintain my attention. The blend of humor, action, and monstrous threats should have kept things lively, but instead, it felt like a series of missed opportunities.In conclusion, \"In The Lost Lands\" is a film that doesn't quite know what it wants to be. The relationship between Bautista and Jovovich offers a flicker of potential, but the inconsistent tone, lackluster action, and overall pacing make it a difficult movie to invest in. While it may appeal to those who enjoy lighter, more chaotic fantasy films, I found it hard to stay engaged.",

The queen of this city approaches the cursed witch Gray Alys (Milla Jovovich) with a request - grant her the power of the werewolf. Because Gray Alys is unable to turn down any requests, she agrees and hires hunter Boyce (Dave Bautista) to take her into the titular Lost Lands to seek out the last remaining werewolf.Complicating this quest is the fact that the Church which shares power in the city is determined to hang Gray Alys as a heretic, and the Patriarch of the Church sees an opportunity to take down the queen and sieze absolute power himself.Needless to say, the church pursuit provides plenty of opportunity for Gray Alys and Boyce to blow away, gun down, and neck-snap an unfeasible amount of bad guys along the way.It's a stunning film in parts, with a decent twist at the end. But the villains (especially the Church baddies) are so one-note and inept that I was genuinely surprised to find out that this is based on a George RR Martin story.Still, all in all it's a fun ride for 100 minutes and it looks great on the big screen.",

        "content": "2 out of 5 stars.In the Lost Lands is a bad fantasy epic film that is based on a story from George Martin. Which the story is brief and lacking substance.Pros:The film is very fast moving. It's a Paul W. S. Anderson film which means it's going to be quickly paced. Plenty of action. And mindless entertainment. Well it is fast paced but it lacks every thing else in the film.Cons:It is one of Paul W. S. Anderson worst films in his history. The Three Musketeers had a somewhat decent entertainment value. I loved the Resident Evil films for what it was. And it was not much. It was plenty of entertainment. Even his Monster Hunter. In the Lost Lands is a film that is a combo of genres of gunslingers, westerns. And post apocalyptic. Mad Max with a bit of werewolves, witches and monsters. And a cult of church fanatics that went insane. Film was all over the place. It was just boring.The visual effect were throughout the movie from sets and back drop. Creating the hazy, brooding atmosphere, and dark lighting. Film just felt like one big hazy dream. Lots of camera lens flares that was used for the tone of the film just felt like a cheap production.The plot was fast and lacking development with the story. It was difficult to care for any characters.The action sequences were disappointing. Paul Andersons worst films on handling the action. It was brief in most scenes. And lacking the entertainment value. The climatic fight with Werewolf and Witch was short and quick. It was hard to care for it.Milla Jovovich and Dave Bautista were okay with there roles. The script had cheesy dialogue filled for there characters and lacking any depth for them. The villain was very forgettable and was just there to be the person chasing the characters throughout the film.Overall, it was one bad film that action was boring, even the story and direction. It was shocking to see Paul Anderson slipping as a filmmaker. Which he does a great job in creating blockbuster entertainment. This fantasy film is not one of them.",

        "content": "4/10 STARS - In the Lost Lands is based on a George R R Martin short story of the same name from 1982. Milla Jovovich stars as Gray Alys, a witch who has to grant the wish of everyone who comes to her, even though granting those wishes has unintended consequences for those who ask. She is sent by the queen to the Lost Lands to obtain the power of turning into a werewolf. Before embarking on her journey, Alys enlists the aid of a mysterious hunter named Boyce, played by Dave Bautista. Unfortunately, Milla Jovovich doesn't have the best track record for starring in quality films and In the Lost Lands is no exception. There were some things I did like about this movie: the cinematography felt like something that came from the pages of a graphic novel, similar in some ways to a film like Sin City. And the framework of the story itself is actually pretty solid. The issues are largely in the execution of the story, which probably would have been much better served as a limited series type of production for a streaming platform. Given the vastness of the world, the various characters involved, as well as the political and religious issues at play in the background, a film of an hour and 41 minutes doesn't give it enough space to make it feel fully fleshed out and satisfying, reducing most of the characters to almost clownish figures -- hollow shells of what could have been more interesting depictions. And with a rather hefty budget of more than 55 million, this film will have an uphill battle just to break even.",

The story feels like a series of events that happening for the sole purpose of getting to horrible action sequences. Aside from Dave Bautista, I didn't care about any of the characters.

        "content": "It's not every day that you stumble upon a movie that feels like it was penned by George R. R. Martin after one too many glasses of Dornish red-and then handed over to a director who said, \"Let's make it weirder.\" Yet here we are, in the sprawling, brutal, and utterly bonkers adaptation of In the Lost Lands, where dragons and political intrigue are replaced by Milla Jovovich's dagger-sharp stares and Dave Bautista's colossal biceps.Jovovich stars as Gray Alys, a sorceress-for-hire who's as morally ambiguous as a Westerosi noble at a wedding. Alys is tasked with venturing into the titular Lost Lands to retrieve a mystical wish-because, of course, that never goes wrong. Jovovich brings her usual blend of icy badassery and haunting melancholy, channeling the energy of someone who's been through way too much but still gets up every morning to conquer magical wastelands.Then there's Bautista as Boyce, her brooding, muscle-bound companion. Think of him as the Hound, but with a softer side buried beneath layers of scar tissue and cryptic one-liners. Bautista's performance is equal parts charm and gruff intensity, and his chemistry with Jovovich is the beating heart of this film. Together, they're like an apocalyptic buddy comedy team who could take down armies-and argue over the best way to do it.Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes, assuming your idea of a feast includes dystopian landscapes, twisted creatures, and more ominous lighting than a goth-themed nightclub. The special effects are impressive, but the real magic lies in the intricate costume design and world-building, which feel ripped straight from Martin's fever dreams.The plot, however, is a different beast altogether. It's not so much a cohesive narrative as it is a series of beautifully chaotic vignettes. The story leaps from betrayal to battle to existential musings on the cost of power with the grace of a drunken dragon. It's ambitious, sure, but at times it feels like the filmmakers tried to cram an entire A Song of Ice and Fire novel into two hours.Still, for all its narrative quirks, In the Lost Lands is undeniably entertaining. It's the kind of movie that doesn't apologize for being over-the-top because it knows that's exactly what you came for. And let's be honest: who wouldn't want to see Milla Jovovich and Dave Bautista fighting monsters and each other while pondering the nature of wishes?And let's not mince words: In the Lost Lands is, hands down, the best movie with a queen in it right now. Unlike certain recent releases that reduced their royal heroines to preachy monologues and questionable creative choices (looking at you, Snow White), Gray Alys rules her scenes with commanding grace and unapologetic ruthlessness. Forget woodland critters and apple symbolism-this is a queen who'd hex you for asking too many questions and still look fabulous doing it.In the end, In the Lost Lands isn't perfect, but it's a wild, weird, and wonderfully dark ride. It's like a George R. R. Martin story brought to life by someone who decided to dial the chaos up to eleven-and we wouldn't have it any other way.",

        "content": "Just watched In the Lost Lands and I'm honestly speechless (in the best way possible).I don't usually write movie reviews, but this one deserves a little love. I went into it expecting a dark fantasy adventure, but wow - it completely pulled me into another world. You know when a film just feels different from the first scene? That's this one. And the person behind all that magic? Paul W. S. Anderson. I have to give him serious credit - he directed the hell out of this movie.From the very beginning, it's clear this isn't some cookie-cutter fantasy. The tone is dark, moody, almost poetic. The world-building is wildly original - eerie landscapes, strange creatures, a vibe that's both ancient and futuristic all at once. It's not flashy for the sake of being flashy - everything feels so intentional. The way Anderson builds the atmosphere is honestly hypnotic.One thing I absolutely loved: he doesn't rush anything. He lets the story breathe. There are moments of total silence where all you hear is the wind or footsteps in the snow - and somehow that says more than any line of dialogue could. He really trusts the audience to sit with the emotion, the tension, the stillness. That kind of confidence is rare and refreshing.Milla Jovovich is a force in this. Her character, Gray Alys, is mysterious, powerful, and so beautifully layered. You're never quite sure what to make of her - which is exactly the point. She's not a typical hero or villain, and Milla plays that ambiguity perfectly. And Dave Bautista... wow. He's got this quiet strength that just pulls you in. His scenes are heavy, meaningful, but never overdone.But seriously, the biggest standout for me is the direction. Anderson made some bold choices with this film, and I respect that so much. It's not trying to be safe or conventional. It's raw, surreal, and almost meditative in some places. You can tell he had a very clear vision - and he committed to it 100%. That takes guts. And the result? A film that actually feels like an experience, not just something you watch and forget.There's this one scene - no spoilers - where Gray Alys is just walking across an endless, icy wasteland, her cloak blowing in the wind, nothing but silence around her. It gave me chills. That's when I knew I wasn't just watching a movie - I was witnessing art.Is it for everyone? Probably not. If you're looking for a classic action-packed fantasy with dragons and battles every five minutes, this might not be it. But if you love stories that take their time, that make you think, feel, and question - this is one you don't want to miss.So yeah. Hats off to Paul W. S. Anderson.

In this future, there is only one city that is run by an Overlord/King and his Queen and they have a religious team of enforcers that work for the Overlord-some don't agree with him but they work for him. The Overlord is dying and the Queen has her own plans on running things. Everything else is a wasteland that has individual pockets of people, like a rest stop for travelers or a country styled store for supplies. Milla plays a witch/sorceress that is summoned by Amara-the Queen-to grant her a wish for power. Amara wants to be a shapeshifter and there just happens to be one in the Lost Lands. Milla has a reputation of never turning anyone down, as long as they pay her and she agrees to it so she hires Dave-a hunter-as a guide and they head out. Arly is an enforcer for the religious team that is sent after Milla because they don't like witches and they want to kill Milla-without the Overlord's blessings. It's co written by George R. R. Martin.It's rated R for violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.Lots of good fights along the trip but the story has a few holes in it. If you can ignore them, you might enjoy the movie, like I did. I would buy it on DVD.",

Twilight run, no one other in theatre, 2010 visial effects, Dave tries to act, Mila just tries something, no sure it is working but fine. Some views/frames or shots, usualy distant or basic look fine, 2 last transitions ok(with moon and days). Fights consists of cuts, somewhat dissapponting. Some effects of rocks look bad. I like the colour gamma, sepia type. The whole film makes impression like it should be released like 15 years ago or be like b tier entertainment in sense, that it should be like a game, maybe with some VR. If you expect any seriousness or anything that doesn't contain bull****, that you are wrong way. You know the film starts with absurd type ****, when someone just goes to Jovovich and asks her something, AND RIGHT AFTER THAT the other guy asks to CANCEL THAT WISH and witch agrees because( i know, here expect me to write \"because f\"** you\" and not like you wrong) SHE ALWAYS AGREES. My god that was good! At least it was better than first version of Rebel Moon(but honestly it hard to find anything worse)",

He strikes the perfect balance between a high-energy action hero and a charismatic, classy persona.

His journey is compelling, making the audience root for him throughout.Kajal Aggarwal's role in Sikandar is impactful and beautifully written. She isn't just a typical love interest; her character has depth, and her presence adds emotional weight to the narrative. She shares a great on-screen chemistry with Salman, making their moments together truly memorable. Her performance is subtle yet powerful, and she plays a crucial part in the movie's emotional core.One of the strongest aspects of Sikandar is its music and background score. Santhosh Narayanan has done a phenomenal job in setting the mood for the film. The songs are chartbusters, each blending seamlessly with the movie's theme, and the BGM elevates every scene. Whether it's a high-energy fight sequence or a deeply emotional moment, the music complements the visuals perfectly. The theme track of Sikandar is bound to stay in fans' minds for a long time.Overall amazing film go and watch with you family.",

Almost every second of the movie felt like he was forced to act, and not like there is anyone in Bollywood who can force Salman Khan. Clearly shows he has no interest in acting anymore. Also the writers should try something different, again all similar storyline of B-wood. Dailogues felt pretty unreal, Rashmika also seem like she was reading the dailogues off a book lol, not even a single good delivery. Entire film felt like a disaster in terms of acting, thanks to Kajal saving some acting in second half. The film is a great product for Mass Action loving audience, not for core cinema lovers. Has a weak storyline, whole lot of flaws, and ofcourse no logic in fight scenes. One time entertainer as a mass action film nothing else.",

The way the film builds its narrative, with each scene adding to the overall progression, is a key strength that elevates it above his previous films.PerformanceSalman Khan's performance in this film is undoubtedly one of his best.

The camaraderie with his co-stars feels natural, and together they create some of the most memorable moments of the film.

        "title": "Sikandar - The Only Movie Where Salman's Face Has More VFX Than the Avengers",
        "content": "Sikandar: The Worst Movie of the Decade - Even Bullets Couldn't Escape the Stupidity!Bollywood has given us disasters before-Race 3, Radhe, Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan-but Sikandar is in a league of its own. If you thought Salman Khan had hit rock bottom, he just borrowed a JCB and started digging deeper.Forget Avatar and Baahubali, Sikandar deserves an award for \"Best Use of CGI to Make an Actor Look Younger (and Still Failing).\" The VFX team worked overtime, yet Salman's face keeps shifting between Maine Pyar Kiya and Madame Tussauds Wax Museum Reject. At times, his face looks so smooth you'd think it was buffed with sandpaper, and in other scenes, the CGI forgets to load, leaving us staring at a man who's clearly lived through multiple decades but refuses to admit it.And then there's Mandharika, a heroine so young next to Salman that their romantic moments feel like a family-friendly festival ad gone horribly wrong. Every time she smiles at him, audiences expect her to say: \"Papa, mujhe naye school bag chahiye!\" (Dad, I want a new school bag!). Their chemistry is so awkward that even an arranged marriage couple meeting for the first time would look more convincing.The action sequences deserve a separate obituary. If you love slow motion, this movie will be your personal torture chamber. Every punch takes so long to land that by the time Salman's fist reaches the villain's face, fuel prices have gone up again. The final fight is so slow that people went to the washroom, ordered food, and came back-all before the next frame loaded.But the biggest highlight of this cinematic garbage fire? The bulletproof steel sheet scene. In one jaw-droppingly dumb moment, Salman hides behind a thin, flimsy tin roof sheet-the kind people use for cheap shop shutters-and somehow, BULLETS CAN'T PENETRATE IT. Yes, full-speed bullets fired by trained henchmen get stopped by a material that even a light breeze can shake. Apparently, this sheet is stronger than Captain America's shield, and Salman hides behind it like a kid playing peekaboo. At this point, the audience had given up on physics, logic, and their will to live. If only they sold bulletproof helmets for people watching this movie.The story itself is a medical science horror show. The plot revolves around organ donation, but the logic behind it is so mind-numbingly stupid that even a 5th grader would call it out. Salman's wife donates her heart, lungs, and God knows what else, and magically, every single recipient shows up in the movie. The best part? The same doctor performs every transplant-heart, lungs, kidney, liver-he's a one-man Apollo Hospital! One scene features a 30-year-old woman's lungs being transplanted into a 9-year-old boy. How did they fit? Who cares! Apparently, Salman's world operates on USB plug-and-play organ transplants.And then, the dialogues. Oh, the dialogues! If bad writing was a crime, Sikandar's script would get life imprisonment. Some absolute gems:Villain: \"Mujhe koi nahi hara sakta!\" (No one can defeat me!)Salman: \"Jab tak Sikandar hai, tab tak zindagi ka calendar nahi badlega!\" (As long as Sikandar is here, life's calendar won't change!)\nCalendar ka kya kasoor tha, bhai? (What did the poor calendar do to you?)Mandharika (to Salman): \"Mujhe tumse ishq ho gaya hai!\" (I have fallen in love with you!)\nAudience reaction: \"Didi, Rakhi ka festival toh August mein hota hai!\" (Sister, Rakhi festival is in August!)And just when you think this cinematic punishment is over, comes the climax. After two and a half hours of painfully slow action, cringeworthy dialogues, and science-defying nonsense, Salman faces off against the villain. We expect an epic conclusion. What do we get?Salman forgives him.YES. After all the build-up, the speeches, the bulletproof tin sheet stupidity, Salman just says: \"Main tujhe maaf karta hoon.\" (I forgive you.)At this point, the villain himself looked confused-he probably felt cheated for even participating in this nonsense. Meanwhile, the audience was ready to riot. Even the Race 3 climax looked like The Dark Knight compared to this.Final verdict? If Bollywood had an official \"Worst Movie Ever\" trophy, Sikandar would win in all categories. Compared to this, Radhe and Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan look like Oscar-winning films. If you love self-inflicted torture, go ahead and watch it. If not, run while you still can.⭐ Rating: -5/5 stars (Extra negative points for making bullets look weaker than plastic spoons.)",

That's exactly how I felt after watching Sikandar-except I never actually napped, because the movie wouldn't let me. Not with its relentless lack of plot, bizarre dialogues, and action sequences that made me question the laws of physics.The film apparently has a \"social message,\" but even by the end credits, I was as clueless about it as I am about why I even bought the tickets. Maybe the message was \"Don't waste your time on a Sunday afternoon.\"I took my uncle along, thinking it would be a great bonding experience. At one point, I was seriously considering whether a power cut at the theater would be a blessing in disguise. But no, Sikandar powered through like a relentless telegram from a broker who's looking to short sell.The only silver lining? Ice cream. Post-movie, we drowned our sorrows in frozen desserts, which, unlike Sikandar, actually made sense and left a sweet aftertaste.Final rating: (quater star for the ice cream, none for the movie).",

The film was marketed as an action-packed mass entertainer, but what we actually got was a boring, outdated emotional drama with logicless fights and a weak storyline.Story: The ruler of Rajkot finds himself in conflict with a powerful minister as he sets out on a mission to protect those who have received his late wife's organ donations-determined to keep her legacy alive at any cost. Despite its emotional premise, the execution feels bland and fails to create a meaningful impact.What went wrong?❌ Logicless action scenes - Fights are completely unrealistic, with Salman defeating enemies in the most ridiculous ways. Even for a mass film, it goes overboard.Slow and outdated screenplay - The emotional drama is forced, and the storytelling feels like something from the early 2000s.Misleading marketing - The trailer promised an action-packed entertainer, but the movie is just a stretched-out emotional mess.Zero freshness - The same old formula with nothing new to offer.The only decent part is the music (Zohra Jabeen, Bam Bam Bhole), but even that isn't enough to save the film.Final Verdict: Sikandar is one of Salman Khan's weakest films in recent years. Even hardcore fans might struggle to sit through it. If you expect good action and a strong story, stay away.I suggest you not to waste your time on this movie. Instead rewatch bhajrangi bhaijaan it's 100 times better than sikandarRating: 2/5.",

Very expensive tickets of this Salman Khan movie not worth spending. Camera focus is only Salman Khan but he is the biggest liability of this movie.",

        "title": "A worthy sequel - 8/10",
        "content": "The Accountant 2 continues the story of Christian Wolff, a highly skilled accountant who works with dangerous criminal organizations while dealing with his own secretive past. As a sequel to the 2016 film The Accountant, this movie expands on Wolff's world, blending action, drama, and character development. While the film works hard to improve upon the original, it succeeds in some areas and falls short in others.The plot of The Accountant 2 picks up after the events of the first film, with Wolff trying to lead a quieter life. However, he is pulled back into the dangerous world of crime when a new case comes his way. This time, the case is more personal, forcing him to confront both new enemies and aspects of his past that he had hoped to leave behind. The movie maintains a strong balance of action, suspense, and drama, but it is the emotional depth and the character-driven narrative that really stand out. The exploration of Wolff's past adds a layer of complexity, making the stakes feel more significant than in a typical action film.Ben Affleck returns to play Christian Wolff, delivering a strong and nuanced performance. He skillfully portrays a character that is both cold and calculating but also carries a deep emotional burden. His portrayal of Wolff's struggles, especially his difficulty with social interactions due to his autism, adds depth to the character and keeps the audience invested in his journey. While Affleck is the clear standout, the supporting cast also contributes solid performances, especially Anna Kendrick, who plays an important role in Wolff's life. However, some of the supporting characters feel a bit underdeveloped compared to Wolff's character, which leaves certain relationships feeling less impactful than they could have been.The action scenes in The Accountant 2 are intense and thrilling, maintaining the high-stakes tension that defined the first film. Wolff's skills are showcased in a series of well-choreographed fight sequences that add to the excitement. While the film doesn't rely on nonstop action, it strikes a good balance between moments of suspense and bursts of action, making the story feel grounded rather than purely focused on spectacle. Director Gavin O'Connor does a great job of keeping the film's pacing steady, allowing the plot to unfold naturally while also ensuring the action scenes are exciting and engaging.A key strength of The Accountant 2 is its exploration of themes like mental health, trauma, and personal identity. Wolff's character, who is portrayed as someone with autism, is given much more depth in this sequel. The film shows that individuals with disabilities can be complex and multidimensional, which is refreshing in a genre often dominated by one-dimensional action heroes. The movie also delves into Wolff's childhood and his strained relationship with his family, offering more context for his actions and his personal struggles. These emotional layers give the action scenes more meaning, as viewers can better understand why Wolff behaves the way he does.At around two hours, the film doesn't feel overly long, but there are moments when the pacing slows down, particularly during scenes that focus on character development. For some viewers, these slower moments might feel like a drag, especially if they are more interested in the action. However, for those who appreciate a deeper exploration of character, these moments offer important insights into Wolff's psyche. It's a balance that may not appeal to everyone, but it works well for those invested in the character's journey.Overall, The Accountant 2 is a solid sequel that builds on the strengths of the first film while adding new layers of complexity. The emotional depth, character development, and intense action make it an engaging watch. Ben Affleck's performance as Christian Wolff continues to impress, and the movie does a good job of expanding on his backstory and struggles. While the pacing can be slow at times, the film remains compelling due to its mix of action and emotional storytelling. For fans of the first film or anyone who enjoys character-driven action movies, The Accountant 2 is definitely worth watching.I would rate The Accountant 2 at 4 out of 5 stars. It's a strong sequel that improves upon the original in many ways, while still offering enough intrigue and action to keep viewers entertained. Even for those who haven't seen the first film, The Accountant 2 offers enough to stand on its own. The movie is a well-crafted blend of suspense, action, and emotional depth, making it a worthwhile experience.",

        "content": "The Gorge is the kind of movie that hooks you in with a solid mystery-thriller-romance setup, only to fumble the ball when it matters most. The first half actually works. There's a strong intrigue surrounding the characters, the suspense feels tangible, and the slow-burn tension keeps you invested. The whole anticipation of their connection is arguably more engaging than the actual payoff, but it's still handled well enough. The creature designs are fantastic. The film has some nice visuals, too. There's this eerie atmosphere with rain, lightning, and fog that adds a lot to the mood. It also blends genres in an interesting way, blending horror, sci-fi, and thriller elements while keeping romance at its core. And yeah, you can see clear pulls from Aliens, Annihilation, and even fun little winks to Whiplash and The Queen's Gambit, which is a nice touch. But as the film starts revealing its cards, it gets increasingly clunky. Some of the plotting feels forced, and there's this overkill of familiar tropes that makes things predictable. The dialogue, which was already nothing special, really dries up in the second half, leaving a lot of moments feeling hollow.Anya Taylor-Joy, unsurprisingly, delivers. She's got that natural screen presence that makes any role more engaging. Miles Teller is decent, too, and their chemistry is okay but nothing extraordinary. The problem is, as soon as the mystery starts unraveling, the story just kind of deflates. There's a point where you can feel the movie losing its grip as if it doesn't know how to maintain the intrigue it worked so hard to build. The tension fades, the pacing gets sluggish, and by the time it reaches the ending, it's clear the film just doesn't stick the landing. The final moment is pretty bad. It's a shame because the movie had something going. It had cool ideas, solid visuals, and a unique mix of genres. But by the end, it's like watching a magic trick where the setup is great, but the reveal is just... disappointing. A solid start, a frustrating fall, and an ending that leaves you feeling like you sat through something that could've been a lot better.",

They've got great chemistry, and you actually care about their characters. Zach Dean's script is sharp-imaginative, funny, scary, and surprisingly emotional.And the score?

        "content": "I saw early ads for this and was really looking forward to it. The first half or so lived up to the hype.When filmmakers try to provide something for everyone - romance, action, horror and heroism - they often fail. This movie starts to come closer to succeeding than most, but then is hampered by a ridiculously weak second half full of tropes, lazy writing and a ridiculous ending.In the first half, we have two interesting characters, both loners, both smart, both talented, getting to know each other across a gorge that acts both as a physical barrier and a metaphor for the fear of getting close to another person. Full of charming moments - The Ramones, dancing, chess, poetry and old-school getting-to-know-each-other-slowly - the first half is promising. Both leads are beautiful and the camera lingers delightfully, but not too long. The characters seem to have personalities and brains.In the second half, as soon as the characters enter a big old bunker in the gorge and efforts are made to provide an explanation of what the gorge is and how it came to be, all of sudden it's like the writers go on strike. Instead of letting the story unfold, we are subjected to extensive and inexplicable mansplaining from Miles' character. Instead of storytelling, the screenwriters just run out of steam and have him suddenly and with no good reason do a lot of talking, Instead of showing what happened, the screenwriters just have Miles' character tell us. At length. It's no longer him and Drasa working together to figure it out. It's no longer the screenwriters showing the audience what happened through flashbacks or backstory or a slow discovery. It's just Miles inexplicably figuring it out and telling us. No curiosity, no buy-in, nothing interesting at all. Just very lazy writing.Was the film running over budget? Did the screenwriter have another project to work on? What happened? It has a final-season-of-Game-of-Thrones-tanking feel. Or like every single Katherine Hepburn Spencer Tracy movie complying with the Hays Code in which a great film gets ruined in the last ten minutes. And that final scene.... puh-leez! Our hero ends up dressed in white lace working as a waitress? For realzies? What were the writers thinking?Hopefully someday someone with better writing skills will redo this. It's not a bad concept, just poorly executed.Do yourself a favor - watch the first half. Then, as soon as Drasa walks into the bunker at the bottom of the wall in the gorge, make yourself turn it off and write your own ending.",

The plot and setting blend elements of The Mist, Maze Runner, Silent Hill, and Wolfenstein. I mention Wolfenstein because, true to the title, the second half of the movie feels like watching a video game you can't control.It's not aiming to win any Oscars, but the acting is solid and the story is entertaining. I appreciated the main two actors, they do a good job bringing energy and fun to their roles. Even though the trailer gives away much of the premise, the film still has a few surprises. It takes about 30 minutes for the action to gear up, but once it does it delivers. There are noticeable lulls between the more exciting sequences, the pacing was a bit slow to me. Overall, if you can embrace its outlandish premise, this flick makes for a thrilling, video game style watch.",

        "content": "First of all, the concept itself was fresh, and the romance between the two main characters was decent. Above all, the movie didn't feel boring even after about two hours, and the acting wasn't bad either. Initially, I thought the movie would be a fantasy monster film or one with aliens, as the trailer mentioned a monster. However, this film is actually a sci-fi action romance based entirely on scientific conspiracy theories.That said, there were some parts in the middle where the plausibility was lacking, and the plot wasn't as meticulously crafted as it could have been, which made me lower my rating. Overall, though, it's still a movie worth watching.This kind of action-romance film usually brings to mind the old-fashioned notion of chivalry, where a man is expected to sacrifice himself unilaterally for a woman. However, in an era where both men and women enlist in the military regardless of gender, such clichés feel outdated and old-school. What makes this film truly moving is that both the man and the woman sincerely and coolly sacrifice for each other, overcoming hardships together.Last but not least, the idea of characters in a movie sharing love and hinting at the future through poetry and quotes really resonated with me, and it made me want to indulge in poetry again. In this age of AI content creation, it felt like a classic yet refreshing approach.",

The creatures (several different types!) are freaking awesome and so unique/wonderfully bizarre!Initially i wasn't thrilled the movie was rated PG-13 (or whatever) but this movie really doesn't need an R rating nor did it need blood/gore.

It comes to Apple TV on February 14th and stars Anya Taylor Joy, Miles Teller, and Sigourney Weaver. It tells the story of two elite snipers who are sent to guard opposite sides of a mysterious gorge without knowing what is in the gorge. The first hour of the film was solid and enjoyable as we're introduced to the two leads and see how they're living their day-to-day lives in their outposts and eventually how they start to communicate and get to know each other. It's that first hour, with the solid introductions to the characters that helps this film hold up for me, because the second half of the story doesn't feel as strong. After that first hour, the two are suddenly thrust into survival mode as they battle unknown forces in an ominous setting. Eventually, they figure out what's going on and it doesn't really feel like anything new or super unique. We've all seen these types of situations in sci-fi/horror movies so it's unfortunate something that started off as strong as this film did ended up feeling a bit ... generic and predictable by the time it was over. I didn't hate it by any means. It was a fun way to pass two hours. But there's a part of me that had expected a bit more, so that was a scoch disappointing.

Her father is dying. She's going to go on a mission and he's going to die while she's away. This makes her further sad. Okay said woman is very sad because sniper and because father dying. Got it.When she gets to the Gorge she starts smiling at Teller and wants to dance because it's her birthday. Puts on the Ramones and Bops around. I thought she was sad. Everything we saw about her up until now is sad. But now she dances. Makes no sense.Miles gets parachuted into the area. Lands on the ground. Then climbs up a mountain. Why on Earth would you not land on top? No explanation. I'll tell you why because they wanted to show him climbing up the mountain.He lands basically with the clothes on his back. Presumably she did too. Yet there's a fully stocked bunker. Every night monsters attack kind of like Dawn of the Dead. Thousands and thousands of rounds of ammunition are expended. Landmines. Hand grenades. Lots of heavy Hardware. Where did this stuff come from? The place has been running for a year without deliveries. In time we realize it's been running for 80 years without deliveries.There's no road. Nothing is parachuted in. Where does all the stuff come from? Every day he's out there repairing the fence with a welder torch. Putting up new land mines. Reloading the automatic turrets. Where does all this hardware come from?Hell where does the toilet paper come from?Are they supposed to wear the clothes that they came with everyday for a year?Anya has a uniform clearly tailored to her female form. Definitely not standard issue military dungarees. How did this clothing arrive at the place?During the movie hundreds of monsters are destroyed. Apparently this has been going on for 80 years. Eventually we find out that these are the initial guys from 80 years ago who have mutated because reasons.So these tree men have been living down there for 80 years and getting killed off hundreds at a time. So if we lose like a thousand a year then that would have been 80,000 men. But apparently only like 2400 went down initially. Makes no sense.None of it makes any sense. Anya is brooding and then she's flirtatious.The movie is a train wreck of logic. I didn't find any of it believable. A great deal of it didn't make any sense whatsoever.

We've all seen this formula before: a central character that some Government agency decides that they can't do without (and won't take \"no\" for an answer), and recruits her to carry out a \"failure is not an option\" mission. It's nicely set up for a \"mission of the week\" schedule which, to be honest, I really don't mind. I think the lead actress does a serviceable job, and the first episode had a nice twist in the end.All in all, I'm going to continue watching this show. It has enough possibilities to keep me interested and the cast is engaging enough. Although if network history holds true, they'll cancel this series just after you've became a faithful viewer.",

For that to work the characters have to be interesting and the storyline needs to have at least a modicum of believability. This fails on both. I remember watching the lead actress Melissa Roxburgh in Manifest and feeling the same thing. She seems like a very nice person but acting is not her forte. She speaks with urgency but lacks conviction in her delivery. I don't know if any amount of acting classes can cure that. The pace and story is typical police procedural. Main character, Roxburgh, getting back in the fold but not quite sure if they want the job. They seemingly solve the mystery long before the show ends so you can see the plot twist coming a mile away. One bright spot on the show is Nick Wechsler who plays Oliver on the show. He's one of the best actors around. He's been in numerous series and played Jack Porter in 'Revenge' . There's a scene in that show where his dog passes away. He did such a realistic perfomance that the lead actress was even crying. She fed off of his energy and showed some real emotion for the first time in that show's history. There is always a chance this show could get better if they switch out writers for each episode since most of the actors are fairy talented except for the lead but I'm not holding my breath.",

This show The Hunting Party could be that one if it tried harder and didn't look so cheap. There's lots of potential here. The female lead, who grew up onscreen in the Wimpy Kid movies, is confident and beautiful. But she's given wooden dialogue and fake looking special effects to work with. For some reason she's former FBI brought in from a casino job to catch killers on the loose from a hidden prison. Inside it, the villains inside look they're waiting for their next turn on a really bad version of the game show The Wall. After a cheesy explosion, the bad guys escape everywhere and nobody else survives, except the mysterious warden. So there's probably gonna be a criminal of the week. Sorta like Alcatraz. Except here, the good guys pursue them in a luxury jet, provided by the government? What?! My taxes pay for this?? Anyway, with more plot holes than a spaghetti colander, this show could be great if the writers took a writing class. Also, some of the escaped prisoners could be based on real people back from the dead like Lee Harvey Oswald. Conspiracy theories could fly here! Good luck to the Hunting Party team, you're gonna need it if you're not cancelled by NBC.",

I had high expectations, hoping that her involvement would bring something unique or captivating to the table. However, after watching the first episode, I found myself incredibly disappointed, particularly with her script selection. It's not often that I feel let down by someone whose career I respect, but in this case, the writing just didn't do her-or the show-justice.What's especially surprising to me is that, in this day and age, when there are countless high-quality shows, producers are still willing to invest so much in projects with such a mediocre plot. With all the competition out there, it seems baffling that such a lackluster story would be given the green light. Television has evolved in so many ways, and audiences are more discerning than ever. We now have access to a broad range of content, from gripping dramas to thought-provoking sci-fi, and in an era where streaming services and on-demand content dominate, it's shocking that producers are still backing shows that feel formulaic and uninspired. It's almost as if they're choosing to play it safe with a basic, uninspiring plot, hoping that the star power or the production value will carry the show, rather than focusing on solid writing and engaging storytelling.Rather than backing shows like the one I just watched, which doesn't seem to add anything new to the TV landscape, producers could instead revive shows that were much more entertaining and captivating in their prime. For instance, Lie to Me and The Mentalist were excellent examples of shows that provided engaging, \"popcorn entertainment\"-easy to watch, yet clever and intriguing. They struck the right balance of compelling plots, charismatic leads, and interesting twists, all while keeping the audience entertained without overwhelming them with too much complexity. Shows like these are still remembered fondly by fans because they knew how to keep their audience engaged without sacrificing quality.Once again- terribly disappointed, but will give episode 2 a try as well n dats it.",

        "title": "Should have been a special episode of Falcon and the Winter Soldier",
        "content": "The MCU is currently a mixed-bag of incredible and downright mediocre films with its Multiverse shenanigans. Captain America: Brave New World is a return to a more grounded, political thriller-style narrative, reminiscent of The Winter Soldier. While it doesn't quite match the tension and sharp storytelling of the original Captain America trilogy, there's enough intrigue to keep the plot moving.That said, the film plays things a little too safe, resulting in a familiar, by-the-numbers MCU entry that lacks the surprises fans may be hoping for.One of the more interesting aspects of the film is its unexpected role as a pseudo-sequel to 2008's The Incredible Hulk. Seeing familiar faces return after such a massive gap is a nice touch, but it also raises a potential issue: newer fans might feel lost when characters suddenly appear with little explanation. It's an unusual creative choice that rewards longtime viewers while potentially alienating others.Harrison Ford, stepping into the role of Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross, is easily one of the film's highlights. The man is a legend, and he carries his scenes with a commanding presence that proves why he's a pop culture icon. There's not a moment where he seems like he's phoning it in, and his performance adds a level of gravitas to the movie. On the other hand, Giancarlo Esposito, an actor who thrives in villainous roles, is criminally underutilized. His brief moments on screen are strong, but it's frustrating knowing how much more he could have brought to the table with a larger role.Anthony Mackie continues his journey as Captain America, and while he fully embodies the character's ideals, he doesn't quite have the larger-than-life presence needed to carry a major MCU film. This could be a matter of personal perception, but something about his performance feels more suited for television, making the film feel like an extended episode of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier rather than a proper cinematic leap. The themes of legacy and responsibility are appreciated, yet they don't hit with the impact they should.The action in this film is serviceable but ultimately underwhelming, especially when compared to the hard-hitting, minimal-cut, steady camerawork that the Russo brothers perfected in The Winter Soldier and Civil War. The fights here feel more generic, relying on quick cuts and shaky camera movements that dilute the impact of each sequence. It's not necessarily bad-it just doesn't leave a lasting impression, which is disappointing for a character whose best moments have been defined by grounded, brutal, and tactically impressive combat.Ultimately, Captain America: Brave New World feels like a film that would have thrived during the earlier phases of the MCU but struggles to stand out in the current era. There's something missing-perhaps the spectacle, perhaps the unexpected twists, or maybe it's just the overall sense that Marvel fatigue is setting in. Watching it feels a bit like sitting through a weaker episode of a great TV show-necessary for the overarching story, but not particularly exciting on its own.6 out of 10.",

The action felt tedious to follow.It's as if the writers threw together a series of tropes without any regard for coherence or originality.Mackie's portrayal of Sam Wilson lacks the charisma and gravitas needed for the mantle of Cap.His performance is wooden and uninspired, making it difficult to invest in his character's journey. Plus we have to act as if we care for his sidekick...the new falcon... didn't bother to learn his name.Ford, usually a powerhouse, seems disinterested and it's obvious he came to collect a paycheck. Plus why would you cast a 80 plus nearby to grave for a character that is properly re introduced.The film's pacing is atrocious, dragging in parts where it should be thrilling and rushing through moments that could have provided emotional resonance.The action sequences are uninspired, lacking the creativity and excitement that we expect.As usual the secondary or primary ( depends how you see it) antagonist is worthless whereas if used correctly he could have been a seriously dangerous threat. Earth's mightiest heroes the tv series had awesome portrayal of the character in a handful of episodes.The VFX is trash with several scenes appearing blatantly artificial.

It felt like it was being used as an excuse to introduce new dynamics and catapult upcoming releases and potential projects (IDF woman, Bucky in Thunderbolts*, the new Falcon) rather than focusing on the Captain America character. Both the Winter Soldier & Falcon show as well as the trailers made it seem like this movie had specific intentions for the new Captain America, but the movie fell flat and didn't tell us anything we didn't already know about Sam. Despite the possible consequences, the villains wound up feeling low stakes and impersonal. The most interesting characters had the least screen time, and it was overall disappointing compared to the show that preceded it.",

        "content": "Very hard to review this movie without spoiling, but to summerise this is not as bad as I thought. There are a few weird cuts, a couple of nonsensical story-beats, very weird editing at times and an end credit scene which is just meh (only one btw). But movie-wise this is... almost okay, I would say.There are good ideas here, which has been lacking in Marvel recently so despite my score and critique I will praise the studio for at least trying something. Failed try, but a try nevertheless.The positives: this is decently entertaining, decently fun with good acting. I would rank this middle- to Low comes to Marvel movies, ahead of Black Widow, but worse than The Marvels... And, I think the music and sound design was great.With that said the movie also have a lot of negatives. The main problem is what they tried to do. They want this to be a 'Winter Soldier'-like movie, sprinkled with some Incredible Hulk sequel. But both of those movies are far better and so this movie's story does not hold up. I think they should have gone down a different road and let this movie be its own thing. Another issue is that the movie drags and have pacing issues, which is sort of weird since the movie is only about 1 hour and 40min of actual run-time (movie is 2hrs officially). I actually think this movie should have been 25min longer to make scenes breath a little. But due to pacing and content the movie almost becomes boring. Almost all of these problems is likely due to all the reshoots and re-writes we've heard about.There are sadly also more problems. The overuse of CG for one, especially since it is not always done well either. How come Iron Man and the early MCU movies still, to this day, have better computer graphics than today's Marvel? Don't Marvel care anymore?And who came up with the main opposition to US? Really? A vassal will fight their master and superpower? Yea, right. Also, who is that Israeli child? What was the point with her character?Overall though, as a movie, I give it a 3/10. In one month no one will ever care about this movie.Worth your money? Maybe. Some of you are likely to enjoy this movie, or at least more than I did but I will not recommend.",

        "title": "Captain America: Brave New World, meh - 6/10",
        "content": "I went into Captain America: Brave New World with low expectations, especially after all the negative publicity. But I decided to approach it as a straight-up action movie-and in that sense, it was okay. It was entertaining and somewhat enjoyable for what it was, but the movie had its fair share of flaws.The Story:\nThe plot felt rushed, and while it had some interesting connections to The Eternals, it lacked depth. There were noticeable editing issues, and the script felt average at best. The villains was forgettable, which is a huge missed opportunity because a hero is only as good as their villains. The Red Hulk storyline, which had so much potential, was underutilized and felt wasted.The Character.* Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America): Mackie carried the film and was a definite highlight. He's an underrated actor who did the best he could with the material he was given. His performance felt genuine, and he brought heart to the role.* Danny Ramirez (Joaquin Torres: A pleasant surprise! Ramirez played Joaquin Torres well and showed good chemistry with Mackie. I hope they continue building his character as Captain America's sidekick.* Harrison Ford (Thunderbolt Ross Red Hulk): Ford is a legend, but he looked uncomfortable in the role. At 83, it's understandable that such a physically demanding character might be tough to portray. If they plan to continue the Red Hulk storyline, they may need to consider a recast or a different approach to the character.* Shira Haas (Ruth Bat-Seraph): Haas is a okay actress, but she didn't feel like the right fit for this character. She gave it her all, but something about her performance felt off. Maybe it was the writing or direction, and it seems like she was trying way too hard to act tough, taking on men twice her size was not believable, but either way. The character didn't connect, it was a pointless character to have in the movie.The Action:The action scenes were not bad, with some well-choreographed fights and high-paced sequences that kept it fun. But the editing issues were hard to ignore, with some moments feeling choppy or out of place.The Missed Opportunities:\nThe biggest letdown was the Red Hulk storyline. They introduced such a powerful character but barely scratched the surface of his potential. Also, the villains lacked presence, which hurt the overall impact of the movie.Final Thoughts:\nCaptain America: Brave New World is worth watching when it comes out on streaming service, if you're looking for a okay action movie. Just don't expect anything groundbreaking from the story or villains. It's entertaining, but it feels rushed and underdeveloped. Hopefully, if they make a sequel, they'll slow down, tighten the script, and develop a stronger villain like MODOK or Zemo could be amazing if done right!Rating: 6/10 - Watch it for the action and Anthony Mackie's performance, but don't expect it to blow you away.",

        "content": "\"Captain America: Brave New World\" is a disappointing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, failing to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The film's plot is a convoluted mess, attempting to blend political intrigue with superhero action but succeeding in neither. The narrative is riddled with clichés and lacks any real depth or originality.Anthony Mackie's portrayal of Sam Wilson as the new Captain America is uninspired, offering little to no character development. His performance feels wooden, and the script does him no favors with its lackluster dialogue and forced humor. The chemistry between characters is virtually non-existent, making it difficult to invest in their relationships or motivations.The action sequences, a staple of Marvel films, are surprisingly dull and poorly choreographed. The CGI is subpar, with certain scenes appearing almost cartoonish. The film's pacing is erratic, dragging in parts where it should be thrilling and rushing through moments that could have provided emotional weight.Harrison Ford's role as President Thaddeus Ross is a rare bright spot, but even his seasoned performance can't salvage the film from its myriad flaws. The villains are forgettable, with motivations that are either unclear or utterly unconvincing.In summary, \"Captain America: Brave New World\" is a lackluster effort that fails to capture the spirit and excitement of earlier entries in the franchise. It's a film that feels more like a contractual obligation than a passionate storytelling endeavor. Marvel fans deserve better.",

        "content": "I had low expectations - after some of the recent MCU films, who wouldn't? - but this didn't even meet those. I enjoyed Falcon & Winter Soldier and this was an unworthy follow-up.The film had a lot of problems, but they were self-inflicted. Connecting back to 2008's Incredible Hulk and Eternals and F&WS and Infinity War/Endgame required a lot of weak exposition and this failed in making us care about the brought-back characters. Sam's main motivation was hit-us-over-the-head obvious but why he cared was barely apparent, relying too heavily on viewers recollections of F&WS. The film was so burdened with these callbacks that it lacked any sense of its own present day and what motivated Sam.I thought Anthony Mackie gave a solid performance but the screenplay didn't give him much light and shade to work with - in F&WS he shone when he got to be more playful. Harrison Ford's performance was awfully hammy and completely unconvincing as either a President or former general as was Shira Haas. She was completely miscast and under-developed in the film. This character combo made a good third of the film seem a bit silly at best. Giancarlo Esposito was unwritten and wasted and I have yet to understand what is meant to be interesting about Danny Ramirez's character, and this film didn't change that. To be fair, this all points to the biggest problems which were not the actors as such but the convoluted, unengaging plot and the crummy screenplay they had to try to sell. It was hard not to wonder if the kept adding extra characters to the film to try to make the story it work but if so this wasn't a successful strategy.Avoiding spoilers, the plot had a good kernel of an idea but the dramatic choices made failed at every step to translate this into a compelling story where there were clear stakes we cared about. Things moved at a good pace, but without any real drama or excitement along the way. The film failed to give us or the characters a real mystery, a twist, or any revelations - partly because the trailers had spoiled most of it. It was meant to be Cap unravelling a master puzzle by a shadowy genius but basically they fitted about four clues together and the villain kept explaining what he was doing the whole time. Again, without spoilers, by the end it seemed like there was a much, much simpler way for the villain to have accomplished his goal. His approach seemed pretty dumb.Last but not least, the dialogue writing was atrocious throughout the film. Dialogue that was meant to establish characters and relationships felt forced and attempts at humour fell consistently flat. Exposition abounded. And as the film progressed, characters were given cheesy homilies to deliver about what it all meant and what they'd learned in what were probably the cringiest MCU moments I can think of - the sort of guff the MCU has generally avoided wisely. Overall, it's aspirations to be a smart political thriller were dashed on the fact it's just not a very clever or convincing film. It certainly had nothing to new or deep to say about politics and in fact wasted a prime opportunity to send-up a certain intemperate President.On a technical note, the VFX were generally okay, but uninspiring. The flight sequences were well-executed. I found the Red Hulk VFX to be totally cartoonish and unconvincing though, which again undermined any attempt at this being a serious political thriller.I'd hoped to be pleasantly surprised but instead I'm pretty annoyed with Marvel for serving up another dud. How can they spend so much effort on something so unremarkable without realising and correcting? As with The Marvels, the end-credit scene was way more interesting than the rest of the film, but only by comparison. But their future promises are getting harder to believe.",

        "content": "Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) seems to have found his footing with the moniker of Captain America, and created an intriguing fusion between the physical capabilities of the shield as well as Wilson's extensive experience with those wings. He has created a modern imagining of our favourite golden boy and he carries the weight of it well. This film isn't without its flaws, however I maintain an open mind as we are heralded into a new story for a new generation of the MCU.Wilson soon finds himself thrust into a world of controversy and political unrest as the new President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) attempts to control the nation with a War General's order, leading with intensive military intervention and action instead of stepping back to see the wider picture. His action, he believes, are his own, but it's soon apparent that a third party is responsible for bringing forth the near destruction of peace between nations.This film appears to be modelling itself after the 70s conspiracy thriller that set the tone for Cap's second film, The Winter Solider, and while this film begins in a solid place, it loses some serious steam mid second act, just following the realisation of the truth. The final fight sequence between Cap and the Red Hulk quickly fizzles out, and the bristling nerve of rage shrinks away just sharply as it appeared. The plot feels quite cohesive, if not a little mellow in comparison to the threat carried by previous villains seen in the MCU. I didn't really feel a lot of dangers surrounding our titular hero, even though tragedy does befall his protégé.Sam Wilson is an admiral hero, his struggles feel like our struggles and for a man who doesn't have the unshakable and undeniable abilities that Steve Rogers had, he sure does hold his own in a fight. This film doesn't rely on explosive fight sequences but instead has an accumulating storyline, which does feel whole, if not a little rocky. The idea of a new team of Avengers is also brought up early in the film, with Sam leading the possible new team, and while we may never feel the same energy as we did with the previous collection of beloved characters, it doesn't mean that a fresh collaboration are to be dismissed out of hand.Overall, I think this film has gained a lot unnecessary negative attention, and a large amount of it isn't really founded. Anthony Mackie leads in a strong performance, balancing all the elements of a complex character like Captain America, like the quiet resolution, strong emotional intelligence and the explosive energy and control in the power displayed during fight sequences. I hope to see him continue to play Cap with the sense of grounded nature that he has graced the character with.Bucky said it best in a well timed and placed cameo appearance to offer up some sage wisdom for a faltering hero, \"Steve gave them hope, you give them something to aspire to.\" (Paraphrased)",

Let's get this over with.The performances were alright. Harrison Ford was definitely the standout in this film. I was expecting him to just phone it in, but he actually puts in the work. Not his best work, but enough to make me like his version of Thaddeus Ross. Anthony Mackie is great as always, but is honestly given very little. I'm not entirely sure Sam had a character arc outside of one scene late into the film and even that is just rehashing what happened in a D+ show. Giancarlo Esposito was absolutely wasted. Clearly added in later and could easily be cut.As for the plot, there's nothing new here I'm afraid. It feels like this film's only purpose was to introduce Adamantium to the MCU. The antagonist is terrible, they try to connect it to earlier MCU entries but no one is really going to remember. This film was clearly altered from what it originally was. It's difficult to talk about honestly, because it feels like there's nothing here. The film wants to be an espionage thriller like Winter Soldier, but lacks the tonal consistency, tight pacing and writing to even come close.But what about the action? It isn't great. The hand to hand combat looks sluggish and poorly edited. There's a good amount of that throughout. The CGI ranges from decent to downright terrible. It all rings hollow.So yeah, it's probably not the worst thing the MCU has put out, but it certainly isn't far above it. I can't bring myself to hate this film, because it is ultimately nothing.

        "content": "\"Captain America: Brave New World\" brought to life the best of the MCU. Most of the action sequences were sharp and the mystery and tension simmering. By far the greatest triumph of the movie was the heart it allowed its main characters to have and the relationships it built between them.It's grounded in hard truths without sacrificing that classic Cap optimism. Carl Lumbly and Danny Ramirez shine, but Anthony Mackie's infectious empathy is the true MVP of the movie. Harrison Ford is having so much fun and I had fun with him for sure, also the Red Hulk CGI was amazing. Some of the other visual effects could've been perfected, but it's nothing that throw me off. The movie brings an exciting idea for the future of the MCU under Sam Wilson as leader. A pretty solid Cap meets Hulk.On the mixed side of the things it seems that part of the movie exist to wrap up loose ends to \"The Incredible Hulk\" and \"Eternals\" and in doing so, the plot is becoming convoluted and you can feel where some of the reshoots were made.The Leader was a bit underdeveloped in my opinion, same goes for Esposito's chatacter and the dialog was a bit choppy at times. However I liked that this is ground-level MCU film. That's heavy on action and full of political intrigue and as a sequel to some previous movies I think it works.It's great to see Cap back in action. I can watch him sling that shield all day. This definitely feels like the beginning of the next chapter for Captain America, with the film laying groundwork for what's to come in the MCU.\"Captain America: Brave New World\" is an enjoyable watch with decent action sequences and some standout moments. It's nowhere near the overhated scores it gets right now. However, it didn't quite hit the emotional or narrative highs of the previous Cap movies, not that I compared them so much. Loved Mackie as Cap and I appreciated the more serious tone, but it did feel slightly empty at places.",

The cast delivers some charismatic performances particularly Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Captain America. He pours his heart and soul into bringing the best out of his character. Danny Ramirez as Joaquin Torres also delivered a hilarious and delightful performance and his chemistry with Mackie is solid. And Harrison Ford as Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross/\"The Red Hulk\" was one of the highlights of the film. The action sequences were entertaining even though not as mesmerising as they could've been.Now the movie has some obvious flaws. The plot felt rushed, predictable and lacked depth with a lot of story elements feeling underdeveloped. The pacing was extremely uneven. There were moments that felt rushed while others dragged on making the film a little unengaging at times. It tries to match the storytelling heights of the Captain America Trilogy only to fail at it.

If you don't remember the events of this film, don't worry, as Brave New World is chock full of clunky exposition. It also requires you to remember the events of a show that came out in 2021. Without remembering some of these details, certain plot points just lose all their impact and don't carry much weight. Maybe my memory isn't what it used to be, and maybe I should have rewatched The Incredible Hulk and Falcon and the Winter Soldier before watching this, but who has the time for that.Even ignoring these links to previous MCU instalments, the whole plot still feels incredibly messy and all over the place. There is a random collection of new characters all of whom get zero character development. Even Sam Wilson, Cap himself, gets no real development or journey in this film. It's an incredibly bland portrayal of the character, which is a shame given the great journey Steve Rodgers had. Anthony Mackie and Sam Wilson deserves more from his solo projects. Once you muddle through the clumsy link back the Eternals, and the overarching plot that links to The Incredible Hulk, you are still left trying to grapple with other bizarre aspects of the film. Why was a character seemingly central to the story like Sidewinder only added in reshoots? They can spin as much yarn as they like about the reshoots not being material to the film, but they clearly weren't happy with what they had in the can when they finished principal photography and it shows. The plot also felt very fragmented and choppy. Somehow it managed to feel convoluted yet mindlessly simple at the same time. Quite the achievement.Now I will put my positive hat on briefly as there are some good points to this film. Despite being given very little to work with, Anthony Mackie puts in a good performance as Cap. It's clear that he could nail this role if the writing wasn't so poor, so I hope this improves for future outings. His chemistry with the new Falcon is pretty solid and there's some promise there. I do also think the final action scene is suitably chaotic, even if it does fizzle out, and the action throughout is all decent enough if nothing remarkable.Ultimately though I really do think that Marvel has just hit a brick wall. With each film that passes, it becomes more and more apparent that Endgame was the obvious end point. The franchise should have taken a hiatus then kicked off again with a whole new cast and a whole new set of stories. It's a shame as Mackie has been let down by a poor film and poor overall franchise direction, but for Marvel diehards this film will be watchable enough.",

Viewers can anticipate the story's twists and turns without much effort, leading to a lack of genuine suspense or intrigue.

While loyalty is a commendable trait, the film presents this fixation as a self-indulgent distraction from more pressing global issues. In a world teetering on the brink of chaos, Captain America's preoccupation with personal matters comes across as trivial and misguided.Anthony Mackie, stepping into the iconic role, carries a significant burden as he attempts to fill the shoes of his predecessor. While he has a unique charisma that shines through, there are moments where he seems to be trying too hard to emulate Chris Evans' portrayal. This effort sometimes results in a performance that feels less natural, as if he's struggling to find his footing in a role that demands both gravitas and authenticity.Despite these shortcomings, there are glimmers of potential. Mackie's charisma brings a fresh perspective to the character, and his attempts to navigate the pressures of heroism are relatable. However, the overall execution leaves much to be desired, with a narrative that fails to capitalize on its characters' complexities.In conclusion, Captain America: Brave New World is a missed opportunity. It teeters on the edge of meaningful storytelling but ultimately succumbs to predictability and clichés. While the film might entertain fans of the franchise, it lacks the depth and originality necessary to leave a lasting impression. The journey of Captain America deserves more than a formulaic plot; it deserves a narrative that challenges its hero and resonates with its audience on a deeper level.",

Can't believe it fit comfortably at that run time. Even felt a bit like Captain America TWS, a bit of a thriller at times. And the humor (that was not too prevalent) did not feel forced.

Avpromised but delivered [what the movie actually wasThe pacing was sluggish, with long stretches of nothing happening punctuated by jarring, poorly executed action sequences. Ame performance felt phoned in, while character was utterly underdeveloped and pointless. The dialogue was clunky and unnatural, and the plot holes were large enough to drive a truck through. The special effects looked like they were rendered on a potato. This film is a prime example of wasted pot.",

        "content": "At a time when streaming platforms are inundated with content that often feels formulaic, it's rare to encounter a series that grips you with such immediacy and authenticity. This miniseries, which I stumbled upon purely by chance on its premiere day, turned out to be a remarkable discovery-an unassuming masterpiece that exceeded my expectations in every way.What sets this series apart is its unflinchingly unsentimental approach to storytelling. By eschewing overly contrived emotional cues, it allows moments of genuine emotional depth to emerge organically, packing an understated yet profound impact. It's a raw, fast-paced, and intense experience that remains grounded and purposeful, never slipping into excess or artifice.Visually, the series is a triumph. The meticulous attention to detail-whether in the period-accurate costumes, evocative set designs, or the dynamic and immersive camerawork-creates an unparalleled sense of presence. You're not merely observing events unfold from a distance; you're drawn into the action, experiencing the urgency and stakes alongside the characters.While I often find action-heavy narratives reliant on spectacle at the expense of substance, this series defies that trend. Here, the brisk pacing and raw, visceral moments of violence serve as an extension of the story's thematic core, amplifying its authenticity rather than detracting from it.From the first episode, the series establishes a gripping rhythm that's impossible to resist.If this miniseries isn't recognized during awards season, it would be nothing short of an oversight. The precision of its costume design, the evocative score, the sharp direction, and the captivating performance by its lead actress deserve every accolade.In many ways, this is more than just one of the best Netflix offerings in recent memory; it's a reminder of what storytelling can achieve when ambition meets artistry. For an industry that often prioritizes marketability over originality THIS is why I still am a subscriber.",

        "title": "Started so strong... ended stupid and cringey.",
        "content": "This show starts out with an incredible episode. Brutal and griping. That continues in the second episode.Then episode 3 hits, and the story gets bogged down on some weird side story that seems shoehorned in just to allow for some sexual violence and a group of people that may or may not be a leper colony?From there, the show drags quite a bit, plays fast and loose with the true history, and the ends... stupidly. Two of our main characters have a brutal, but unfulfilling end, and the other two suddenly find themselves in some corny teen drama romance ending. It is cringey.Generally, this series is hit or miss. At time it has great, brutal action, but the dialogue is lacking. Particularly with Betty Gilpin who at times has lines and a delivery that couldn't sound more modern if it tried.Overall, there seemed to really be no plot. Everybody is going West... but the Mormons are going to a vague location and Sara and Devin are going to meet the vague \"father\" of Devin. That may or may not have struck it rich in a gold mine.THE SOUNDTRACK: I know that Berg loves Explosions in the Sky... but the Friday Night Lights soundtrack genuinely takes you out of the \"1857-1858\" time frame.TAYLOR KITSCH: What is with Berg always making him die in some traumatic way with the same emotional dramatic music? They build him a funeral pyre?It's just too much cheese. For a movie that seems to want to tell us how brutal the west was by being \"gritty and real\" there is an awful lot of \"this only happens in the movies\" at the end, especially the last episode.I wish I would have stopped after episode II and imagined the rest.The last episode is a 2/10 for me.We gotta get to your father, never mind let's go to California. We gotta reunited the Mormon husband and wife... naw let's have them accidentally attack each other and die.Vague motivations, inconsistent tone, absolutely no payoff for anything.Rant Time:Also, can we stop doing the \"young White girl on the frontier falls in love with an Indian/tribe\" thing? 1883 had the girl who was in love with a cowboy, then he dies... and a day later she is madly in love with an Indian kid and then dies and goes to Indian Heaven where he is waiting for her on a horse even though he isn't dead. This show has a \"I'm a Mormon in 1858 but I don't believe in religion and hate this marriage and love the Indians\" and the virtue signalling of \"why do your people hunger for war\" ...\"because we are afraid of what we don't understand\" BS... the American Indian tribes were insanely brutal. To one another, to their own people, and to American settlers. Yes, I'm sure there were some violent Americans that went out there running from the law or whatever it was back east and just killed and American Indians horribly.This show wants to show the brutality of the American Plains Indians... but also do the Hollywood thing of \"among these people I've felt a peace I've never felt\" and \"after a week with them I've decided to abandon 20+ years of upbringing in society and Mormonism to live among the Indians wearing skins...\"THE TIMEFRAME: we know what year this happens in... but I wish the show would've told us \"3 days later\" or something.Because you've got the scalped Pratt guy who is still covered in blood and seems to be only a few days after the attack... yet has apparently been with the Indians for weeks? She gave up resisting and is now working with them, learning from them, and feels she belongs with them?Meanwhile the husband's scalp stitches are bleeding nonstop.Just hard to keep track of anything... none of the motivations lineup or payoff. It's just a random brutal story that shows how Brutal the west was but not in a Band of Brothers realistic way. More in a \"average action flick that I will completely forget about in a month\" way.",

Worse, it seems that every cliche of Hollywood melodrama came to play on the home stretch of this otherwise great show - from the pious woman turned Shoshone warrior within a couple of hours to her husband slaying her by mistake on the battlefield, from late love and tears in the snowy forest to the stubborn owner of a fort who suddenly gives it all up for one last drink at the saloon: from ten points for the first five episodes to seven, which is my overall rating after seeing the messy end of what had started so promising.",

From the first episode, the series hooks you with its unflinching realism, emotional depth, and incredible storytelling.First, let's talk about the creative force behind it. Peter Berg, a master of gritty, character-driven narratives (Lone Survivor, Friday Night Lights, Kingdom), proves once again why he's one of the best in the business. His ability to combine breathtaking action with intimate, emotional moments is on full display here. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning, capturing the beauty and the savagery of the untamed frontier in equal measure.The cast is another standout. Taylor Kitsch gives one of the best performances of his career, fully embodying the complex and tormented spirit of his character. Betty Gilpin, Jai Courtney, Dane DeHaan, and Shea Whigham round out an incredible ensemble that brings authenticity and raw emotion to every scene. Each character feels deeply human, shaped by the brutal world they inhabit.This isn't your typical Western. It's brutal, uncompromising, and filled with tension. The writing is sharp, exploring themes of survival, morality, and the costs of progress without feeling preachy. Every episode had me on the edge of my seat, and by the time the credits rolled on the final episode, I found myself in awe of what I'd just witnessed.It's a hard watch at times, but that's what makes it so effective. If you're looking for a Western that doesn't romanticize the past but instead dives headfirst into its harsh realities, \"American Primeval\" is a must-watch. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, this series is so well-crafted that it transcends its Western roots.Netflix truly knocked it out of the park with this limited series. I binged all six episodes in one sitting and was left speechless. Don't sleep on this show-it's a masterpiece.",

In the middle of dinner there is a cheap jump scare scene where a woman has an arrow shoot through her head.Why? Because this show needs to be exceptionally violent. Is it even remotely logical or plausible? Not for a moment. Native Americans did not have modern compound bows. The maximum range was -- at best -- 100 yards, but for an arrow to fully penetrate bone you would have to be half of that distance.So, we have to suspend disbelief that in a wide open desert where you can see for miles that an attacking party could sneak up within 40 or 50 yards.It's this kind of cheap move for violence and to grab people that tells you everything you need to know about this show.It's all about excessive violence, shock and gore and there is very, very little that is accurate or realistic.",

Even during the \"Utah War.\"And they never destroyed a Shoshone village to cover their tracks of the first crime.All of these plot elements paint Latter-day Saints as a radical and zealously hostile religious group, yet all of these plot points are 100% fiction.Some of the show's characters are based on real people, such as Brigham Young, Bill Hickman, and Jim Bridger.Yet again, this is more fiction than fact, such as in the depiction of Brigham Young as a ruthless and mu****ous empire builder, which is simply not supported by the documents we have of his life.Now to be clear, there are examples in Latter-day Saint history where they were the aggressors, such as in the Mountain Meadows Mass***e, or the Black Hawk War. These are complex and horrifying events that I think deserve careful study and discussion.But the way this show exaggerates, expands, and conflates multiple, isolated events into a single plot-just to ramp up the violins-can perpetuate harmful stereotypes about the religion.",

        "content": "I watched this over the course of a snow bound day and was glad to see a western story that was very different from the \"popular\" western series of the past years. Netflix released this as a complete limited series, which is such a relief after suffering through a bunch of series done in the old Big 3 network style of an episode a week.We all know the network that released those recent series, and I do wish they would wake up to the fact that streaming did away with most of the viewers willing to put up with that game. Also, the recent western series are all done by the same guy using the same set of supporting actors, for the most part. That guy's work has worn out its welcome for me.Anyway, this fine western has no episode filler, no interminable intro, and not too much anachronistic wokeness in the story line. The anachronisms in the weaponry and costumes isn't too much to bear and doesn't become a deal-breaker.This story breaks the mold of western series, in several ways. It's storytelling that gets right to the point without all the padding that an ongoing TV series always has. We know right away when a character is a villain, without a multi-episode side story.Western fans could well end up making this a very widely watched miniseries. I doubt that its success would convince the current makers of the old pattern of dragged out series, but that old model is dying off anyway.I do hope that Netflix updates the IMDB pages for this show to give cast credits to some good actors who aren't listed, such as Irene Bedard and Jeremiah Bitsui. The cast is excellent, IMO.",

But it's a background story that concludes with the burning of a fort.The main premise is a boy and his mother need to go west to find his father, which we never get to see.It's just another example of Netflix not developing a Story or Characters that one can truly invest in or care about it.Skip and you will be okay.",

A warm homemade meal.What I got was the Tuesday cafeteria special: a scoop of leftover mashed potatoes, and it landed right in the lima beans. It's food, but I didn't love eating it.Credit where it's due, Den 2 is shot well and sounds great. Better than the first. Some nifty heist hijinks were clever.But the lazy writing, plot conveniences, flat characters, meaningless subplots, insufferable music score (near the end), and shoddy pacing sully much of the positives.The first Den displayed constant tension as the cops brushed shoulders with the crooks in everyday situations, suspicion ever present. Here, there's hardly any friction, and when it's there, it's contrived.And at the end of the day, I'd rather watch Ghost Protocol or Italian Job than a shallow, underwhelming imitation.",

In this one we have only Donnie and Nick and some generic stand ins who we don't know or get to know, so we don't care for them at all.The action scenes in part 1 were phenomenal and well shot and acted. In this one they were sloppy and felt forced. Especially at the end of the car chase, truly after an all night drive to escape and THAT'S where they meet up with what's his face.... sure, that wasn't immensely convenient...The heist itself wasn't terrible, it felt real enough with a few minor issues.A staffing of 6 or so guards for the world diamond exchange.... 2 guys to clear the whole building???? They didn't even have radios when clearing ffs.During the escape chase, the entire city of Nice is practicially empty because.... just because.Ad placement takes on a whole new level of idiocy in most newer movies, this time Porsche (Volkswagen group) and Audi were the focus.The ending also not very convincing, Nick does what he does and then just passes on this info that isn't even helpful... \"sit back left\" not a single shot fired and \"back left\" isn't actually a seat position, rear passenger or driver side is. Back left depends on your orientation.Had anyone else delivered the info though it would've made more sense.",

The original is an instant classic that no one knows about, so Pantera has a lot to live up to. It mostly delivers, with Butler and Jackson renewing their special game of chess. Supporting roles are also solid, with Evin Ahmad a sexy standout. Action is less visceral this time, but Pantera's quiet intensity makes up for it, especially during the mostly silent heist scene. The thing that keeps Pantera from joining its brother as one of the best heist/action movies of all time is its last 10 minutes. There's at least three endings here, and while I love a good twist, the ending might make you scratch your head. That won't matter to some, who have been desiring a reality palette cleanse after too many watchings of Wicked and Mufasa. Eve. With its flaws, Pantera is a perfect scratch for that itch, and it comes highly recommended.",

It's like they wrote a B-tier heist movie and were not sure about it so the studio attached the Den of Thieves IP to it in an effort to prop it up...Honestly, it has NOTHING to do with the original other than sticking Donnie and Nick in it. Think about it, you can just change their names and there is nothing to attach it to the original.I'm sorry, but Donnie isn't an international jewel thief and Big Nick isn't going to follow him to Europe. It's so dumb...The first one was fun. The crew seemed like real guys, that could probably pull of the heist. They had some military training and they came across as scary guys you might see, and avoid, at your local dive bar. This movie has the super model woman and the multi national crew, it's just lame, nobody is real.Donnie has a French accent now, and he totally pulls it off!!! Lol...Worst of all, they completely neuter Big Nick. Gerard Butler is awesome and he kills it as Big Nick in the first one. He has so much swagger. This movie, he does the best with the what he's given (he is the only reason I ponied up 2 stars instead of 1) but the script doesn't give him any cool moments to run with. Like remember his entrance in the first? Eating donuts from a blood stained box in the middle of a crime scene? It was awesome. Funny, but still gets across that he doesn't give a duck.What about in the first heist in the original? It gets across that the crew is trained, tactically sound, and has a moral code they attempt to abide by. This movie, just tries to make them look cool and flashy, no substance.I knew I was in for a disappointment when the screen told us we were in Belgium... Immediately, it was a kick in the gut, they are taking the franchise in this garbage direction... Just watch, 4 movies from now Donnie and Nick will be stealing space crystals from a mining colony on an asteroid and racing to Mars in a rocket ship that looks like a Porsche or something.They just want to make a new Fast and Furious franchise...If you are an actual fan of the original, you will hate this one, save your money.",

        "content": "Den of Thieves 2: Pantera is an entertaining sequel that captures the essence of a high-stakes heist with a Grand Theft Auto mission feel. While it doesn't surpass its predecessor, it delivers solid action and suspense, keeping you on the edge of your seat. However, a few missteps in pacing and scope prevent it from reaching its full potential.What I Liked\n1. The Heist Execution: The film's innovative, detailed approach to planning and executing the heist was highlighted, offering nail-biting tension during the climax.2. Action Sequences: The gunfights and tactical moves were not just well-executed, they were pulse-pounding, keeping the adrenaline high and the audience fully engaged.3. Character Dynamics: Gerard Butler's cop character dipping into criminal waters added an intriguing dynamic, making the story more than just a heist. From the beginning, Oshea's character growth and commitment to his skills keep you invested in the characters.What I Didn't Like\n1. Overextended Scale: The international setting felt unnecessarily grand, losing the first film's intimate, gritty charm.2. Pacing Issues: The first half dragged significantly, making the 2-hour 20-minute runtime feel bloated.3. Predictable Twist: While the ending twist added intrigue, it was telegraphed too early, diminishing its impact.Final ThoughtsIf you enjoyed the first Den of Thieves, you'll likely appreciate this sequel for its thrilling heist and action-packed moments, but temper expectations. The film trades its predecessor's smaller, sharper focus for a grander yet less cohesive narrative.Recommendation: Watch it if you're in the mood for a fun, action-heavy heist movie. It's not groundbreaking, but it's worth a trip to the theater .Rating:\n3.5/5 or 7/10 or B-: An enjoyable sequel.",

Like, it had energy, it had charm-it kept you on the edge of your seat. This? Nah. The heist isn't even doing what a good heist should do. You know how Ocean's 11 had you thinking, \"How are they gonna pull this off?\" or how Money Heist had that crazy tension where you were rooting for them even when things went sideways? This movie isn't giving me any of that. It's like they tried, but it just feels hollow.Honestly, I'd rather sit through Fast and Furious 20 at this point.

It felt like the plot was dragging on with unnecessary scenes that didn't contribute much to the overall story. The dialogue was lackluster, and the characters felt underdeveloped, making it hard to connect with them or care about their journeys.Things only started to get interesting during the diamond heist, which happens almost two hours into the film. By that point, I was already losing hope that the movie would pick up. The heist itself was well-executed and provided a brief moment of excitement, but it came far too late to redeem the rest of the film. It's frustrating that the only real action was crammed into the final portion of the movie, leaving the majority of the runtime feeling dull and unengaging.The ending, in my opinion, was underwhelming and left a lot to be desired. It felt rushed and didn't provide a satisfying conclusion to the buildup from the heist. I walked away feeling disappointed and like I had wasted my time.Overall, I wouldn't recommend spending money to see this movie in theaters. It's not worth the ticket price or the time investment. If you're curious, wait until it's available to watch at home. At least then, you'll have the option to pause or skip through the slower parts.",

There was not nearly enough pressure put on the two leads. It had a great hook at the beginning, but then it dragged on trying to build character or story or ... so there it is, it just tried and never succeeded at being special. There is one scene where the film focuses on backstory and character. Just one, all jammed into one. It's noticeable.Acting ~ 6 ⭐\nGerard is a long way off from Sparta here. His performance wasn't moving; it lacked emotion and nuance. The 2nd lead, O'Shea Jackson Jr., well how can I put this nicely ... was not as good as Gerard. There was no chemistry between the leads. It just was not there. They tried to add a romance sub-plot but that failed too. Enough said.Cinematography ~ 8 ⭐\nThe cinematography was saved by the sweeping drone shots and the chase scene. It was good but not great. I think I'm being generous here. The landscape where this film was shot is breathtaking. They were smart to spend a lot of money on drone work. It's a pretty film, but nothing spectacular.Some Commentary\nI was excited to see this movie, mainly because of the trailer-it's got a killer trailer. While in the theater, I kept hope, saying to myself, okay now it is going to ramp up and change for the better, but it plateaued and never did. The gravy never thickened.There's a formula in Hollywood that big studios use. It goes something like (Name Actors + cool stunts + marketing = box office). There are of course numbers and multiples attached to this equation. This movie felt like it was plugged into the equation and shown to be profitable, then green-lit.My Advice\nWait and see it on Prime Video. It's still fun, but not theater fun. Or, go watch it and let me know in the comments if you agree or disagree. Until next time.",

We don't know why Nice Cube is doing what he's doing - because reasons - and the supporting cast of villains are utterly forgettable east European swarthy heavies. You honestly struggle to remember who is who and you care even less. This is especially egregious given how well drawn the characters in the first film were. Everybody looks bored and confused here. Like the audience.There are some unforgivable macguffins - people appearing out of nowhere to save the day who couldn't possibly have known where the characters were going to be at that point in the film because they just crashed after a long car chase in the middle of nowhere. I can't believe we waited seven years for this. It's a forgettable, muddled B movie at best and considering it's the same talent behind the film as the first one that's really a massively wasted opportunity.

A good selection of actors who are clearly international, which today's crime is. A simple scenario, with a realistic approach to awarding the prize, without a super computer and flying over Mars and Neptune to the center of the earth. Simply simple real.

Butler also makes some odd choices in this movie. He's doing less of a Gerry Butler thing and more of a Fatman from Jake and the Fatman. Slurping and snorting and smacking his lips throughout the entire movie. He even makes smoking cigarette sound like a glutton who is bathing in a tub full of leftover and slimey spaghetti. Butler plays the American Idiot in Europe to a one. Ostentatiously miss pronouncing croissant like only a fake American could.And then there is poor O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube Jr). Cube2 is supposed to playing an American gangster who is supposed to be posing as an African/French diamond smuggler, he clearly doesn't speak a word of French and his Pan-Mediterranean/Pan-North African accent comes and goes like a fart in a car.At the end of the day the action scenes pay off, so there's that.

So they tack on an extra ending where Big Nick helps Donnie escape. But at that point all I could think was, who cares!?!? The damage has already been done.

        "title": "Chhava (2025) - A Missed Opportunity to Honor History",
        "content": "I had high expectations for Chhava, but unfortunately, the film falls short in multiple ways.The narrative feels unbalanced, beginning and ending with Aurangzeb's perspective. The film highlights war scenes but lacks clarity on the purpose and stakes of these battles. Key historical events such as the Battle of Ramsej, the Heist of Burhanpur, the Battle of Goa, naval conflicts, and the aftermath of the execution at Tulapur are entirely missing. These crucial elements could have elevated the film to legendary status.Lack of Character DepthMany key figures remain underdeveloped, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them. Important warriors such as Santaji, Dhanaji and Hambirrao are either sidelined or not given their due recognition. This affects the emotional weight of the film, particularly in moments of sacrifice and valor.Historical Inaccuracies in the ClimaxThe depiction of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's capture and execution deviates significantly from historical records. In reality, his imprisonment was kept secret for over a month, yet in the film, the news spreads immediately, leading to a misleading portrayal of the Marathas' response.Additionally, the setting of his torture scene is historically inaccurate. Instead of being confined in secrecy, as recorded, the film depicts him tied under the open sun, which misrepresents the true events.Missed Cultural and Religious NuancesThe film repeatedly shows Aurangzeb's prayers being fulfilled while the prayers of Yesubai and other Marathas go unanswered. This narrative choice may come across as an unintentional imbalance, potentially altering the perception of historical events.Incomplete StorytellingThe bond between Kavi Kalash and Sambhaji Maharaj, an essential part of history, is underplayed. A powerful moment, where Kavi Kalash recited poetry highlighting Sambhaji Maharaj's unwavering spirit even in captivity, is omitted.Additionally, the aftermath of Sambhaji Maharaj's execution-which led to a fierce Maratha resurgence-deserved more emphasis. The contributions of legendary warriors like Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav, who later became instrumental in resisting Aurangzeb, are completely ignored.Unnecessary AdditionsThe inclusion of Aurangzeb's daughter feels out of place, as there is no significant historical evidence of her direct involvement in these events.Final VerdictDespite its grand scale and production value, Chhava misses the opportunity to properly showcase the bravery and sacrifice of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and his warriors. The film lacks historical accuracy, underdevelops key figures, and leaves out essential moments that could have made it a truly unforgettable epic.",

        "content": "Laxman Utekar's Chhaava focuses on the Battle of Burhanpur and its impact on the Maratha-Mughal war, rather than being a complete biopic of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. The first half of the film struggles with pacing, but the second half gains momentum, leading to an intense and emotionally charged climax. The confrontation between Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb, particularly the exchange between Vicky Kaushal and Vineet Kumar, stands out as one of the film's most powerful moments. The battle sequences are well-executed, but the background score by A. R. Rahman lacks the necessary intensity to match the spirit of the Marathas. The action scenes are largely effective, though some exaggerated stunts and editing choices take away from the realism. Despite this, the film excels in its cinematography, costume design, and CGI, successfully recreating the historical setting.The performances elevate the film. Vicky Kaushal delivers a commanding portrayal of Sambhaji Maharaj, capturing his strength, determination, and sacrifice, especially in the final moments. Akshaye Khanna leaves a strong impact as Aurangzeb, despite limited dialogue, while Rashmika Mandanna, though competent, feels miscast. Ashutosh Rana provides solid support, and Vineet Kumar stands out with his gripping screen presence.

The film's narrative, set against the backdrop of Apshinge Military Village in Maharashtra, offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of families bound by centuries of military service, from the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to today. Vicky Kaushal's performance as Sambhaji Maharaj is both powerful and nuanced, capturing the essence of a leader torn between duty and personal sacrifice. Akshaye Khanna's portrayal of Aurangzeb is equally compelling, bringing depth to the antagonist's role. The supporting cast, including Rashmika Mandanna, Ashutosh Rana, and Divya Dutta, deliver stellar performances that enrich the narrative. The film's direction by Laxman Utekar is commendable, seamlessly blending historical events with personal stories. A. R.

It doesn't just focus on the king himself but also highlights the warriors who fought alongside him, the advisors who guided him, the people who believed in him, and even those who betrayed him. The depth given to the supporting characters makes the film richer, as it shows how every decision made by the king had a ripple effect on countless lives. The film acknowledges that history is not just about kings and rulers; it is about the people who shape it. The portrayal of his allies, as well as his adversaries, adds layers to the narrative, making it clear that the battle for the Maratha Empire was fought on many fronts-physically, politically, and emotionally.",

Plus it'd have been better if the director had casted someone else instead of Rashmika. She's just awful. She can't act. She shouldn't be in bollywood or maybe she shouldn't do roles that require ACTING cause she can't act.",

The film definitely suffers from screenplay issues in its first half. It's the second half where the film picks up. The pre-climax battle and the violent yet emotional climax stand out, especially a particular scene starring Vicky and Vineet, and the to & fro between the kings.However, the music and score by A. R. Rahman felt like the weakest part of the film. It worked in parts but It didn't have the necessary energy to match the Maratha spirit in battle scenes, and in many places, the score was so out of sync that it distracted from the screen. Apart from Vicky Kaushal flying, the action is raw and good, but the editing makes it look awkward on-screen. The camerawork, coloring, and costume department deserve special mention. At the same time, the wide-location CGI work is subpar.It is actually the performances that make the film what it is. Vicky Kaushal roars as Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj.The climax sequence is particularly very well executed by Vicky. Akshaye Khanna does less talking but shines as Aurangzeb. Rashmika was good but felt miscast. Ashutosh Rana provides good support. Divya Dutta and Diana Penty have limited roles to offer. But the man who stands out in the supporting cast is Vineet Kumar, whose crucial dialogue delivery stays with you throughout. The rest of the supporting cast also does a good job. Overall, Chhaava is not something extraordinary and has its fair share of flaws, but it's the performances that make it a must-watch. The last 30-40 mins will definitely make you emotional and leave the theatre silent.OVERALL - 3.25/5.",

        "content": "I walked into Chhaava expecting a gripping historical drama, but what I got instead was a test of patience. This movie stretches every scene unnecessarily, dragging out moments that should have been quick and impactful. A simple 10-second shot is extended to 20 seconds, just for the sake of unnecessary cinematic angles that serve no purpose. Instead of immersing us in the story, the director seems more focused on slow-motion shots and dramatic pauses that kill the pacing.Now, let's talk about the absolute absurdity of the lion fight scene. Does the director even know what a lion looks like? Because the size proportions in this movie suggest otherwise. The protagonist's hand was somehow as big as the lion's jaw! It completely ruined the intensity of the scene-how are we supposed to take it seriously when the CGI makes it look like he's fighting an oversized dog?And then there's the issue of irrelevant side characters and pointless subplots. Rather than keeping the film focused, the story drags with unnecessary diversions that add nothing but confusion. It's as if they were trying to pad the runtime without any thought to storytelling.The final nail in the coffin? The complete lack of battle tactics. The fights are nothing but over-the-top, one-sided action sequences where the good guys dominate without a scratch. Where's the strategy? Where's the realism? Battles in history weren't won by just swinging swords blindly, but this movie makes it seem like they were. It's lazy filmmaking at best.I honestly don't understand how directors come up with this kind of nonsense. Do they not even attempt to stay connected to reality? Do they just assume the audience will accept anything as long as it looks \"grand\" on screen? Chhaava could have been a compelling historical epic, but instead, it's a frustrating mess of stretched-out scenes, bad CGI, unnecessary subplots, and unrealistic battles. An absolute disappointment.",

A film of this magnitude needed a visionary approach, but the storytelling feels rushed and lacks emotional depth. Key historical moments that should have been grand and impactful end up feeling underwhelming due to poor pacing and weak scene transitions.Another major flaw is the cinematography and overall production quality. For a film that showcases one of the most powerful warrior kings in Indian history, the visuals fail to capture the grandeur and intensity of the era. The battle sequences lack realism, and the film's color grading and VFX work feel outdated and inconsistent.

        "title": "Positive reviews are fake",
        "content": "Movie Review: ChaavvaChaavva is a perfect example of how action alone cannot carry a film. From start to finish, the movie is an incoherent mess, filled with repetitive fight sequences, weak storytelling, and poorly developed characters. The director clearly wanted to create a high-energy, action-packed film, but what we get instead is a frustrating and mindless spectacle that lacks substance, emotion, and engagement.Lack of Storytelling and Character DevelopmentOne of the biggest flaws of Chaavva is its complete disregard for storytelling. The movie jumps from one action scene to another without any real effort to build a narrative. There is no proper setup, no depth to the characters, and no emotional stakes that make the audience care. Instead of crafting a gripping story, the film simply throws us into random fights, expecting the action alone to hold our attention.Character development is nonexistent. The protagonist is nothing more than a one-dimensional figure who exists solely to fight. We never get to understand his motivations, background, or internal struggles. The supporting characters suffer even more, with barely any screen time or significance beyond being used as plot devices. The result is a movie where the audience feels completely disconnected from the characters, making it impossible to invest in what happens to them.Mindless Action Without ImpactAction sequences should serve a purpose, whether it's to drive the story forward, reveal character traits, or build tension. Unfortunately, Chaavva treats action as the only thing that matters, leading to a repetitive and tiresome experience. Instead of well-choreographed fights that feel earned, the film bombards the audience with over-the-top sequences that have no weight or impact. There is no suspense, no stakes-just endless brawls that quickly become exhausting rather than exciting.The problem isn't just the quantity of fight scenes but also their lack of originality. It's clear that the director attempted to mimic the high-energy action style of South Indian cinema, but the execution falls flat. Where South Indian films masterfully balance action with gripping storytelling, strong emotions, and memorable characters, Chaavva fails in every one of these areas. The action feels forced and disconnected, making it a poor imitation rather than a worthy tribute.Wasted Talent and Poor DirectionOne of the most disappointing aspects of Chaavva is the complete waste of talented actors. The film features a cast with proven skills, yet none of them are given anything meaningful to work with. It's frustrating to see good actors stuck in a film that does not utilize their abilities. Instead of giving them well-written roles, the director reduces them to mere placeholders in a chaotic mess of a movie.The director's lack of vision is evident throughout the film. There is no sense of pacing, no emotional depth, and no creative storytelling choices. Every scene feels rushed and thoughtless, as if the film was made just for the sake of having something on screen. A good director knows how to balance action with engaging storytelling, but Chaavva fails in every possible way.Final Verdict: Don't Waste Your TimeChaavva is a film that is best avoided. It lacks any redeeming qualities, offering nothing beyond mindless and repetitive action. The story is weak, the characters are shallow, and the direction is uninspired. If you're looking for a well-made action film, there are plenty of better options out there. Don't waste your time or money on this disaster.Rating: 1/10.",

What makes these sequences even more impressive is how they highlight not just brute strength but also military intelligence and strategy. Sambhaji Maharaj was not just a warrior; he was a master tactician who understood the nuances of warfare, and the film does an incredible job of showcasing this. The camera work, the use of slow-motion in key moments, and the sound design all contribute to creating battles that are not just visually stunning but also emotionally charged.",

        "title": "\"DEVA\" - When Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (and Script)",
        "content": "\"DEVA,\" a film that answers the age-old question: \"What if we remade 'Mumbai Police' but with 73% more cigarette smoke?\"Let me paint you a picture - or rather, let me try to see the picture through the perpetual fog of tobacco haze that the director seems to mistake for atmospheric cinematography. Shahid Kapoor plays Dev - or at least I think it's Shahid Kapoor. It's honestly hard to tell, given that he spends most of the movie doing his best impression of a smoke machine at a 90s rock concert.The plot, when visible through the nicotine clouds, follows Mumbai cops investigating an officer's murder. Simple enough, right? Not for DEVA. This movie takes that premise and dices it into so many jump cuts, it's like watching a jigsaw puzzle solve itself backwards. They're playing detective with their own plot, and spoiler alert: even they can't crack the case.Now, let's talk about our lead. Shahid Kapoor apparently misread \"method acting\" as \"chain-smoking method.\" His tough-guy interpretation lands somewhere between a noir detective who forgot his personality at the dry cleaners and a vape shop mannequin who just discovered existentialism. The man has two expressions throughout the film: brooding and... slightly more brooding with extra smoke. It's like watching someone who studied police work exclusively through Instagram noir filters.And because one stoic smokestack wasn't enough, the film gives us TWO versions of Dev - literally smoke and mirrors, as a convenient flashback shows us through an actual mirror. One inhales with angst, the other exhales with slightly more angst. It's the kind of character development you can measure in nicotine patches.Pooja Hegde appears as a journalist investigating police brutality, though her role seems to mainly consist of showing up occasionally to remind us that women exist in this universe. Her character has all the depth of a parking ticket.The cinematography deserves special mention. The film's colour grading looks like they discovered the \"desaturate\" button in editing software and thought, \"This is it. This is cinema.\" It's trying so hard to look gritty that it ends up looking like an Instagram story from 2015.You know you're in trouble when the most emotional relationship in your film is between the protagonist and his lighter.And the twist ending... oh, the twist ending. It arrives with all the subtlety of a marching band in a library. By the time we get to the obligatory prison fights and heroic rescues, you'll be wishing you had spent your money on literally anything else - like, say, rewatching \"Don\" at home with a tub of popcorn.In the end, \"DEVA\" is what happens when you mistake style for substance, cigarette smoke for character development, and confusion for complexity. Sometimes the best special effects are good acting and a coherent script. It's a remake that not only misses the point of the original but manages to create several new, arguably worse points of its own.Rating: Two smoke rings out of five.",

        "title": "A Poor Retelling of a Deva-stating & Derogatory Thriller",
        "content": "Deva (2025) :\nMovie Review -With Deva, Rosshan Andrrews presents a Hindi adaptation of his Malayalam thriller, Mumbai Police. Instead of a gay character, the main protagonist here is a womanizer and a corrupt officer, and that is the only change you will notice. The second change is the addition of Pooja Hegde, aka Heroine's role, which is quite predictable since the hero is not portrayed as a gay character. However, the film suffers more from its dated storytelling than these anticipated flaws. The narrative appears confused about whether to become a mass film or a neat thriller, and in that struggle, the main essence of Deva is completely lost.Based on Mumbai Police (2013), Deva tells the story of an unstable police officer, Deva Ambre (Shahid Kapoor), who is honest, aggressive, and has anger issues. While he is confrontational with every criminal and politician, he is infatuated with a news reporter, Diya (Pooja Hegde). Deva shares a strong friendship with two of his colleagues, almost like a brotherhood. One of them, Rohan (Pavail Gulati), is shot dead on the day he is to receive a gallantry award, and Deva is assigned the task of finding the killer. Deva discovers the killer, but in the next moment, he has an accident. He loses his memory, and his senior officer gives him another chance to find the killer since he has done it before. Will Deva be able to find the killer with little of his past to recall?Since it's been about 13 years, I assume many of you have seen Mumbai Police, so I'll directly get to the point instead of avoiding spoilers. The Malayalam thriller is, by many means, derogatory to the uniform and the main character, who is supposed to earn some respect. In this film, that sexual identity element is removed-thank god-but what's left for the twist then? The configuration of Deva first goes wrong on paper; forget the on-screen material, which is too abrupt and clueless. We have a wild entry for the hero, and while I liked it, how many times do you need that background score, slow-motion walks, and movements to elevate the scene? It becomes tedious right after the first scene. By the time the twist is revealed, you have no patience left to stay and view it. I saw a couple of people getting up and exiting the auditorium even before the full twist was explained. The screenplay is that lengthy and boring. The love story between Shahid and Pooja's characters never started actually, but still you have to put a kissing scene between them and make it look forced.The performance of Shahid Kapoor is decent, but I expect much better from him. The teaser was cut in such a manner that it was supposed to give us an idea of a mass hero, but in the film, it loses that value due to repetitiveness. Kapoor hasn't put in much effort and does remind you of his wild characterization from \"Kabir Singh\" with that arrogant talk and smoking scenes, but beyond that, I didn't find anything good. Pooja Hegde disappoints once again, and I'd really like to see her in character-driven roles in the future. Even a mainstream heroine is okay, but she should have some screen presence and substance that people can remember for at least a while. Pavail Gulati was a perfect fit, Pravesh Rana was okay, Girish Kulkarni was pretty good, while Kubbra Sait and Aditi Sharma passed the time without much effort. The rest of the supporting cast was hardly notable.The biggest fault in \"Deva\" is its technical aspects. The action scenes are poorly designed, and the sound design for the same is terrible. You just can't feel the intensity of those action scenes. Deva is beating the goons brutally, but that brutality is hardly visible to the eyes and ears. The editing also brings the film further down. Two hours and 36 minutes-God, why didn't it end half an hour ago? The Deva rap doesn't help much, and \"Bhasad Macha\" has zero impact. Roshan Andrrews could have skipped the idea of remaking \"Mumbai Police,\" which I personally believe couldn't be successful at the box office. But still, they tried and failed. The box office numbers for this film will only encourage the movement to \"Save Bollywood from remakes\" and are likely to provide another lesson for Shahid Kapoor after \"Jersey.\" Bro, you can't get \"Kabir Singh\" every time.RATING - 4/10*",

His body language and rowdiness are well-balanced by his ability to portray deep emotions. Pavail Gulati gives a commendable performance, while Pravesh Rana provide good support, along with Girish Kulkarni and Upendra Limaye. Although Pooja Hegde does an okay job but her character doesn't have much to do in the film. Deva also suffers from few loose ends and felt that it doesn't answer certain plot points. Overall, despite an average screenplay, good direction, and an amazing Shahid Kapoor, Deva results in a decent thriller.OVERALL -6/10.",

        "content": "Wached the movie and u can't ignore but notice from the very first scene that Shahid Kapoor in every scene is trying to impress with his screen presence. Irritating after a point. The screenplay was jumping all over the place in a non-linear confusing way. Yet, director was able to hold it together somehow as the story is interesting. Unlike most hindi movies, it had a story, making one curious, what is in store, what will be the twist. And behold, it had a twist that is very interesting and u admire it for originality. But wait, bollywood movie and originality? So you start wondering is it a lift-off from a Korean movie ! So you search in google and there it is. Original is a Malayalam movie. Even the director is the same.Now you have to watch the original as the Bollywood version is left with a promise, lot of missed opportunities to make a good movie, kind of spoiling a good story and made into a \"hero\" Shahid movie. And behold, the original has a great screenplay, wonderful acting by prithviraj and u watch it like a all new gripping movie.So when you watch the original, all you feel is pity for Bollywood. Just that it is bollywood and its hero culture, style without substance (similar to many telegu movies) formula, overall lack of talent in the mainstream that a good story like this from a malayalam movie by the same director is spoiled into a mediocre one.Morale of Deva, you give a good movie to bollywood and they will ensure it is made it in to an average one. Drishyam may be the only two movies made reasonably well by copying scene to scene. That's the only way.",

        "title": "Breaking the Norm: Why This Animation is a Must - Watch?",
        "content": "A Masterpiece of Visual Storytelling: Where Artistic Ambition Meets Pulse-Pounding SpectacleIn the ever-evolving landscape of animated cinema emerges a groundbreaking work that redefines the boundaries of visual narrative - a tour de force that orchestrates a perfect symphony of artistic sensibility and crowd-pleasing entertainment. This animated marvel transcends conventional categorization, presenting audiences with an immersive sensory experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Through its bold fusion of painterly aesthetics and kinetic energy, the film establishes itself as a new benchmark for contemporary animation.The Anatomy of Perfection: Martial Choreography as Cinematic PoetryThe film's combat sequences amount to nothing short of a revelation in motion picture craftsmanship. Each frame throbs with meticulously calculated violence that transcends ordinary action - it's balletic brutality elevated to high art. The animators demonstrate masterful command of temporal manipulation, using judicious slow - motion effects not as gimmicks but as narrative punctuation marks. These deliberate pauses in the chaos serve dual purposes: allowing viewers to appreciate the exquisite detail in every muscle contraction and weapon trajectory while amplifying the visceral impact through dramatic tension - building.When the action accelerates to real - time velocity, the screen erupts in a fireworks display of particle effects and environmental destruction that would make Michael Bay reconsider his career choices. The technical wizardry on display draws favorable comparisons to the renowned Western animated series RWBY. With its unique camera language and precise grasp of action rhythm, this work stands out among numerous animations, creating a distinctive style of its own.Humanity in the Midst of Mayhem: A Tapestry of BrotherhoodBeneath the surface pyrotechnics lies the film's beating heart - an emotionally resonant exploration of male camaraderie that avoids sentimental tropes. The ensemble cast functions as a complex ecosystem of conflicting loyalties and shared burdens. Through subtle facial animations and body language that could rival live-action method acting, the characters reveal layered personalities that evolve organically across the narrative arc.Particularly noteworthy is the nuanced portrayal of fraternal bonds under stress - the unspoken understandings conveyed through shared glances during battle preparations, the protective instincts that override self-preservation, and the quiet moments of vulnerability hidden beneath martial bravado. These relationships attain Shakespearean depth through carefully crafted dialogue that balances poetic introspection with vernacular authenticity.Narrative Precision: The Virtue of Restraint in StorycraftIn an era plagued by narrative excess and manufactured drama, this film stands as a testament to the power of disciplined storytelling. The plot unfolds with the elegant efficiency of a Swiss timepiece, each story beat serving multiple purposes - advancing character development while maintaining relentless forward momentum. Unlike lesser productions that rely on contrived conflicts, the tension here arises naturally from established personalities clashing with environmental pressures.The screenplay demonstrates remarkable respect for audience intelligence, trusting viewers to follow complex political machinations without expositional hand-holding. Character decisions remain consistently logical within established parameters, creating a domino effect of cause-and-consequence that heightens dramatic stakes. Even minor supporting roles receive thoughtful motivation arcs, contributing to the rich tapestry of this fully realized world.Conclusion: A New High Water Mark for Animated StorytellingThis cinematic achievement represents more than mere entertainment - it's a paradigm shift in how animation can engage both heart and intellect. By harmonizing state-of-the-art visual innovation with timeless human drama, the creators have crafted a work that will undoubtedly influence the next generation of animators. It satisfies on every conceivable level: as a technical showpiece pushing the medium's boundaries, as a gripping character study, and most importantly, as pure cinematic exhilaration. For connoisseurs of animation and casual viewers alike, this film doesn't just raise the bar - it redesigns the entire stadium.",

        "title": "Wonderful but only a step away from perfect",
        "content": "This movie presents a complex theme, exploring the contrast between appearances and true nature. Unlike the previous film, which had a simpler message, this one challenges the idea of good and bad. It suggests that so-called good people, despite their virtuous image, may harbor dark intentions, while those labeled as bad, often judged by their outward appearance or reputation, may possess genuine kindness.Bad characters in this story are not simply misunderstood-they might be dangerous, capable of harming others, even causing deaths. Yet, the film shows that their actions do not always define their hearts. On the other hand, the so-called good people, with their pristine, noble appearances, may in fact be hiding selfishness, cruelty, or a lust for power.The turning point of the story comes when those labeled as \"bad\" extend a helping hand, ultimately playing a crucial role in defeating the supposed \"good\" figures, who are, in reality, corrupt. In a powerful moment of sacrifice, the \"bad\" characters willingly give up their own lives to ensure the success of a greater cause. This selfless act reshapes the audience's understanding of morality, revealing that goodness is not about appearance or status, but about one's actions and choices.Another important theme in the film is motherly love. The movie uses flashbacks-some taken directly from the previous film-to highlight the deep, unspoken bond between parents and children. A mother's love is ever-present, even when unacknowledged by the child. The story emphasizes that no parent wishes harm upon their child, reinforcing the idea that love, even when unseen, profoundly shapes a person's journey. The protagonist experiences a shift in spirit, ultimately drawing strength from this realization to confront and defeat the so-called \"good\" figures who are, in reality, the true villains.Visually, the film uses color and setting to reinforce its themes. The grand palace, built from jade-like stone, is decorated in white and green, mirroring the outward purity of those who are perceived as \"good.\" However, this purity is merely a façade-it is not the palace itself that embodies virtue, but rather the people living within it who uphold their own idea of righteousness. In contrast, the underground palace, is depicted with stone and rock, symbolizing a world hidden beneath the surface, rough and unpolished but perhaps more honest in its nature.Ultimately, it questions whether the younger generation will fearlessly change the world with their young spirit. It challenges viewers to rethink morality-not as something dictated by appearance or authority, but as something revealed through action and sacrifice.In the end, I say it's wonderful but only a step away from perfect because if he had twenty more minutes or so, I think there would be a clearer description of the complex topics. And if some parts at the beginning, which involve humor, were removed and that time was used at the end instead, I think it could become a movie that challenges the Chinese film industry.",

However despite the colorful animation and good character designs, Ne Zha 2 is basically what I dislike about modern animated movies from the whole world.Sure, it's gorgeous animation and ambitious atmosphere is great which I do like. Especially some of the action sequences and presentations are pretty well structured and filmed. However, by simply placing a convoluted plot with many themes together that don't always work, having many characters that aren't interesting, and interlacing with modern humor that is cringeworthy doesn't make the experience worth remembering.It suffers from trying to charm many elements together in one as if the writers tried to smash many ideas into one. Alongside with characters that aren't that emotionally engaging and some coming off a bit unbearable, tone being all over the place, and despite it being non-serious, the non-serious approach and comedic aspects feels forced and doesn't really add up well.Ne Zha 2 is pretty much like illumination Entertainment but from China.

While the sequel delivers a complete cinematic experience, watching Ne Zha 1 first will deepen your understanding of the character development and mythological context, ultimately enhancing your viewing journey.",

But Ne Zha 2 is absolutely legendary-nonstop excitement from start to finish, and I didn't even notice the two-plus hours passing.Since I work as a long-haul driver, and IMAX screenings were extremely limited in the U. S. (only available for one day on 1/12), I pre-booked my ticket online on the 11th. Then, I drove 20 hours from Los Angeles just to catch the IMAX version in Dallas. It was totally worth the effort-both critically acclaimed and a box office success for a reason!The entire audience was captivated for the full 2.5 hours, and no one left until the post-credits scene ended. Most people stayed until the lights came back on.Even though it's an animated film, it appeals to all ages. I'm 40 year old, and I loved every second of it!I recommend watching it in 2D or Laser 3D.",

Instead, his heroism is built on the sacrifices of the people of the Qiantang River and his mother. It even relies on actions like stepping on a woman's skirt, belittling and weakening female characters, and using small, powerless figures like the marmot to evoke sympathy. Is this really what a hero should be?In this show, all the supporting characters exist solely to highlight the protagonist's aura. Nezha comes from the lower class, and his defiance against authority is understandable, but his rise to power doesn't feel particularly moving. Characters like the marmot, Lady Shiji, and his mother are all designed to serve his success. These supporting roles could have been vibrant and compelling, yet they are instead portrayed as foolish or weak. And does the plot really need something as trivial as stepping on a woman's skirt to progress? Is this what a hero's rise should rely on?Nezha's character has been portrayed as impolite, which doesn't seem to provide a positive influence on children. Compassion and kindness should be properly guided in young minds, as this is beneficial to society.",

Nezha comes across as authentic, yet funny, and prone to angry outbursts, yet cute and caring. He makes for a great main protagonist, especially in a kids/family movie.A number of support characters, both heroes and villains, are developed well enough (given that so much run time is dedicated to action rather than - see negatives below). And some of the comic relief characters are fun.When driven by and used to support the story, the special effects are often beautiful.The story is clever. The plot is a little more complex than it seems it first; the ending is satisfying; and there's a decent moral to the story. (Maybe even a bit risky in the current political climate in China, depending on how it's interpreted.)Negatives\nNone of the above is exceptional in any way. The characters and plot are well done, but not amazing. The comedy is good, but limited in amount, and very typical for a kids movie. It certainly doesn't have anything really unique the way movies like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, or The Banquet do. Nor does it have the non-stop laughs and of movies like The Great Bicycle Race, Shaolin Soccer, or Detective Chinatown. Nothing very special, plus a major, major flaw...Only about half the movie has the positives, because the rest of the movie is an almost endless, drawn out, over-the-top fight scene - a final battle that goes on and on and on.It feels like at some point the story-teller lost influence with the director, and the animation team took over, jamming in as many effects as they could. Smaller moments throughout the movie are also examples of this. It often starts with just the right animation to show something magical happening. But then doesn't stop until another one, or two, or multiple, effects are unnecessarily thrown into the mix. The tiring end battle is where it really takes over, though and it's hard to express just how overdone it is. It really does detract from what seems a solid family cartoon at its core.With so much of the movie being that non-stop, violent, CGI-heavy final battle, it also seems unclear who the movie is for. There's too much of that for a fun family flick, yet that's clearly what the core story was *meant* to be.",

For instance, the transition between the lighthearted comedic tone dominating the first half and the heavy emotional atmosphere of the latter half feels unnatural, resulting in an incoherent growth arc for Nezha. His core transformation relies more on external plot devices rather than internal self-reflection or accumulated experiences. The protagonist's coming-of-age process lacks a \"spiritual baptism\" - pivotal moments like the battle against three demons were dismissed as \"game-like\" sequences that failed to deepen the character's inner conflicts.While attempting to expand its worldview and introduce more characters, the film's character development remains superficial in parts. Though portrayed as a military general, Yin Furen defining moments still revolve around maternal sacrifices, while female characters like Shiji Niangniang are reduced to stereotypical labels like \"appearance-obsessed overweight women.\" The overarching narrative remains centered on male-centric father-son relationships, with female characters lacking independence and depth.The film continues its predecessor's reliance on crude \"toilet humor\" gags. In emotional expression, its exploration of familial bonds and self-identity has been described as \"superficial,\" particularly in failing to fully develop the complex relationship between Nezha and Ao Bing.",

When I saw Crana told Nexha to find the restroom himself, I immediately know he's gonna pee into something ppl will eat/drink. When I saw Nezha had to use sleeping pill to drug himself for Aubing to take over, I knew Nezha was gonna wake up during a battle and cause a bunch of inconvenience, and of course he will come out fine. It just feels so predictable I don't feel any suspense or anticipation.Additionally, the characters generally don't have any arc, or any show of emotion other than their stereotypical emotion. The mom is prob my fav for showing relatable emotions. Both dads were just showing their love for their kids like it's a task, the emotion only shows up when it's their turn to move the plot. Aubing's dad and the whole race was almost killed by Nezha, but he showed no anger towards Nezha at all. Shen gong bao saw his little brother, who prob walked a long way to find him, and he sends his brother back in a matter of 5 minutes. But somehow he loves his little brother and family so much he'd give up his life to revenge. All these just don't add up for me.",

        "title": "So awesome! Surprisingly it only took five years?",
        "content": "The excellence of the previous film 'Ne Zha: The Birth of the Demon Child' has already filled my expectations. I didn't expect this sequel to live up to expectations. Not only did it achieve comprehensive upgrades in visual effects and character development, but it also brought new shock and emotion to the audience in the deep exploration of the plot and theme, once again proving the unlimited potential of domestic animation. After reading it, it still exceeded expectations by too much! It's a complete blow to the dimensionality reduction of certain Chinese comics! Let's talk about the only drawback first, the initial humor was a bit vulgar. However, the flaws do not overshadow the virtues, as everything else is almost perfect.The visual effect is really stunning! It can be called a masterpiece! The movements are smooth and natural, and every detail is handled very well, as if you are in a real battlefield. The visuals are even more stunning, whether it's the magnificent underwater world or the ethereal Jade Void Palace. The special effects visuals are not only gorgeous, but also very realistic. The scene of thousands of troops fighting in the air pushes the visual effect to the extreme, and the majestic atmosphere is no less than that of Hollywood blockbusters. In addition, the texture of water in the special effects is the most precise and complex, and the shots of seawater are numerous and beautiful, delicate and natural. There are even close-up shots of water patterns and mist, including the effects of seawater washing different materials and the subtle differences in the traces left behind, all of which are presented.The character images in the film are more full and three-dimensional compared to the first one, with each character having their own story and motivation, no longer a simple binary opposition of good and evil. Each character has distinct changes in personality. Increased the radiance and power of humanity.The movie continues the passionate and fantastical style of its predecessor in terms of plot, but also boldly innovates and reconstructs on the basis of traditional mythology. The worldview of the film is more complete, the boundaries between humans, demons, monsters, and immortals are clearer, and there are both contradictions and blends between different races. The plot has multiple echoes with the first part, but it is not just a simple echo, but a sublimation based on the first part.In terms of theme, the film continues the core proposition of \"breaking prejudices\" and expands to more complex social contradictions. The setting of the dragon clan being oppressed by the heavenly court due to their demon identity implies racial discrimination and class solidification in reality; Shen Gongbao's \"rebellion\" motivation has been further explored, highlighting the alienation of individuals by institutional biases. Even the dollar sign on the furnace satirizes some things. In addition, Nezha's transition from \"defying the heavens and changing his destiny\" to \"protecting the people\" explores the balance between individual heroism and collective interests.The music and soundtrack of the film are equally impressive, adding a lot of color to the film. The perfect integration of music and soundtrack with the visuals and plot of the film not only adds more artistic charm to the film, but also better enhances the atmosphere of the film.Overall, this is an excellent film that combines visuals, storytelling, and content. It not only showcases the strong power of Chinese animation after its rise, but also demonstrates the infinite possibilities of traditional Chinese mythology in the modern context.",

I've seen many official production videos. In the initial battle scene, with so many chains appearing simultaneously, it's difficult to make them move flexibly and naturally without any issues of model - penetration. As for the piercing of the heart - piercing curse and the skin that was torn when Nezha was stabbed, since I watched it on an IMAX screen, those details were magnified, and they were incredibly realistic. When Nezha was stabbed, the tear of the skin was clearly visible, with no flaws at all. It's really flawless, and the details are handled perfectly. I truly admire the production team.Some of the funny lines in the film bear the imprint of those from the first film, and it has surprised people like me who love to review. Although it is not tiring to hear, every time you hear it can still make people laugh, but it is undeniable that sometimes it will produce some fatigue, and there is a lack of new jokes.In the content of the plot, like the start of a tight sense of rhythm, immediately into, not dragging, feeling like a second ago just watched the first part. In the middle, there are many new characters, a little worried about whether the characters are too miscellaneous, but the follow-up development is clean and neat, not messy, some of the characters of the scene, so that the image of the key characters is very bright, but also make the emotional aspect reach a new high!Nezha's growth and transformation is a highlight of the film. In this film, he faced a more complex dilemma. When he learns more secrets hidden behind his life, and falls into the dilemma between friends and family, Nezha's heart gradually moves from the initial confusion to firm. He is no longer the hot-blooded, impulsive child who began to show a sense of responsibility beyond his years when faced with a series of difficult choices.The characterization of the little old man and Nezha is in sharp contrast. The little old man in the early stage of a high-level of justice, but later revealed the evil face, the contrast is huge. Nezha, as a demon child, is often misunderstood, seemingly dangerous, but his heart is kind and just, and he has been fighting against fate. The two are like mirror images, and this contrast deepens the plot level, easily triggers thinking about human nature, good and evil, appearance and essence, jumps out of the conventional character setting, and enhances the ideological depth and artistic value of the film. When I watched the movie, I suspected Shen Gongbao, deer boy or dragon, but I did not expect this \"old man who drinks milk powder\"! 😅",

        "content": "As an enthusiastic admirer of Chinese mythology - themed animations, the moment I learned about the release of \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\", my excitement knew no bounds. After experiencing this visually - arresting film, I was left with a lasting impression and a wealth of thoughts to mull over.The plot of \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\" is both captivating and intellectually stimulating. It continues the story of Nezha, a cherished figure in Chinese mythology, who is burdened with the fate of being a \"demon child\". The movie chronicles Nezha's odyssey as he confronts fresh challenges and battles against adversity. One of the most alluring aspects of the plot is its exploration of Nezha's internal strife. Despite being branded as a demon, he persistently endeavors to prove himself and perform good deeds. His conflict between his true self and society's expectations strikes a deep chord with the audience. It prompts us to reflect on how we are often judged by others based on initial impressions or pre - set labels, and how we ought to remain true to ourselves in the face of such misunderstandings.The character development in this movie is truly remarkable. Nezha, with his fiery temperament, unwavering resolve, and a heart brimming with kindness, stands at the heart of the story. His character arc, evolving from a rebellious and misunderstood child to a hero who dares to defy fate, is masterfully crafted. We can witness his growth not only in physical prowess but also in mental and emotional maturity. For instance, when he confronts the powerful dragon in the deep sea, his initial impetuosity gradually gives way to strategic thinking and self - sacrifice.Another character worthy of acclaim is Ao Bing, Nezha's friend and occasional rival. Their intricate relationship is a highlight of the film. Ao Bing, constrained by the responsibilities of his family and the Dragon Clan, is compelled to make tough choices. His loyalty to Nezha clashes with his duty to his family, generating substantial emotional tension in the narrative. This complex bond between the two characters enriches the story and showcases the multifaceted nature of friendship and loyalty.The visual effects of \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\" are nothing short of spectacular. The fight scenes are choreographed with great finesse, seamlessly blending fast - paced action with stunning visual effects. Whether it's Nezha's utilization of his magical weapons or the battles between the gods and demons, every scene is a visual extravaganza for the eyes.In addition to the aforementioned elements, the film also features a magnificent soundtrack that harmonizes perfectly with the visuals. The music ranges from energetic and thrilling during the battle scenes to soft and poignant during the more touching moments. It serves to enhance the overall ambiance of the film and draws the audience deeper into the story.In conclusion, \"Nezha: Mo tong nao hai\" is far from an ordinary animated movie. It is a masterpiece that seamlessly combines a compelling story, well - developed characters, breathtaking visuals, and a wonderful soundtrack. It not only provides entertainment but also imparts crucial messages about self - identity, friendship, and the courage to face challenges. It is a must - watch for both fans of Chinese mythology and animation enthusiasts worldwide. I eagerly anticipate more such high - quality Chinese animated films in the future.",

        "content": "Cleaner is essentially a half-baked Die Hard (1988) with horrible execution and boring characters. Can anyone in Hollywood or the modern filmmaking industry write a great character for Daisy Ridley? Are they doing this on purpose? She should be called Mary Sue in all of her films.Daisy's characters have no growth or arc in every story that she's in. If you weren't a fan of her as Rey in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, you'll definitely dislike what they did to her in Cleaner as well. This film is more like A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), which is the worst Die Hard.I'm no longer interested in watching 120-pound women win fights against 250-pound bodybuilders in these movies. Suspension of disbelief occurs when viewers \"turn off\" their critical sense. Good luck doing that for modern British and Hollywood flicks. No one has standards anymore.",

I loved her in \"The Force Awakens\" and \"The Rise of Skywalker\" and Kenneth Branaugh's remake of \"Murder on the Orient Express\". And last year's \"Sometimes I Think About Dying\" was very good.Now she has a new movie out called \"Cleaner\" with her and Clive Owen directed by Martin Campbell who directed \"Casino Royale\" with Daniel Craig as James Bond.It's kind of an action movie similar to \"Die Hard\" with Bruce Willis where Daisy plays a window cleaner for a skyscraper in London. Terrorists invade the building and take a bunch of people hostage and threaten to kill all of them if their demands are not met. It's up to Daisy to save the day and kill the bad guys and rescue the hostages.The film is well made and entertaining and once again Daisy Ridley proves to be a likable and charismatic leading lady and action heroine.A good time at the movies. I enjoyed this film.",

        "content": "Cleaner (2025) is the newest action thriller movie from Martin Campbell. Now I was a little skeptical about the movie at first, but I ended up liking it more than I was expected.Positives for Cleaner (2025):\nThe movie does have a cliche setup where you have someone who has to save a group of hostages from terrorists, but it's one of the better movies with that very cliche setup. Daisy Ridley does a good job as the main character and she's one of the more likable protagonists of these types of movies. You get some decent action sequences that do feel grounded enough to be believable. The movie moves a quick pace where it doesn't bore you with dumb stuff and keeps you entertained. Despite having a female lead, the movie doesn't get preachy with any of that dumb female empowerment crap we get nowadays. And finally, this is one of the better background noise movies as I did pay attention to a large majority of the movie.Negatives for Cleaner (2025):\nThe movie is basically another one of these Die Hard rip-offs except with a female lead in the John McClane role. The villains are very generic and forgettable.Overall, Cleaner (2025) is a movie I wasn't to thrilled about at first, but I did like it more than I did. If you like these types of movies, then I would highly recommend this movie.",

Clive Owen? I really hope he's in financial distress, as that would explain his agreeing to take part in this shameful Die Hard 1 rip-off. Why have such a great actor in it, only to have him disposed of so quickly?Was it because the producers and writers realised the yawning chasm in ability between Clive and Daisy Ridlley, panicked that he would show her up in every scene, sooo, gone! This movie exemplifies the difference between Hollywood today and yesteryear. Let's take a great movie, gender swap a real hero into a girl boss, fill it with unbelievable action scenes and have the terrorists swapped out for eco warriors.Save your time and money and hust watch Die Hard again.",

Daisy Ridley\ndelivers a standout performance as Joey Locke, a professional window cleaner forced to confront\nher painful past when her autistic brother, Michael (played by Matthew Tuck), is thrust back into her\ncare.The film weaves a compelling backstory: Joey and Michael grew up under an abusive father, and as\na child, Joey coped by escaping to the ledge of their high-rise apartment, developing an uncanny\ncomfort with heights. However, the real trauma comes from her inaction-watching her brother suffer\nwhile feeling powerless to intervene.Now an adult, Joey is determined not to abandon him again. When Michael is kicked out of a care\nhome for hacking their system-after uncovering financial corruption-she takes him in. But with no\nother options, she brings him to work at a towering skyscraper, where a dangerous situation unfolds\ninside the building. As chaos escalates, Joey must fight for both survival and redemption, ensuring\nshe doesn't fail Michael like she did in their childhood.The story is engaging, and Ridley's performance makes Joey's internal struggle feel raw and urgent.The tension builds effectively, though the opening is slightly slow-paced. Still, the payoff is worth it.With a mix of thrilling set pieces and emotional depth, Cleaner earns a solid 8.5/10.",

        "title": "Really nice fun action flick",
        "content": "Cleaner is fun action film. Decently made. Its not perfect but not bad either. Daisy Ridley was wonderful in this film. She was badass, hot and brilliant. It was nice to see her in such type of role & its totally different from all the characters she has played. Also this is best film Martin Campbell has made in last 8 years. My criticism for this film is that the screenplay could have been bit tighter & movie should have been longer, atleast 20 minutes longer also the final act of this film was weak, needed better execution & writing, its still decent but not that good. Daisy had less action than i expected but it was still nice. All the action sequences were very well choreographed. One of the highlights of this film is chemistry between Daisy Ridley & Mathew Tuck, both played siblings and their relationship in this film is very wholesome. Taz Skylar was wonderful, tho i think his character's motives could have been more compelling, his character was interesting, with better writing i think he would have been much more better & scarier. Overall its a fun film to watch, i myself had a very good time watching it. Specially seeing Daisy's performance which was different & great.",

There is a group of terrorists in a building and one lone person has to stop them-sound familiar? Daisy is the lone person, well, her brother Matthew is in the building at the time and Clive is the environmentalist activist/terrorist that takes hostages in the Energy Company's annual gala celebration in London and wants to expose the corruption they do on a daily basis. Taz plays an extremist with Clive that doesn't think Clive is forceful enough. Taz would prefer more of a mass murder scenario to make his point and just blow up the entire building. Daisy is a window washer working late, outside the building 50 floors up when Clive & company shows up. Oh yeah, Daisy is also ex_military so she knows how to handle herself and puts it to good use, taking out Clive's men when they come looking for her. It's not a bad movie but it's not breaking new ground.It's rated R for violence, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes.",

        "title": "Clean Stories, Writing, and Logic Show Potential For This Movie",
        "content": "LIKES:\nGood Authentic Dialog\nGood Visual Effects\nA Strong Lead\nA Well-Developed Villain\nA Good Message\nIntegrates Modern Themes Well\nA Nice Coordination Response Of Rescue\nA Thorough Introduction\nAction Is Pretty Cool At Times\nSummary:\nThe thing I give Cleaner is that the movie feels very authentic and a fairly realistic interpretation of a hostage situation. Campbell's story team has fashioned a situation that feels approachable in the takeover and the countermeasures to combat it. Cleaner doesn't load it with gravity-defying stunts, superhuman abilities, or these elaborate technological wonders to do it all. Instead, it feels like someone is the hero, who coincidentally has a history to take it on and do it in a logical approach. As Ridley's character, Joey is pulled into the situation, she has a logical means of attack that feels believable, with only a few moments feeling a bit situational and convenient. When the action arrives, the fighting has a nice balance of Hollywood choreography and realism, keeping to the feel of the movie but also being entertaining at the same time. A nice move for me; the integration of the story and character elements sort of spiced things up and helped me remain interested in the character plights as the scene evolved, instead of just an extra fight that felt like pure spectacle for the sake of time bloating. All of this was shot quite nicely, a beautiful blend of cinematography techniques that helped create this unique situation and visual effects that seemed one part CGI and one part authentic props that didn't drown that atmosphere Campbell was bringing to the film.In regards to the other plot elements, Cleaner succeeds better than other films I've seen in a while. Joey's story has a lot of modern-day interests rolled into one film and represents them in a manner that enhances their inclusion rather than undermining them. Her brother's autism, current International crises, and even the sexism aspects are surprisingly rolled into the plot rather than combatting it, which (again) helped give me more care for the other characters. The villain has more layers to him than many of the antagonistic roles call for: intelligence, skills, and an actual legitimate background that is paired well with the insanity. When mixed with the realistic approach mentioned above, the movie feels like a good drama to play in, and the characters feel as if they belong in a book I would read. Throw in some authentic dialog that incorporates the jargon, the attitude, and the emotions while still moving the plot, and you again impress me with the intelligence and coordination of the writing team in charge of the film. Their ability to blend all these components while still bringing a relevant message in a rather straightforward way is not an easy feat, and I was very impressed at what they had to say and how they said it. Finally, all the good writing is brought to life with a talented cast, everyone making legitimate representations without traipsing into melodramatic molds that so many shows choose to take. Ridley in particular showed more of her acting chops, and I applaud how much she can play an action woman when given the right script and direction. The others accomplish things well, but Ridley is the center of the web for me and pulls a lot of things together that I enjoyed in my viewing.DISLIKES:\nBackground Information Is Lacking\nCharacter Development Is Inconsistent\nThe Plot Is Mediocre and Pieced Together\nInconsistent Pace\nToo Realistic?Way Too Much Setup\nThe Action is wrapped up in about twenty minutes\nIs It Original Enough?Summary:\nWhere the movie fails for me, though, is that the film seems to have lost a lot of things in cuts or due to a time limitation. Much of the movie is about the setup, with almost an hour dedicated to her getting in the building to take care of business as the world setup exceeds its welcome. During that time, they tried to do a lot of character development, but I felt this character development was half-baked at times and too compressed, given how much air time she had to reflect. The connections with her mom, her army history, and even the antics with her brother have these well-timed and delivered moments, but something felt missing in these stories, and I wanted to see more of that exploited, given all the buildup. The character development for the cast also feels inconsistent, again, players that seemed like big pieces in the game of chess skirted over when there could have been a lot more to their involvement. In addition, the plot is not the most unique; a lot of elements are shared with Die Hard and not as well pieced together as I enjoy. It's not horrible by any account, but it just needs more finesse and originality to stand out or perhaps more action. Sadly, Cleaner suffers from condensed action for me; the John McClane effect is not as prominent or fun in this film, nor as creative in the execution against the band of bad guys. Perhaps that is where the realism hurts the film, in that the twenty minutes of action feels too short and needs more integration to help chop up that immense setup the movie takes.The VERDICT:\nCleaner is a movie that has a lot of fantastic elements that get their moments to shine and thrive. The smart writing and direction have pulled much of the film together, allowing for a tale that feels believable, in-depth, and relevant on many levels yet does not become too political or undermining at the same time. It makes good use of characters, intelligently crafted players, and logic that plays nicely with reality and does not require too many conveniences to accomplish. Ridley's acting shows so much talent, and her ability to keep so much together and play well with so many characters was a nice change of pace compared to other films she has been in. Under Campbell's direction, this film is well-executed on many technical aspects while also doing a solid job of an action story. Yet, the movie fails to fully unlock that potential for me. The setup is too long and doesn't have enough of the background diving to make it worth it, nor do some very interesting characters have their full delivery compared to all the time Joey gets. In addition, the action, while good at times, is too short and lacking for the time it took to get there in the nearly two-hour runtime. As such, the movie doesn't feel original, nor does it balance things out to the degree I think the advertising suggested it would. Upon reflection, this movie feels like an Amazon original/streaming original, and this would be the optimum area for you to invest your time and money into. When factoring everything together, I would give this film:\nAction/Drama/Thriller: 7.5\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

        "title": "Cleaner was not bad",
        "content": "Cleaner is a blaned action movie looks alike any Grindstone Entertainment Group direct-to-video film but on a limited run in my cinema, good for you scrambled that in the cinemas watch list. With a script that recycling every idea from a variety of box-office hits. Despite a talented cast and skilled director, it's little more than a spliced-together version of better films-specifically, riffs on the Die Hard (1988) scenario, where a single hero fights off terrorists in an isolated location. Most of such copycats & borrows followed in the 1990s and innovated with unique settings, such as a Navy battleship in Under Siege (1992), a plane in Passenger 57 (1992), a mountain in Cliffhanger (1993), a bus in Speed (1994), a hockey stadium in Sudden Death (1995), and the twin White House examples from 2013, Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down. I have seen so many movies like this that the subgenre has moved beyond mere variations on a theme and entered the realm of mind-numbing cliche, mainly because studios seldom attempt to deviate from a proven formula. A great movie may yet come along and revive the concept, but Cleaner is not. This was only a one-time watch, not thinking about this movie and not going to bother having it on vod because it would consider be a bust. 5.5/10 the action is good but characters dialogue is demanding sometimes.",

        "content": "I saw this one at the theaters about 30 minutes before writing this review.Overall - the movie is watchable; the 90 minutes didn't drag. But I wasn't blown away by the quality. I anticipate that I may forget this movie in short timeWhat I like: Daisy Ridley is likable; the scenes with her brother are charming; and I like the London setting. The action scenes are well-done. I was concerned, based on the premise, about scenes where a tiny girl overpowers some 200 pound men, but really - the movie doesn't over-do it. Daisy's character relies more on stealth than force/strength. The window-cleaning scenes are also fun. The movie captures the tenseness of being so high off the ground in some scenes. Nothing in the movie, from dialogue to CGI, is cringe or embarassingly low-qualityWhat I didn't like: the biggest flaw, by far, is that there really isn't much that we haven't seen before. The movie is an amalgam of action movies cliches, borrowing many elements from Die Hard and the Jean Claude Van Damme/Jason Statham movies. The entire plot basically goes in the direction that you would predict, aside from one early major death (no spoilers; I won't say). The other main issue is that the villains aren't as charming or interesting as the lead. The main villain is Lucas Santos, and there is a lot of attention towards his hatred of humanity (the movie itself seemingly plays on his views by referencing Thanos, who advocated killing half of humanity). Overall, Lucas Santos is too over-the-top psychotic, almost to the point of cartoonish. His diatribes against humanity begin to drag on. I also would've cast a different actor in that role. The actor who plays Lucas doesn't impart the fear that this role required.6.5/10.",

It is an atmospheric movie that is largely set inside the sky-tower building and the windows outside of it, where the protagonist is a window cleaner stuck on a lift outside the tall building and is trying to help stop the terrorists inside the building while largely restrained to the lift. It was effective as a thriller as it kept me at the edge of my seat. I would rate this movie 7 stars instead of 6 but the reason I gave it a 6 is because I just think it could have been done better. I left feeling that I had a good time, but it was just decent and not excellent.",

The action is serviceable, the villains are a yawn, and the characters, their motivations, dialogue, and their resolution are all too generic to leave a lasting impression. On top of that, the pacing drags in places, the ending fails to deliver, and the emotional beats between the siblings never quite land. Does it attempt to make a statement about environmental destruction and corporate accountability? If so, it does so in the dullest way possible.Die Hard, this is not, so the comparisons are moot. Here, the villains hold all the cards (they control the police, the building, and the hostages) and yet the heroine somehow becomes an inexplicable problem for them. There's a script issue, but also an execution problem, as Miss Ridley is competent in the role, but her casual attitude while committing \"action\" feels jarring and undermines any sense of real danger.At least it is short (90 minutes, and it feels even shorter).

This is very much like a Die Hard 1 remake, but totally different plot, story, and acting. It was quite well written and acted and the dialog was smart. All the action was very well choreographed and the fight scenes exceptional. Who cares if it was a die hard like movie? This was WAY better than anything Willis did after Red, and it wasn't really like die hard in the least other than a skyscraper. The older brother of Joey Michael Locke (Mathew Tuck) plays a very convincing autistic brother with a knack for hacking with other issues as well. Found this to be a very entertaining, engaging action movie that delivers. Would see this again a few more times and it has earned a place in my top 30 list to date. Nothing questionable, no nudity, lots of violence, some foul words and gestures but not really bad. Don't believe the bad reviews or thoughts of rip offs of die hard scripts, this was truly a fun ride! Enjoy!",

And she was only inside for about the last fifteen minutes. Anyway, I liked the set-up, I thought the characters felt real, the dialogue was good, and I was positively surprised by the political aspects of making the corrupt suits confess. But I was also disappointed that she spent THAT much time on the outside of the building, and that the political stuff only barely rated a mention at the end. They could have had a really cool movie here, but the structure and the plot decisions kept it from getting really good. I still give it a 7 star rating, and will probably watch it again sometime. It's a shame that a movie with such a good set-up managed to botch much of the promised potential in the third act. But I thought Daisy Ridley was really good, and this movie made me want to see her in more stuff.",

Sure, it was a watchable action thriller, but I have to say that I was left with an overwhelming sensation of having just watched a 2025 take on the 1988 movie \"Die Hard\". It was a bit odd that writers Simon Uttley, Paul Andrew Williams and Matthew Orton collectively couldn't muster more than a remake of the 1988 \"Die Hard\" movie. But hey, \"Cleaner\" was a watchable movie, nonetheless.I was only familiar with leading actress Daisy Ridley and Clive Owen on the cast list. And it was a shame that Clive Owen wasn't given a bigger part to play in the movie, because he could definitely have spruced up the movie quite a bit.There is a fair amount of action throughout the course of the movie, and it looks good. And I will say that it definitely helped to lift up the movie.\"Cleaner\" is a movie worth checking out if you enjoyed the 1988 movie \"Die Hard\". But this time it is with a female lead.My rating of director Martin Campbell's 2025 action thriller \"Cleaner\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",

Top-billed cast members are killed off way too early and Ms. Ridley just stands around doing nothing for the half of its length.At no point during the 90 minutes runtime do you get the feeling that the plot is actually about taking down terrorists. There's zero attempts of the Police to do anything meaningful, nor a John McClane who takes matters into his own hands, cleaning story after story of bad guys. The only motivation of our heroine is to save her whiny brother who happens to be an innocent bystander in the siege of the corpo tower. And at the end it becomes just that - a family drama. Lots of unnecessary cursing and screaming included.I didn't have to pay to see this movie, but I still feel ripped off. And to think this crap fest came from the same director as the universally acclaimed and beloved \"Casino Royale\" just blows my mind.I'll give it 3 very generous stars because I like Daisy Ridley.

Was it because they were so enthralled by what they were seeing? I doubt it, because the movie is basically just one \"funny\" gag after another, yet the laughter was few and far between. The only person who seemed to be consistently enjoying it was a lady whom I'm pretty sure was taking advantage of the fact that the theater serves adult beverages.Giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because I think the animation style was unique and very well done. However the frenzied pace and colorful style seem keyed to a very specific young-adult and adult audience. Otherwise it's just a boring, nonsensical bullet train that whizzes past any possibility of connecting with the larger audience, and leaves you simultaneously checking your watch every ten minutes and wondering where the last hour and a half of your life went when nothing seemed to have actually happened.",

The characters come across as disappointingly flat, each lacking genuine depth or development. From beginning to end, their motivations and arcs remain stagnant. The plots felt clearly pieced together (I can even name books and chapters). The action sequences and visual effects feel serviceable at best, but there's nothing particularly groundbreaking or memorable about them.I was hoping to see something like The Wild Robot but ended up getting Dragon Ball Z. The result is a middle-of-the-road adaptation that neither celebrates the potential of its source material nor brings anything new and exciting to the table. While Dog Man might please a handful of devoted fans who simply want to see familiar pages brought to life on screen, it misses the mark when it comes to capturing the imagination of a broader audience.",

This movie was so...zany that's honestly the best word I can think of to describe it. Both the story and the dialogue was 100mph from beginning to end. You couldn't fit a cigarette paper between one character ending his sentence to another starting theirs. And they were all yelling. There was almost no talking. All the characters were shouting. There were very few slower parts for you to take a breath and process what you just watched. Everything in between those parts was CRASH! BANG! WOOPS! AHHHHH! It was loud, it was in your face, and It was relentless. They even played to this chaos with one of the robot characters named 80HD (ADHD). Anyone with visual and audio stimulus issues should avoid this movie. By time the movie ended, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.The story wasn't even that good. I mean, I got it but I just barely got it after muscling my way through all the stimuli, and I'm 40yo. I'm confident no kid watching this will understand the plot and story. They're just watching for the visuals. And the visuals are distracting from the fact that the story was mediocre at best.Children's movies made today do kids a great disservice. There was once a time when kids had the attention span to sit through a movie that wasn't a constant assault on the eyes and ears and there was a complex (for a kids movie) storyline that involved character development, something this movie didn't have any of.The only reason I'm giving it 4/10 is because my son said he loved it.

A dog head on a mans body is a cool concept, and certainly can explore the realms of interesting ideas.The first couple books in the series are great, and are similar to the start of the movie whereas you have a main villain (Flippy or Petey), and Dog Man needs to stop them. The execution of these scenes were great, and pretty enjoyable.I had a good time with all the actions scenes, it felt like a pretty good cops and robbers movie and I feel like they could've made it one. This could've been a unique story in the franchise. Instead, they chose to do an amalgamation of all the books. This is fine, but for me personally the books really fell off after the introduction of lil petey. I was concerned they were going to go to this route with the movie, and unfortunately they did.Well this is represents the books well, I just don't think the story was good. The second half and later parts of the movie were just bland. Felt like I've seen it a million times before in other pieces of media. They had the opportunity to explore a new and creative story but they didn't take it.Some people don't like when media strays too far away from the books, but in the end I think this movie would've really benefited from it. Maybe I'm judging it too harshly since the target demographic is probably like 6 year olds, but yeah, could've been better. There were plot lines that they could've used, such as when we find out the guy who was Dog Mans body has a girlfriend. It's explained that she just instantly left them, but it could've led to a different story had it been done differently. The movie had its moments, but isn't anything crazy.",

I think Dreamworks could have done better in making this film, and some of the animation was pretty poor, for example, dog man ears comb off a chicken. Dreamworks has done some brilliant films in past, but this one just doesn't hit it. I have it a 3 as it is watchable, but not a good film at all. Can't see what's so good about it and there was only two of us in the cinema watching this movie. I wouldn't waste your money to go and see this Flim.",

Such a great adventure about inventions, Dog Man, awesome villain throughout by Pete Davidson and news anchor which is great too.Everything about this kids movie goofy is so well made, the characters are amazing, colors are exceptional, plenty of charm, and quite funny. I work part time at my nearest theater I hope plenty of families get to see Dog Man whenever possible perfect for all ages and an awesome perspective on giving chances to those whom have done wrong.

Also, there was a short film before it called \"The Bad Guys\", which was hilarious and the perfect intro to the film. I don't know that it was on par with the original \"Shrek\" or \"Prince of Egypt\", but it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you have kids in the household.In conclusion, check this film out; you won't regret it.",

        "title": "A near-perfect Adaptation from DreamWorks!",
        "content": "Dog man is one of the most anticipated movies from DreamWorks animation , A studio known for the Masterpieces it contributed to the Animated movie industry and that's a big reason why everyone should and was exited for this adaptation because DreamWorks Nails EVERY book adaptation it has ever done , from Shrek , Puss in boots ( the best movie ever ) , and HTTYD franchies and the bad guys and much more and so far they hadn't lost their streak of the amazing book to movie adaptation and dog man is one of them.What makes the movie so good is how Accurate it is to the books , from the characters and how they behave and just the overall story of Dog man and as a bonus we get more backstory here rather than the books and that's what exactly Dav Pilkey wanted , he wanted this movie to explore the characters a bit more than the books and by adding that little backstory it really served the book and the audience very well.The movie is Very funny and kids will laugh at it even more because this is probably the most childish book to movie adaptation that DreamWorks ever made because it's more silly and not serious at all comparing to the other adaptations DreamWorks made and that is a positive because it follows the book very well and it did it's job at being very very funny and fast paced and those two things were almost perfected by the screenplay team.The cast are great Pete davidson as Petey the evil cat was very good his screams his calmness his overall voice acting was a highlight in this movie and he did better than i expected , Lil Rel Howery as Chief was probably the best voice acting performance because he went ALL IN to capture the character's expressions from the screams to the joy and just a full circle of emotions that lil Rel Howery made Isla Fisher as Sarah the reporter was also good but man, Billy Boyd did an AMAZING job as this little extra character that brought some extra laughs to the mix , his character \"Seamus\" was such a cool character in this movie , he didn't have a lot of screentime but whenever he was there his character was very funny and i think that his accent was a very big factor and yep the other voice actors did a good job also , and we also got Ricky Gervais as Flippy which was a decent comic villain and did a good job voicing him.The animation style is very good , it's unique , it's something no one ever seen before , they mixed the old animation from the Captain underpants movie and added a new animation style that was VERY VERY good it was so well done , the letters on the screen , the cutaways , the montages, DreamWorks animators went all IN in this movie with this unique animation style that solidified the movie's core by bringing those comically large letters and comically actions and movements that made the movie more likeable and funnier which in terms of comedy this movie has got it in every corner.Overall DreamWorks (As always) gives us those absolutely amazing , fun , family films that just makes you extra happy and the anticipation really paid off because the Dog man movie is a Solid start for the First DreamWorks film of the year , Peter Hastings did a good job directing this movie and i thank every single member of the legendary company (DreamWorks) for making this film Very good. 8/10.",

A single propellor plane nosedives towards the snowy mountains, and smashes into the snow, but somehow, erm, flies through and keeps going the other side. The conceit that they are \"stuck in the freezing wilderness inside a small plane\" is discovered half-way through to be solvable because... oh the air Marshall had an iPhone with satellite connectivity that she forgot about? That works with crystal-clear communication every time.Truly terrible film-making. Avoid at all costs.",

Her performance is far better than a film like this would ordinarily demand. It's shot well, with the tension and pacing being spot on.I think it shows Gibson's versatility as a director.

To make matters worse, the cinematography is mediocre at best-uninspired shots, poor framing, and nothing visually striking to salvage the train wreck.It's not just disappointing-it's insulting to the audience's intelligence.

Then I noticed it was directed by Mel. So, I thought why not, I've seen everything else he's directed. So I used my points to go see it, and I must say. I think it definitely is a little better than how it comes across in the ad. The filmmaking is definitely solid. The film creates some fairly tense moments, even though it's one of those films where you sort of have an idea as to how it will likely end. It is a fairly straightforward and simple film for sure. However it is well made, and the script is definitely not as unintelligently written as most Hollywood films these days. The dialogue is perhaps a little harsh for some, but that actually also helps this film build the decent amount of tension that it needs to work reasonably well. I definitely don't regret going to see it on the big screen. For many people, this will be worth a watch for sure.I think Mel may have taken this project in order to help fund his own passion projects, and why not? They definitely made a decent little film out of this in my view. In fact, I'd say it's a fairly good date movie if you all can handle some creepy dialogue and a little bit of gore.What is also refreshing about this script, is that even though a female has a major role in the film. The script doesn't enter into any of these overly naive and ridiculous political narratives that so many other Hollywood films these days do. If I see another one of those films, I'm going to be sick right in the theatre. So look out people.6.5/10.",

The compositing for this was best done in After Effects or Nuke Indie.Simply hilarious. The next 60 minutes of the film only took place on the plane. But 60 minutes on a plane without a real story is hard. The only constant storyline was the guy on the phone arranging a date with Madolyn.

Mob,whistleblower, corrupt official, attempt at assassinating witness you get the picture. Looks like Mel isn't getting anything worthwhile script to work on so decide to make this crap into a movie.

Some notable examples were the complete lack of urgency or professionalism from anyone that gets on the radio or phone with the Marshall. The fact that the movie picks and chooses when characters can hear each other in the plane or not hear each other. At one point Marky Mark's character is handcuffed to the back of the plane against the fuselage and claims that he can't be shot because Michelle Dockery's character may miss and hit the fuel tanks. Only problem is the fuel tanks are in the wings. At another point a flare gun is used inside of the plane along with a fire extinguisher both of which would be tremendously hazardous to use in an enclosed space but someone just cracks a window and everything is hunky dory. Later in the movie a gun is fired inside the plane the bullets stop dead in the comically thin front seat with no issue when in reality they would have traveled straight through and into the engine compartment of the airplane. The best part was the ending when the plane is being landed by Michelle Dockerys character. She runs out of fuel short of the runway and yet the prop continues to spin at full speed and she crashes with enough force to tear the plane apart and throw Mark Wahlberg out of the side. Mark Wahlberg proceeds to get up virtually unscathed from the crash and get run over by a fire truck that doesn't even stop or anything after killing a person.The ending is also so unbelievable and cheesy it almost made me want a refund. Topher Grace gets stabbed twice and is inches from death but he is left alone in an ambulance and almost assassinated. Where aree the paramedics that put him in there? No where to be found I guess.I'd say only go see this movie if you want a good laugh. There were moments of almost greatness but it felt like a rushed money grab from Mel and an awfully written story from the writer. Parts of the movie seriously sounded like they were written by ChatGPT. It's watchable but only just barely. 4/10.",

        "content": "Flight Risk, is a film that had the potential to be a gripping thriller but ultimately falls flat due to a combination of poor storytelling, lackluster performances, and a general sense of predictability. Despite the star power behind it, the movie fails to deliver on its promise of high-stakes tension and instead becomes a forgettable entry in the action-thriller genre.One of the most glaring issues with it, is its uninspired and formulaic plot. The story revolves around a pilot (played by Wahlberg) who becomes embroiled in a dangerous situation while transporting a fugitive. While this premise could have been the foundation for a tense and engaging narrative, the execution is disappointingly bland. The plot unfolds in a predictable manner, with few surprises or twists to keep the audience engaged. The stakes never feel particularly high, and the resolution is both rushed and unsatisfying, leaving viewers with a sense of anticlimax.Mark Wahlberg, who has proven his acting chops in other films, seems to be on autopilot here. His performance lacks the depth and intensity needed to make his character compelling. Instead, he comes across as one-dimensional, with little emotional range or development throughout the film. The supporting cast doesn't fare much better, with most characters feeling underdeveloped and serving as little more than plot devices. The lack of strong character arcs or meaningful interactions further detracts from the film's overall impact.The direction by Mel Gibson is another weak point. Known for his work in front of and behind the camera, Gibson's efforts here feel uninspired and lack the visceral energy that has characterized some of his previous projects. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of tedium punctuated by brief moments of action that fail to generate any real excitement. The film's attempts at building suspense often fall flat, as the tension is undermined by predictable plot developments and a lack of genuine stakes.The screenplay is equally problematic, plagued by clichéd dialogue and a lack of originality. The characters frequently spout lines that feel forced and unnatural, making it difficult for the audience to connect with them or become invested in their fates. The film also struggles to balance its tone, veering awkwardly between moments of attempted seriousness and unintentional humor. This tonal inconsistency further detracts from the overall experience, making it hard to take the film seriously.Visually, Flight Risk is equally unremarkable. The cinematography lacks creativity, with few memorable shots or sequences that stand out. The action scenes, which should be the film's highlight, are poorly choreographed and lack the intensity needed to leave a lasting impression. The special effects are serviceable but nothing more, failing to elevate the film or add any sense of spectacle.",

        "content": "'Flight Risk' is a film that I'm not totally convinced by, though in the end I think I like it. On the one hand, it has inconsistent suspense, has dodgy humour and doesn't truly entertain like an action thriller ought to. On the other hand, the performances are good, the exterior plane shots are convincing and the twisty nature makes it watchable.Mark Wahlberg (amusing accent), Michelle Dockery and Topher Grace are actors that I enjoyed watching here, Grace manages to overcome some cringey dialogue that was (hopefully, for his sake) written for him; the banter isn't great, the more serious stuff he is solid at. Monib Abhat also has iffy comedy, though does make it work more; a mostly voice role helps.Overall, a fine time at the movies. Like last week, I was fortunately able to watch it as part of a double header on the big screen - this time with Steven Soderbergh's 'Presence'. Back-to-back 90 minutes, I'm cool with long run times but sometimes its nice to have films of such a length. For what it's worth, that other flick is the better.",

        "title": "This Flight is Fun, Funny, and Somewhat Thrilling. Don't Risk Your Expectations, Though",
        "content": "LIKES:\nFunny Dialogue\nActing That Goes With Comedy\nA Decent Character Story\nGood Visuals In The Limited Setting\nSome Clever Maneuvers\nGood Pace\nA Blend of Thriller And Comedy\nSummary:\nIf you have seen the trailers, you know the movie's plot sounds a bit farfetched, and you would be right on the money with that assumption. Flight Risk is a movie that is meant to be something serious but turns out to be a silly ordeal intertwined with those elements. Our cast is essentially three actors trying to make a tale with some heart, suspense, and a good drive toward the fate of an accomplice for the local crime lord. On some levels, the movie accomplishes this better than I had expected, given the absurdity of the plot. It's a movie with better character development, with two of the characters going deeper and connecting far past the initial expectations of the opening scene.The performances are not the best executed, but they are fun and believable at times as they handle the very shaky script that is not to be taken seriously from what I saw with the movie. Dockery is the most serious of the bunch and accomplishes the Crime/Thriller role the best with the focus, seriousness, and agent-like composure she wields professionally, but she also has moments of vulnerability that are authentic and well-written. Grace starts out like another knock-off to That 70's show but then evolves into more as the flight continues to hit turbulence and the fight for survival begins. Despite the serious attempts, though, the movie is drowned out in comedy, to which Wahlberg excels with his corny delivery, odd energy, and that slightly laughable grin he has made his trademark brand.I laughed a lot at this film because of the dialogue and clever bits of humor mixed in; the stretches were balanced enough to make things fun without being too annoying. Once the thrills started, the laughs continued as well from the crazy things they had the plane go through, the actions very unrealistic to the level that it's so bad, it's ironically good. The thrills keep coming, the pace exciting with it, and the story laid out to take the right breaks to expand upon the characters. It's a nice blend and provides much more to the entertainment aspects that impressed me with just how fun it was to see it all come together. Throw in a good set of visuals to make the effects look realistic and you've accomplished yet another fun aspect of the movie to help distract from the ludicrous project Flight Risk is.DISLIKES:\nCheesy\nWahlberg's Character Is Eh\nA Bit Too Comedy\nBetter Story/Twist Execution\nSummary:\nThe movie is cheesy, and you have to be ready to suspend that disbelief to levels that might be annoying to some fans. All the positive things mentioned above help this, but there are still moments that stretch things too much for me to ignore. The comedy does get a bit overbearing at times, feeling like a sitcom in how forced and frequent the jokes are without the full delivery and timing to build it up. Those moments do get a tad stale for me and might be the same for those with a low tolerance for more comedy and less story. The tale has its ups and downs, but I felt it needed a better execution of the story and the \"twists\" that lie with it. Flight Risk needed to be in something other than a plane or have a story taking place during it, like Speed did, to help add more dynamic telling and give us something more than a conveniently designed plane. This is done via the radio, but it still felt strained, with eye-rolling moments that were just too much to believe and swallow down. Throw in the lame use of Wahlberg's character for comedic relief and a visual antagonist, and the story takes further hits from the expectations placed by the trailers. More character development, psychological warfare, and storytelling with him were the biggest things I wanted from this movie for improvement, especially given how well Wahlberg can make a character shine if given the material. It is another case of too much compacted into one setting, and even though the thrills hit at times, they just can't match some better thrillers I've seen in the past.The VERDICT:\nFlight Risk meets many expectations in what the trailers laid out. It's a cheesy movie, full of contrived moments and disbelief to help add artificial thrills to the movie and try to get that entertaining Friday Flick that they love so well. A strong acting game makes the material more fun, with comedic delivery and banter being the primary meat in this sandwich to munch on, with a few vulnerable moments to act as an appetizer. The thrills are enjoyable despite the unrealistic moments, but there was more that could have come together to unleash the full potential of the movie and address the story limitations that a single plane location provides. Still, this pace, the visual effects, and the fun that I had with this movie make it a suitable one to hit the theater to watch and kill some time. My scores for the movie are:Action/Crime/Drama/thriller: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.5.",

Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot with a side hustle in murder, and Topher Grace is his unlucky passenger who probably wishes he'd just taken a Greyhound.Wahlberg spends the entire movie playing a maniac with a pilot's license, delivering one-liners while throwing people out of moving planes. Grace, meanwhile, is the human embodiment of \"I made a huge mistake,\" trying to survive long enough to testify against mobsters while dodging both assassins and in-flight snacks that probably aren't FAA-approved.The action scenes are ridiculous in the best way-fistfights during turbulence and emergency landings. It's so over-the-top, you'll find yourself rooting for Grace to make it while secretly wondering if Wahlberg could land your next Spirit Airlines flight.Hilarious, chaotic, and weirdly charming for a movie about a killer pilot. If you love absurd action flicks, Flight Risk will have you booking aisle seats just to be safe.",

The most interesting thing here is Frank Gastambide's character as some kind of villain, very unusual for him. He is not a gangster, not a cop, just some kind of mercenary working for the palaces and tracking down punks. As in some crime movies where robbers pull a heist against a mafia casino and are hunted my mafia goons. I love this Gastambide's role, but I really disllike the romance element here, between Olivier Marchal's daughter - Zoé and the young father with his daughter. It has nothing to do here, and the kids scenes really annoyed me. Back to Frank Gastambide, he should play in a further Olivier Marchal's film. The acting here is superb, even for supporting roles. But it could not have been grittier. It is tough, with good surprises. There was another thing that annoyed me, pulling a heist, armed robbery, without gloves....

He brings depth and authenticity to his role, making the audience empathize with his struggles.

        "content": "\"Khakee: The Bengal Chapter\" Season 2 is a textbook example of how not to follow up a brilliant first season. After the gripping narrative, raw performances, and immersive storytelling of Season 1, my expectations were sky-high. Unfortunately, this sequel failed on every conceivable level. It's not just a bad show - it's an insult to fans who fell in love with the original.Let's start with the most glaring issue: the lack of originality. Season 1's success stemmed from its grounded storytelling, tense cat-and-mouse chase, and morally grey characters. Each twist felt earned, and the stakes were genuinely high. Season 2, however, substitutes all of that with lazy writing and cliched plot devices. The narrative feels painfully predictable, and the \"twists\" are visible from a mile away. It's as if the makers prioritized quantity over quality, dragging the story out with unnecessary subplots and redundant scenes.Character development, which was the soul of Season 1, is nonexistent here. The morally complex characters we loved are either absent or reduced to shallow caricatures. The new additions are poorly written and lack the depth and charm that made the first season so compelling. The dialogues are lifeless, the emotional moments fall flat, and the confrontations lack the intensity they should have carried.Even the performances are disappointing. In Season 1, the cast breathed life into the narrative, delivering raw, authentic portrayals. Here, the actors seem disinterested, delivering their lines with no conviction. It's hard to blame them when the script gives them nothing to work with. The antagonists, in particular, are laughably one-dimensional. Gone are the morally ambiguous villains we loved to hate; instead, we get generic bad guys with no substance.Visually, the show also takes a hit. While Season 1 captured the grittiness of Bihar with striking cinematography, the Bengal setting in Season 2 feels like a missed opportunity. The locations lack character, the camera work is uninspired, and the direction fails to build tension or atmosphere. Even the background score, which once heightened every scene, now feels intrusive and exaggerated.Moreover, the pacing is atrocious. Episodes drag endlessly without adding any value to the story. Moments that should have been hard-hitting are diluted by filler content. Instead of the adrenaline-pumping thrill we experienced in Season 1, we're left checking the time, hoping the episode ends soon.What's most frustrating is how the show undermines its own legacy. The creators had a golden opportunity to build upon the complex world they introduced. Instead, they took the lazy route, banking on the brand name without putting in any effort to deliver a worthy continuation.In conclusion, \"Khakee: The Bengal Chapter\" Season 2 is a soulless cash grab. It's a slap in the face to the audience who invested their time and emotions in Season 1. If you haven't started it yet, save yourself the disappointment. Rewatch Season 1 instead - that's where the real brilliance lies.Final Verdict: A catastrophic sequel that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. Avoid at all costs.",

While the show is entertaining, it suffers from predictability and an overpowered protagonist. The cop feels more like a superhero than a real officer-somehow, despite facing enemies in point-blank range, he never takes a bullet, which kills the realism.The pacing is another issue. The story moves in a way that feels abrupt rather than fluid, making it hard to stay immersed. For a detective thriller, there's surprisingly little actual detective work. Instead, the focus shifts heavily towards the antagonists, making it feel like their story rather than one about \"Khakee\"-the iconic uniform of the Indian police.The editing also leaves much to be desired. In the second episode, there's a drone shot showing the current Chief Minister of West Bengal, which is an obvious oversight given the show's time setting. Additionally, multiple scenes feature shops and locations that weren't from that era, which hurts authenticity.That said, the script is decent on paper. If the show had focused more on actual investigative elements rather than endless fight sequences, it would have been much stronger. The action scenes themselves could have been choreographed better, as they often feel exaggerated and unrealistic.On the bright side, the performances are commendable. The actors do their best with the material they're given, making some moments genuinely engaging. But overall, Khakee: The Bengal Chapter could have been a much better show with tighter storytelling, better editing, and more depth in its investigative aspects.",

The whole concept of the series is great for people who want to get hooked to thrilling story.There is not much to say bad about this as it was way better than most other series ott produces.However there are 2 things I did notice to be a bit lack luster.1. The start and end of the series is quite typical. Don't get me wrong it's still great but it didnt have the hook and satisfaction like Bihar chapter which is completely fine as both of them are way too different. A certain improvement would have been to hook viewers to the characters. Saptashri was a huge climax according to series but throughout the series it didn't feel as connected to viewers as it was in Bihar chapter.2. Bagha da especially faced this issue of not being too connected to into the story.It would have been so good to see how bagha actually evolved into the crime leader he was instead of just a small 2 part flashback of him. Even when he does it felt too early and too detached. He was supposed to be the gruesome guy in series but ended up being a old guy with a huge ego and no actual danger. They should have really worked on him as it would have actually made it way way better.Those 2 are the reason for my 9/10 otherwise it's a 10/10.

It draws parallel to the long Left Front rule in Bengal, which was overthrown by the current ruling government, Ms. Mamata Banerjee. The parallels with the real-life story simply cannot be missed: with an accurate portrayal of the politics and gangs operating under the aegis of politicians, it becomes even better.The actors did a good job of making the story believable. The lead antagonists did a very good job and made the character believable. However, there were certain fight scenes (especially the airport one) which definitely looked like it is a staged fight. It is okay to stage a fight while shooting a scene, but at least make it believable.My main gripe with this series is that it was originally recorded in Hindi. Why on earth are Bengali people speaking among themselves in Hindi? I understand that Hindi and Urdu are popular languages in West Bengal, but portraying that all the people speak in Hindi is doing a disservice to the state and removes originality from the story. One popular argument is that to make it marketable, the original script is in Hindi. But there is a famous movie named Parasite, which did not have a word of English, yet won the Oscars for Best Picture. So it is more important to stay original than bend to suit the \"perceived market.\" Interested watchers can easily switch to a dubbed language of their choice.",

        "title": "Another Netflix template action movie to add to the trash heap",
        "content": "It's hard not to be a little insulted by Netflix sometimes. They seem to have a very specific type of movie they like to put out time and again and it really is aimed at the lowest level of movie-viewer. This tacky, predictable and safe movie template that they have down and throw out a dozen times a year is just awful to watch and 'Back in Action' is just another one to throw on the trash heap.It was nice to see Cameron Diaz again after 11 years. I always enjoyed her charisma and sass that she was able to bring to a role. Here though she was not her usual self. Whether that was the script or her being a bit rusty I'm not sure. She didn't have any chemistry with Jamie Foxx though whatsoever.Those are two fine actors and they both felt wooden the entire film. Foxx did have some health problems during filming though it is worth noting, so I'm happy to give him a pass. The fact that he completed the film at all is commendable.Also I could've done without the bratty kid characters. Did anyone consider making them likable so that we might care about their fate a little more?Sometimes you can say, turn your brain off and you'll have a good time. With this movie you need to turn your brain off to avoid the frustration of the absurdly stupid script and story, but you're still not going to have a good time if you do. Things like a plane crashing into the side of a mountain and then characters just walking away without a scratch are just the tip of the iceberg. The fun element was severely lacking in this movie.I tried so hard to get into this movie and enjoy the ride but I just couldn't. Mostly I was just bored. A generous 4/10.",

        "content": "This film is yet another soulless, uninspired cash grab that proves Hollywood has long since abandoned any semblance of creativity. It's a paint-by-numbers template movie with no heart, no originality, and nothing to set it apart from the endless stream of derivative drivel churned out year after year. The plot is a shameless rehash of stories we've seen countless times before, cobbled together with a checklist of clichés rather than any genuine effort at storytelling.The characters are flat and one-dimensional, mere cardboard cutouts going through the motions, and the dialogue is so bland and predictable it feels like it was written by an algorithm. Any attempts at emotional depth or cleverness are overshadowed by the film's relentless pandering and lazy reliance on overused tropes.It's almost insulting how this film assumes its audience will settle for mediocrity. Hollywood clearly believes that all it needs to do is slap together some familiar scenes with a fresh cast, add a flashy trailer, and audiences will lap it up. This is cinema at its laziest and most formulaic, a vapid experience designed solely to rake in box office dollars without providing a shred of originality, creativity, or thought.Save your time, your money, and your brain cells. At best, this film might serve as background noise while you scroll through your phone, but even then, it's a stretch. Hollywood needs to stop insulting its audience's intelligence and start taking risks again, because regurgitated content like this does nothing but prove the industry has run out of ideas.",

        "content": "I was hestitant to watch this movie. Sure Jamie and Diaz are fun to watch, but not in a Netflix movie. The movie is about the two of them beging spies. Diaz is pregant so they want to quit their spy lifes.Once having kids growing up as teenagers, the kids think their parents are boring and have their own way of living their lives. The parents past are chasing after them and the kids get to know their parents are highly trained spies and everything ends well for the family.This is just an avegage movie. We don't get to see some new things here. Jamie and Diaz are caught up in fighting scenes. These were highly choreographed. Diaz talks about her mother all the time, so we know that character will be played by Helen Mirren or Glenn Close.The beginning of the movie kind of had a \" True lies\" touch to it. The movie feels very forced. Don't really know why Foxx and Diaz signed up for this. Things that happen feel random and don't really have a bigger meaning in the movie. The bad guy Chuck is helped by a little boy in a dress who is his tech nerd. But that character does not reach a full potential like how Ruby Rose did in John Wick 2.So if you want to waste your time, this movie is just good to do it with while eating a happy meal from the MaccieD. But if you have some taste of movies, skip this one and just go outside and enjoy the fresh air.",

        "title": "It's pure formula through and through, but Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx have fantastic chemistry and elevate the material",
        "content": "15 years after leaving behind their careers as superspies by faking their deaths, Emily (Cameron Diaz) and Matt (Jamie Foxx) have started a family and now live a quiet suburban life with their teenage daughter Alice (McKenna Roberts) and young son Leo (Rylan Jackson) while dealing with parental challenges like teenage rebellion and screentime. After following their daughter to a late night rendezvous at a night club where they use their martial arts training against some aggressive young men, the two are visited by their former handler Chuck (Kyle Chandler) who warns them the video of their fight has gone viral and that both the CIA and arms dealer Gor (Robert Besta) will likely track them down in the hopes of acquiring the ICS, a digital weapon that Matt hid unbeknownst to Emily if in case they ever needed leverage and to keep it from falling in the wrong hands. After Chuck is killed the two flee with their children while dodging assassins and mercenaries as they head to England where the ICS is hidden with Emily's estranged mother Ginny (Glenn Close).Back in Action is the latest star studded genre film from Netflix and comes to us from writers Seth Gordon and Brendan O'Brien the former of whom also directs. The film marks Foxx's fourth collaboration with the streamer following works like Project Power, Day Shift and they very enjoyable They Cloned Tyrone and also marks the first role for Cameron Diaz since 2014's Annie after the actress took a hiatus due to the travel demands of acting. Back in Action doesn't break any new ground when it comes to this kind of high concept action-comedy film, but despite being pure formula it is elevated by the strong chemistry and comedic timing of Foxx and Diaz.Back in Action follows a similar framework you've seen with this type of format which can be traced back to things like True Lies from the 90s or Romancing the Stone and its various immitators of the 80s (like American Dreamer for instance). This kind of format has been used time and time again (This Means War, Killers, The Spy Who Dumped Me, Ghosted, etc.) and if you're familiar with the formula it's very much in play here. The opening sequence involving Emily and Matt infiltrating Gor's mansion to obtain the ICS is actually quite well done and features some good choreography even if the plane crash sequence maybe is a tad overdone. It helps that Diaz and Foxx do have really good chemistry with each other and it's a marked improvement from last year's Argylle that had terrible chemistry between its leads and an overly bloated runtime. The first act after the opening sequence is probably the weakest part of the film with some very on the nose \"generation gap\" humor with Alice and Leo two-dimensional Gen Z and Gen Alpha archetypes whose position is really only to react to the reveal of their parents superspy past without really being fully fleshed characters themselves and it's the kind of thing that feels very \"sitcom\" in its usage of awkward humor. Once the family is forced on the run it adheres pretty closely to the patterns of this kind of formula action comedy but there are some amusing moments especially with Glenn Close as Emily's mother and some good against type stunt casting where the prior roles associated with two actors help make a pretty obvious twist have more weight than you'd expect.Back in Action is not a great movie but it's a decent rental especially when you consider prior spy films from last year like Canary Black and Argylle that didn't work at all. If this were a theatrical film, I'd say it's something you can rent and be reasonably entertained. Take that for what you will.",

But, my recommendation is to turn it off then and not waste the next 90 minutes of your life.For one thing, there is nothing that kills onscreen chemistry between 2 attractive people who are supposedly \"super spies\" than having them interact as a couple with an incredibly bratty teenager who they are afraid of. Who wants to see Diaz practically begging her daughter to like her with the kid rolling her eyes and another young son tied to a phone. Who wants to see Foxx - whose characters on In Living Color would have gone on a long scold with that girl that would have scared her straight - act like he's not even part of the family, let alone a strong dad, and just run away and let Diaz, the mom, try to (incompetently) parent. NOT sexy.Are all screenwriters, producers, directors and actors in Hollywood plagued IRL with kids they can't control and who are just terrible and worse - boring and predictable? Because those seem to be the only character traits any kids in movies have. These people should go out in the rest of the country and interact with families with kids who are competently parented and where the parents don't want to be their kids' friends. Those kids are alright. But, in this movie, the little boy was cute and sweet but the teenager made me not care what happened to her so when, inevitably, she's endangered, I yawned.Then - Glenn Close - Oh my word. What can I say. SO DISAPPOINTING. It's beyond sad to see one of the greatest actors of the last few generations be reduced to a short (she's such a towering presence in most of her films I never realized how short she is), stocky, badly dressed, oversexed \"secret agent\" who is given a \"boyfriend\" who is dumb and ugly that she apparently (but completely implausibly) can't keep her hands off. And, given lines that are uber cringe which even she can't pull off. Sorry, Glenn, but Helen Mirren showed how to do this in Red. This was beneath you. And, the guy who plays her boyfriend, as someone else noted, must be related to someone in production. His screeching behavior was nauseating.Lastly, the plot. Really!? We are supposed to believe that super villians were still after some software key that could unlock everything in the world 15 years after it was lost? Um, do the writers know how fast software evolves? If this was developed 15 years previously but lost, it likely would have taken about 1-2 years for someone to recreate it or develop something similar and better. After all, whoever wrote the software behind the key was presumably still around. And/or, there are other genius software developers, like, EVERYWHERE. Sheesh!In short, NOT recommended.",

        "content": "Ah, Valentine's Day. Love is in the air, chocolate is everywhere, and fights ensue every five minutes. Great holiday.The biggest draw to this movie is likely going to be Ke Huy Quan, beloved 80's kid star and recent Oscar winner. He is clearly giving it his all, both acting- and action-wise, with a performance I can best describe as friendly, making Marvin Gable someone you'd root for no matter what. Everyone else in the movie does well as well, with the other notable standout being Ariana DeBose as Rose. Other than a few lines that feel a bit over-the-top, she brings a fun presence to the movie.The other big sell, the action, is another reason that's worth the price of admission. Director Jonathan Eusebio, known for stunt coordination on several other projects including John Wick, manages to make the fights a joy in every situation. The camera isn't steady all of the time, but unlike most shaky cam, it works in a way to make the fights feel chaotic while still maintaining a clear sense of what is going on. It also helps that there are several unique setpieces to the fights, including the weaponry of choice by Mustafa Shakir's character The Raven.Besides the leads and the action, the story is admittedly very light. While the trailer's hook is interesting, there isn't much going on in the plot save for one minor subplot that isn't expounded upon, but I thought had a neat little payoff for all the little details throughout. It does work to the movie's favor as a quick 80-minute action flick, but those hoping for more substance will undoubtedly be disappointed. The other criticism I have is that there are several moments of handholding throughout. There will be a focus on an object or setpiece, then a character will say something to the effect of \"I can use this\" or \"Ah, I recognize this\" rather than letting the visual cues clue the audience in.If you can look past the empty-calorie story, I recommend this, especially if you're looking for a Valentine's Day date at the movies. It's an easy watch that pairs well with a dinner afterward. Not much else Valentines-themed this month anyway. Unless you like slashers, in which case Heart Eyes may be more up your alley.",

        "content": "My main issue with this film is the revenge plot. Simple, yes, but boy does it absolutely make no sense. Ke is a former trained assassin and his brother, Knuckles (I swear knuckles is a sonic character), is the head of the faction (unknown what the faction does or is for, just that they launder money). Ke's love interest is someone who worked for his brother and stole money from him during an important job (she was simultaneously set up but also somehow purposefully did it? It was confusing). Knuckles orders Ke to kill her, and if he does, he grants Ke the freedom to leave the faction and live his own life. Ke spares her life and tells her to hide. They both get away with hiding, until the film begins. What is extremely confusing about the plot is that the love interest sends out a bunch of letters and documents of the money laundering crimes (from that specific job) to Knuckles and his crew to taunt them. This sends them on her trail. She seeks out and finds Ke to reunite but also push him to go back to his \"assassin era\" which he has very much expressed he is ashamed of?? She claims she needs his help to get \"her life back\", because she's stuck being a bartender at a strip club. We never find out what this old \"life\" of hers that she wants back looks like. She ditches Ke after failing to convince him to fight with her, so she pushes his limits and walks into the lion's den (Knuckles's territory) knowing Ke would follow her and essentially fight everybody there (including Knuckles). Once Knuckles and his gang are all defeated, the girl reveals that all of the documents she taunted them with at the beginning exposed Knuckles to have betrayed his higher up allies, some Russians from a different, more powerful faction, so the Russians (having already received this info prior) burst in and grab Knuckles and pay her money for the info. Then the film ends with her and Ke kissing and her going back to bartending. The love interest's motivations are extremely confusing to me and quite stupid. She claims to want her old life back, but goes back to bartending at the end of the film? So how did defeating Knuckles help her get her old life back? I also thought it was weird that she constantly claimed to want Ke's help, often pressuring him to return to his old ways (which he expressed explicitly multiple times to have been ashamed of and just desired a normal simple life) and yet the entire time she had already sent all that dirty info on Knuckes to the Russians. So what was the point, then? Why not stay in hiding until the Russians captured Knuckles and then return to that \"old life\" she claimed to want back.",

        "content": "Ever since Ke Huy Quan won the Academy Award, cementing his acting career comeback, I've been in full support of whatever he does. The new action romantic comedy LOVE HURTS is seriously testing that support. Marvin (Ke Huy Quan) is one of the best realtors in town. When his dark and violent past comes back and threatens the new life he's built, he's forced to face it head on. There is so much that doesn't work in this movie. First, the story sucks. Marvin thought that having his face plastered around town was a good way of laying low after betraying his crime boss boba- drinking brother Alvin \"Knuckles\" (Daniel Wu). Marvin's betrayal consisted of saving the life of his love interest Rose (Ariana DeBose), who comes back into his life like a wrecking ball because \"Hiding ain't living\". I have never seen two characters in a romance have less chemistry. I always try and use my big words, but not here: He feels like a \"simp\" and she feels like an a**hole who uses him like a tool. The side characters were a little more interesting and fun, which isn't a good sign. Quan reunites with his GOONIES co-star Sean Astin, who actually has a good scene. Drew Scott (from the Property Brothers) has a funny scene, as does football player Marshawn Lynch. The antagonist has zero character development, which should've been easy to add in, since he's Marvin's estranged brother. The action scenes were not bad, but it felt like they were playing it safe. Even though the movie is 83 minutes long, it still feels too long. LOVE HURTS is a Valentine's Day movie with commitment issues with half-baked subplots and a cookie-cutter ending. Just watch the trailer, that's basically the movie.",

        "title": "Here's the Brutal Truth About Love Hurts...",
        "content": "Love Hurts is a straightforward action film with a touch of drama, but make no mistake-this is a \"one-man army\" kind of movie. It's the type of film that thrives on plot armor, where the protagonist is outnumbered but somehow manages to take down everyone in his path. Is it better than John Wick? Definitely not. Is it better than Nobody? Not really. But does it beat some of Jason Statham's more forgettable action flicks? Surprisingly, yes.The story itself is simple, almost too simple. At 83 minutes (credits included), it knows when to wrap things up without overstaying its welcome. But even with its short runtime, the pacing feels uneven. There's an unbalanced mix of action and drama, with the middle part of the film filled with repetitive dialogues that stretch out the story instead of adding depth. The film had the opportunity to introduce more compelling subplots but chose not to, leaving certain moments feeling dragged out rather than dynamic.One of the biggest frustrations is how the film teases a truly interesting character, only to cut away just when things get exciting. There's a moment where you expect an intense, game-changing sequence, but instead, it's skipped entirely. It becomes a classic case of \"tell, don't show,\" which feels like a missed opportunity.That being said, Ke Huy Quan brings something fresh to the action genre. He's not your typical tall, muscular action star, but he nails his role in a way that feels both cheeky and authentic. He's quick, agile, and entertaining to watch. And while the plot armor is undeniably strong, at least the film acknowledges that his character, Marvin Gable, is human-he takes hits, gets knocked down, and even bleeds. This adds some believability to his fights, making them more engaging.However, Marvin Gable as a character feels a bit two-dimensional. We get glimpses of his past, but not enough to truly understand who he is or why he's being hunted. There's potential for a deeper backstory, but instead of expanding on it, the film keeps circling around the same few details. It feels like it's dragging itself down with repetition rather than moving forward with meaningful character development.Ariana DeBose, on the other hand, brings plenty of energy as his partner-in-crime. She's witty, charming, and completely self-serving in the most entertaining way possible. She's chaotic, but not quite Harley Quinn levels of crazy-more like a playful, opportunistic wildcard. She adds a layer of fun to the film, making her scenes a highlight.As for the action, it's not as gory as John Wick or Nobody, but it's still brutal enough to satisfy action fans. The choreography is slick, yet somewhat goofy-kind of like Kick-Ass, where the fights blend both realism and over-the-top action. Not every hit lands perfectly, not every move is executed flawlessly, and that imperfection actually adds to the charm.The film also tries to introduce a unique element with \"love letters\" as a recurring theme, tying it to a Valentine's vibe. But while the idea is interesting, the execution feels underwhelming. The letters don't add much emotional weight, and instead of feeling special, they come across as just another detail in the film.Verdict: Love Hurts is a quite fun but flawed action film. The performances, especially from Ke Huy Quan and Ariana DeBose, bring life to the story, and the fight sequences are enjoyable in a raw, slightly clumsy way. But the uneven pacing, lack of depth in the protagonist's backstory, and missed opportunities hold it back from being truly great. It's entertaining for what it is, but don't expect anything groundbreaking.",

        "title": "Too goofy for the action to be impactful",
        "content": "\"Love Hurts\" had promise. At least, the trailer made it seem so. Advertised as a sort of martial arts action/comedy/romance hybrid - starring everyone's favorite Ke Huy Quan (and not to mention the lovely Ariana DeBose), the film looked to be, at the least, a fun little Valentine's Day adventure with some competent, violent fighting. And with its 83 minute runtime? Gosh, \"Love Hurts\" has to be nothing but a lean, fast-paced action extravaganza... right? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is: No. \"Love Hurts\" is a poor film, and it pains me to say that, as I was genuinely looking forward to this. However, within minutes of the movie beginning, I realized that the optimal viewing experience would've been at home rather than on the silver screen.I don't want to waste time talking about the plot (it's practically non-existent) or the acting (everyone does an okay job with the material they have, but virtually all are hamming it up to an absurd degree); instead, I want to jump right into why you're going to see this movie - the action. Is the action in \"Love Hurts\" good? On a technical level, yes. The action itself is filmed well, and you can tell that some real care was put into the choreography. Additionally the camera work is quite good, almost never shaky, and likes to follow the action around in smooth takes and wide angles. The martial arts spectacle at play here can be satisfying if you're into that sort of thing, and there's a third-act fight inside of a home that is genuinely exciting.My issues with the action, however, are twofold. For one, the film just doesn't have enough action in it. For a movie that's only 83 minutes long, there is barely any action at all; you get a little bit in the very beginning of the movie, and then nothing until the final 15 or 20 minutes or so - this was shocking to me, and turned the film into a boring slog where I was sitting there waiting for something - anything - to happen. Secondly, because of the goofy, almost parody-esque tone of the film, the action lacks impact and feels ridiculous. I understand that \"Love Hurts\" wanted to be a fun, breezy date night kind of movie, but the tone was so light and so silly that the action and the violence felt neutered, even with its at times copious amounts of bloodshed. And so, while I could admire the action from a filmmaking perspective, it never really left any impression on me because the over the top tone of the film kept me from getting invested in the violence.The best way I can describe how it felt like to watch \"Love Hurts\" is to say that it's like watching a live-action cartoon. And for some people, that might sound awesome! For me, I would've preferred a bit more of a grounded take that allowed some semblance of seriousness instead of the ridiculous final product. Will you like this? You might find the action enjoyable, but I can't imagine that you'll enjoy how little action there truly is - and how long you have to wait to finally see some.",

Watch that, and you've got pretty much the best (and most comedic) parts of the story. This had the dumbest, most cringe execution of a story I've seen in a while. It tried to be an action comedy, but the comedy didn't work so well most of the time, and the tone between the two was all mismatched with plotlines that were nonsensical and a waste of time in addition to horrific killings that just didn't mix effectively with the rest of the story. Some black comedies work very well - Companion is a perfect example. This wasn't really a black comedy though, and the moments that it tried to be serious in other situations - love between the characters - felt so lame and cringe I was rolling my eyes too many times to count. It's disappointing to have that experience, since Love Hurts had ended up on my list of most anticipated for 2025.

        "title": "Love Hurts - A Movie So Stupid, It Hurts",
        "content": "I'm going to get straight to the point-Love Hurts is one of the most incoherent, sloppily written, and frustratingly stupid movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. Directed by Jonathan Eusebio and starring Ke Huy Quan as Marvin Gable, this film is a complete mess that fails in almost every aspect except for its fight choreography. But good fight scenes don't mean anything when the story, characters, and basic logic are all thrown out the window.The film follows Marvin, a real estate agent who somehow gets tangled up in an assassin plot involving his estranged brother Alvin (Daniel Wu), his supposed love interest Rose (Ariana DeBose), and a series of events so nonsensical that even turning your brain off won't help.A Masterclass in Incompetence\nLet's start with the small, irritating details that immediately tell you the filmmakers didn't care. Right at the beginning, Marvin leaves his garage door wide open when heading to work. When he returns, the garage is magically closed. This kind of careless filmmaking sets the tone for the entire movie-nothing makes sense, and no one involved seems to have been paying attention.Then there's the first fight scene, where Marvin gets a large knife stabbed through his hand, yet continues using it like nothing happened. Minutes later, he gets tackled, stabbed in the shoulder, and thrown out of a window. Does this affect him at all? Nope. He pulls the knife out, leaps over six fences like an Olympic athlete, and escapes completely fine. If the movie had established that Marvin was some kind of superhuman, maybe I'd buy it-but he's just a normal guy. This kind of nonsense takes you right out of the film.The Stupidest Subplot Ever Written\nAt around the 25-minute mark, the movie somehow gets even dumber. Marvin's secretary finds a dead guy in his office and, instead of calling the police like a sane person, calls Marvin's answering machine and leaves a message about it. Then she reads a poem from the dead guy's diary and quits her job. Yes, this is actually what happens.But wait, it gets worse! The \"dead\" guy suddenly wakes up, hears his poem being read, and falls in love with the secretary on the spot. And she falls for him too. This is supposed to be a comedy, but the writing is so absurdly stupid that it doesn't land as humor-it just makes you wonder if anyone in the production even read the script before filming.The Love Story That Doesn't Exist\nFor a movie that's supposed to be about love and action, Love Hurts does a terrible job establishing any believable romance. Marvin and Rose are supposed to be in love, but why? The movie never gives us a reason to care about their relationship. Meanwhile, the film spends more time on the secretary's love life with a would-be assassin than on the actual main couple. By the time Marvin is rushing to \"save\" Rose, it feels like an obligation rather than something meaningful.The Ending - A Merciful Relief\nBy the time we reach the final act, everything is completely off the rails. Marvin's secretary, for no explained reason, suddenly hates him and helps her assassin boyfriend try to kill him. Marvin ends up fighting a group of henchmen in a house he's trying to sell, the assassin kills his own allies for no reason, and Marvin ultimately lets him live because the secretary begs him to. No consequences, no weight-just more stupidity.Then Marvin rushes off to save Rose, fights his brother, wins, and Rose shoots Alvin but doesn't kill him. Instead, she reveals that she \"told the Russians everything,\" and suddenly a group of Russians show up and take Alvin away. Marvin and Rose then drive off into the sunset with a bag full of money.That's it. That's the movie. No emotional payoff, no satisfying character arcs, just a series of random events stitched together with poorly explained motivations and idiotic character decisions.Final Verdict\nThe only redeeming quality in Love Hurts is the fight choreography, which is admittedly well-executed. But no amount of well-shot action can save a movie this brain-dead. The script is laughably bad, the characters are paper-thin, and the entire plot feels like it was thrown together in a single afternoon with no revisions. It's not even the kind of \"so bad it's good\" fun you get from movies like The Room-it's just frustratingly stupid.Love Hurts isn't just a bad movie-it's the kind of film that makes you question if modern filmmakers even care about storytelling anymore. This disaster earns a 1 out of 10, and the only reason it's not a zero is because I've seen worse cinematography in student films.Do yourself a favor: skip this one.",

I'd recommend this and would happily revisit it, I'd imagine the rewatchability is pretty high. The pure action is great to watch, there is some top stunt work on show. It's super satisfying to see unfold.Ke Huy Quan brings a strong lead performance, as he is supported competently by Ariana DeBose - who has been extremely busy this last year or two, not that that's a negative as I do enjoy seeing her. Daniel Wu, Marshawn Lynch, André Eriksen and Sean Astin are decent too.Mustafa Shakir is the best behind Quan/DeBose, probably the best character overall in terms of the look, body language etc. Also, is it just me (most likely) or does he look/sound like he'd be a perfect Scar from 'The Lion King' - I can't unsee it. If Disney ever go 'Cats'-esque shudder, he's their man.It makes little sense and is too silly in certain moments, granted. However, I had the desired amount of fun with it.",

        "content": "LIKES:\nFun\nFunny\nSome Good Fights\nThe Acting Is Involved\nSome Deeper Meanings\nFun Subplots\nSummary:\nThe synopsis I gave will hopefully set the tone that this movie is not a serious entry into the movie collection by any means. It's goofy, and that goofiness is fun to watch and get lost in for a short amount of time to just give your mind a break. Love Hurts is a comedy before anything else, as it combines a lot of elements that are hilarious to enjoy. Pokes at Martial Arts movies, more jabs at the Valentine empire, and the folly of modern loves. I enjoyed the overdramatic delivery of one character, making every piece of advice comical, while another's somber and poetic tones are strange and time perfectly to be funny rather than disturbing. There are plenty of insults, slapstick humor, and environmental mishaps that feel like a silly version of John Wick, and it worked well on many parts for me in that pure spectacle Eusebio directed it toward achieving. Speaking of fights, the action scenes sometimes nail the choreography to be exciting, impressive, and unique with the kung fu of Bruce Lee meeting the humor of Jackie Chan. Love Hurts made me... well... hurt when you see some of the blows that Quan throws in this movie at the extras. It's violent, it's fast(ish), and feels a bit like a video game with the props and planning that this movie adopted. It leads to a fast and fun pace that keeps your brain numb, and a movie like this is enjoyable when you go in with such a mindset.There are a few deeper elements to the film, the main plot of Marvin's tale holding elements much more in tune with character growth and reflections on life. It's spiritual and almost meditative, a relevant character who is looking for happiness and finding it means that many characters don't quite match up with in other films. Other characters surprisingly have a bit more bite to them as well, not just secondary characters, but tertiary ones whose subplots are cute, entertaining, and offer a little anchor away from the violence that is the main plot. The little dance they do is all in line with the spirit of fun, and the actors all manage to be very fun and immersed in the movie, though a few seem less committed to the characters and don't bring their A-game as they do in other works. Still, Love Hurts surprised me with the expansion into other tributaries to help provide some balance.DISLIKES\nToo Violent/Aggressive Withy Language\nPlot is Cliché/Predictable\nSubplots are underdeveloped/rushed\nFighting comes off stiff at times\nThe Acting Is Inconsistent\nToo Stupid At Times\nToo Little Time To Juggle Everything\nSummary:\nThe movie is extreme in a lot of ways, though, and the result is a movie being chopped up and a little lacking in many elements to make some of the points fall for me. The acting is, for the most part, appropriate, most of the cast having fun with their parts and just letting their dramatic personalities unfold in manners very appropriate for the film. It's just not consistent, and some of the actors feel a tad dry and uncommitted to the role, only managing to give me convincing performances in the film. The plot is cliché and predictable, any attempts at twists washed away by the excessive comedy sweeping away the serious plot twists and character developments. The subplots suffer in their length and feel lacking or hastily tied up with a single-shot montage that feels shallow and kind of benign. As for the dialog, well, the movie gets aggressive with the foul language, losing the spice factor for that \"realistic\" angle that so many people seem okay to have. As. If this weren't enough, the movie also starts to run into problems with the action elements for a viewer like me. The film pays homage to the great fights well, but many times, it feels stiff, uncoordinated, and repetitive in the embellishments they took with this film. I don't know how legit the fights are, but Love Hurts seems a bit blocky and forced battles (like the Acolyte) and gets paired with John Wick damage syndrome that loses an edge when you see how much punishment our \"hero\" can take. All of this comes out very stupid and silly at times, leaving me bored and wishing to steer away from the comedy elements to meet closer to the middle or add some more unique and coordinated elements to make up for the cliché. All-in-all, most of these things could have been improved secondary to having more time, the eighty-two minute run time not giving much wiggle room to keep all these tales and characters in an appropriate balance, in my opinion. About twenty more minutes could have done wonders for this film, or perhaps cleaned up the cast a tad more to not cram so many thin strings into this complex web.The VERDICT\nLove Hurts is another fine edition of the Valentine film parody that is very entertaining to watch. It's simply kung fu in an odd love story, and that ridiculous summary extends into the film's comedic focus with action elements to support the fast-paced film. You'll find plenty of styles to laugh at, alongside some awesome fights that feel closer to real-life anime than the actual real-life anime films we have. The pace is just purely fun, but other plots might stoke the fires of hope and well-being if you pay attention to them. However, this odd combination is not going to win much in the general audience, depending on your tolerance for violence, excessive language, and the amount of stupid humor and aggressive comedy you'll get in the short run time. Love Hurts has a lot of potential, but it's squandered by how short the film is and how many characters/sub-plots they tried to weave together in that time frame. Is it the worst thing to hit theaters? No, but the movie still needs a little more polish, planning, and precision to be worth the full recommendation to see in the theater. It's definitely going to be action lovers and comedy junkies who can't get enough as the niche audience, while the majority will probably get the most at watching at home. My scores for Love Hurts are:\nAction/Comedy: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",

I was looking forward to seeing Ke Huy Quan in his own action film (gotta support a Goonie!) and this film def delivered on creatively choreographed action sequences. The lighting and framing throughout gave the film a bit of a comic book feel. The plot was simple but the writing was a let down. The main antagonist's story wasn't very clear and it relies on a lot of inner monologues to explain what's going on, which was distracting. It hopped around quite a bit and wasn't very cohesive. It felt like lazy writing just to get a Valentine's film out. This film is entirely supported by several key cast members (two of which have Oscar's). But if you go in expecting 1.5 hrs of a camp romp punctuated by impressively choreographed fight scenes, with a couple notable cameos, I think you'll still have fun with this silly, fun movie. I hope KHQ gets more action films as a main character because he's brilliant when he's allowed to shine.",

        "title": "Ke Huy Quan certainly has the chops for an action comedy like this, but an unpolished and underdeveloped delivery make it feel like little more than proof of concept",
        "content": "Set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Marvin Gable (Ke Huy Quan) is seemingly a successful realtor who will help you find your dream home. However, following an encounter with an assassin known as the Raven (Mustafa Shakir), Marvin finds his new life under threat from his old one as the re-emergence of his last kill, Rose (Ariana DeBose), whom he didn't actually kill puts him on a collision course with his estranged gangster brother Alvin \"Knuckles\" Gable (Daniel Wu).Love Hurts is the latest genre film from 87North Productions, better known for their production of the John Wick series of films that helped redefine modern action cinema. The film marks Ke Huy Quan's first lead role following his Oscar winning comeback in Everything Everywhere All at Once and while I think Quan is perfectly capable of headlining a film like this, I just wish it were a more interesting one.While Quan doesn't have the richest role as Marvin, I will say that there is sort of a meek charm at watching this small unassuming realtor unleash martial arts fury upon hoards of would be assassins. If Jackie Chan (at his peak anyway) could be described as Buster Keaton with martial arts, Quan's style is more akin to Harold Lloyd where there's a bit more of an edge to the disaster prone hi-jinks. Honestly during the opening 20 minutes I didn't really understand why the movie had been so panned by critics as some of the physical comedy seemed on point and the fight scenes had the typical 87North quality....but then the movie started to lose me. Running at only 87 minutes long the movie isn't unaware of what it is and gets right to the point, but that's kind of part of the problem as there isn't a lot of time spent developing character or setting up the circumstances.When you compare Love Hurts to 87North's other comedic action film Nobody which had a solid and efficient first act establishing the mid-life stagnation of Bob Odenkirk's character that set up effective contrast to the more outlandish elements later on, Love Hurts dives in way too fast and we don't really get a chance to know the characters beyond the surface level. The movie encounters further issues with Ariana DeBose' Rose and the actions taken by her character which the movie tries to frame as being for Marvin's benefit but because we never took time to establish Marvin's life we don't know that and it seems like she's nuking his new life because \"why not?\". The movie per its title also tries to paint itself as a romantic unconventional Valentine's Day film clunkily establishing a romance between Marvin and Rose along with Marshawn Lynch's King and Andre Erisken's Otis discussing marital problems or Marvin secretary Ashley played by Lio Tipton falling for poetic assassin Raven played by Mustafa Shakir and while occasionally there's a sequence that works, most of it just feels limp especially in comparison to 87North's The Fall Guy which mixed action and romantic comedy much more effectively. Even the usually reliable fight work loses integrity in the final act as there's a disappointing number of cuts and close-up shots that make the final fight so underwhelming.Love Hurts isn't without some charms (most of them courtesy of Quan), but the film never fully comes together in alive in a way the marketing promises and it feels like a half-hearted remix of prior 87North productions that did similar things much more successfully. Quan's more than capable of headlining a film like this, I just wish the film itself were better.",

I saw this film in theater and I still got motion sickness.The narrative was abysmal. The whole message of the movie, that of 'hiding isn't living' is nonsensical within the confines of the narrative. Quan's character isn't hiding and we never get the implication that he is, he's made a new life with which he is happy and yet the narrative itself thinks he's hiding. The plot is so standard, if you've seen any action movie then you've already seen this one. I called each and every plot moment a mile away.

        "content": "Watching freshman director Jonathan Eusebio's \"Love Hurts\" reminded me of those lightweight but exuberant Jackie Chan martial arts adventures with the pint-sized Chan kicking the shenanigans out of assailants twice his size who always outnumber him. Similarly, leading man Ke Huy Quan resembles a middle-aged crazy Chan as he swaps blows with a variety of larger-than-life cretins armed with either guns or knives. Universal Pictures is selling this furiously, fast-paced, 83-minute epic as a Valentine-themed film, but Cupid isn't shooting arrows into the hearts of the hero and heroine. Basically, scenarists Matthew Murray and Josh Stoddard, with Luke Passmore penning a rewrite, deliver the equivalent of \"Nobody\" meets \"John Wick.\" Most of the sporadic but spectacular fight choreography is orchestrated like a martial arts marathon. Usually, the hero winds up battling two or more bad guys at a time. Ke Huy Quan appears to have performed all his own gravity defying stunts. Moreover, the writers do a solid job of aligning our sympathies with his hero, a harmless real estate agent named Martin Gable. Not only are the villains are fiendish intimidating, but they are also dastardly and brandish a variety of firearms and razor-sharp blades. The chief villain, Alvin 'Knuckles' Gable (Daniel Wu of \"New Police Story\"), qualifies as obnoxious with a stone-cold heart who has no qualms about killing innocent bystanders. Remember how \"John Wick\" dispatched some of his adversaries the first \"John Wick\" outing with a number two lead pencil? 'Knuckles' prefers to wield the equivalent of an ordinary straw. You know your waitress gives you with your drinks. The enormity of his villainy occurs when he kills one of the nicer characters just to validate his evil credentials. Interestingly enough, the heroine Rose Carlisle (Ariana DeBose of \"Kraven the Hunter\") precipitates this orgy of violence when she decides to resurrect himself from obscurity to pay back the wicked reprobates who hired our hero to kill her in the first place. The formulaic excuse of a plot that prompts all the splendidly choregraphed combat scenes in everyday, ordinary places, is disposable. It seems, our harmless looking hero was once a world-class assassin who went straight after he faked the death of his girlfriend, Rose, so she could live a peaceful life without repercussions. When the plot unfolds, Rose shows up and decides to shake up everybody. For the record, if you saw \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,\" then you've seen Ke Huy Quan but you won't recognize him because he played 'Short Round' the tike who chauffeured around Indy with a block of wood on his shoe so he could reach the gas pedal. You may also remember him as 'Data' in \"The Goonies.\" Clearly, he stand in for Jackie Chan in movies that would have been made to star Chan.",

Blending breakneck fight sequences with razor-sharp wit, this film delivers a delightful mix of heart-pounding action and laugh-out-loud moments, anchored by a stellar ensemble cast.At the center of the mayhem is Ke Huy Quan, who shines as Marvin Gable, a reformed assassin turned real estate agent whose past literally comes knocking at his door. Quan brings an effortless blend of charm, physicality, and comedic timing to the role, making Marvin an instantly likable protagonist. Ariana DeBose is equally captivating as Rose, Marvin's former target-turned-long-lost love, injecting the film with an irresistible blend of danger and allure.The supporting cast elevates the film even further. Daniel Wu's ruthless yet magnetic portrayal of Alvin \"Knuckles\" Gable makes for a formidable antagonist, while Mustafa Shakir's smooth but untrustworthy Renny Merlow adds layers of intrigue. However, one of the biggest scene-stealers is Marshawn Lynch, who, as the knife-wielding, poetry-loving Raven, delivers an unexpected comedic performance that lands every time. His dynamic with Kausar Mohammed's hilariously disillusioned assistant Ashley brings a fresh and quirky romance into the mix.Eusebio, best known for his stunt choreography in John Wick and Birds of Prey, makes his directorial debut with a film that showcases his mastery of action. The fight sequences are kinetic and creative, blending gun-fu, brutal hand-to-hand combat, and even a real estate closing that turns into an all-out brawl. The choreography is crisp, inventive, and never overstays its welcome, keeping the film's energy consistently high.Beyond the action, Love Hurts boasts a script filled with sharp dialogue and genuine laughs. The film balances its over-the-top violence with heartfelt moments, never losing sight of its central theme: embracing both the past and the future. The Valentine's Day backdrop adds an ironic touch of romance, with love-whether rekindled, newfound, or hilariously misguided-woven into every plot thread.By the time the final showdown unfolds, Love Hurts has delivered a rollercoaster of adrenaline, humor, and heart. With its pitch-perfect cast, breathtaking action, and unexpectedly sweet moments, this film cements itself as a must-watch for fans of Mr. & Mrs. Smith and The Nice Guys.",

The protagonist isn't just flawed-he's outright infuriating, making a series of bizarre and senseless decisions that make it impossible to root for him.A Protagonist Who Causes His Own MiseryThe biggest problem with the movie is the main character's incompetence. At first, I expected him to grow throughout the film, but instead, he spends the entire story making terrible decisions that lead to disaster.He allows his lover to marry someone else, despite clearly having feelings for her.He lets his sister fully embrace her demon side, which ultimately causes her to kill his lover.Then, instead of taking responsibility for his role in all of this, he decides to kill his own sister, even though he stood by and let everything happen.This entire chain of events could have been avoided if he had acted like a rational person. He never takes a stand when it matters but suddenly wants to act like a hero when it's too late.A Plot That Feels Forced and UnnaturalThe storyline is filled with unnecessary tragedy that seems to exist only for shock value, rather than being the result of natural character development. The protagonist could have done anything to prevent these events, but he simply stands by and lets them unfold, making him one of the most frustrating main characters I've ever seen.The biggest issue is that the movie tries to make us sympathize with him after all his mistakes, but it's impossible to feel sorry for someone who actively allowed everything to go wrong. Instead of making him seem like a tragic hero, the film makes him look like a spineless fool who only reacts after the damage is done.Wasted Potential of Supporting CharactersThere are several characters in this movie who deserved a better story. His sister, for example, had the potential to be a deeply complex villain-but the writing fails her by making her descent into darkness feel forced and unearned. His lover also gets zero agency in the story, existing only to be a tragic plot device. Instead of well-written characters, we get a series of bad decisions leading to a predictable disaster.Action and Animation Can't Save the StoryI will admit that the fight scenes and animation (if applicable) are decent. However, cool action sequences mean nothing when the story is this bad. It's hard to care about the fights when you don't care about the protagonist. Instead of feeling emotionally invested, I was just waiting for the movie to end.Final Verdict: A Complete Waste of TimeSword of the Demon Hunter is an absolute train wreck of a story. It forces tragedy through the protagonist's stupid decisions, making it impossible to sympathize with him. If you enjoy well-written fantasy stories with strong character development, this is NOT the movie for you.Final Rating: 1/10.",

The story follows Jinta, a stoic shrine guardian turned demon hunter, as he traverses centuries in his quest to fulfill a mysterious promise. What makes this series truly stand out is its seamless transition between peaceful village life and brutal, demon-slaying action.

Whether you're a fan of folklore, time-travel elements, or simply looking for a fresh take on the demon-slaying genre, Kijin Gentosho delivers a unique and engaging journey. It's a must-read for fans of mature, thoughtful fantasy with emotional depth.",
